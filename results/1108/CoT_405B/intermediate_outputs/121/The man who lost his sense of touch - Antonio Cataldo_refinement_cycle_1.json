    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In what year did Ian Waterman's symptoms of a rare form of deafferentation first appear?\n    - A: 1965\n    - B: 1971\n    - C: 1975\n    - D: 1980\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which type of receptors are responsible for sensing mechanical deformation of the skin?\n    - A: Thermoreceptors\n    - B: Mechanoreceptors\n    - C: Nociceptors\n    - D: Propriocepters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of the somatosensory system in movement?\n    - A: To regulate body temperature\n    - B: To provide feedback on the body's position and sensations\n    - C: To control muscle contractions\n    - D: To facilitate neural transmission\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is a potential consequence of damage to the somatosensory system?\n    - A: Enhanced sensory perception\n    - B: Improved motor control\n    - C: Difficulty gauging strength and reacting to damage\n    - D: Increased neural plasticity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How can understanding the somatosensory system help individuals with somatosensory disorders?\n    - A: By providing a cure for the disorder\n    - B: By allowing them to ignore their symptoms\n    - C: By helping them adapt and find innovative ways to navigate the world\n    - D: By reducing their reliance on other senses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential application of knowledge about the somatosensory system in healthcare settings?\n    - A: Reducing the importance of social touch\n    - B: Informing the development of treatments for somatosensory disorders\n    - C: Ignoring the role of touch in patient care\n    - D: Focusing solely on pharmacological interventions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the somatosensory system and movement?\n    - A: The somatosensory system is only involved in regulating body temperature\n    - B: The somatosensory system provides feedback on the body's position and sensations, which is essential for motor control\n    - C: The somatosensory system is only responsible for transmitting pain signals\n    - D: The somatosensory system is not involved in movement\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the main difference between mechanoreceptors and thermoreceptors?\n    - A: Mechanoreceptors respond to temperature changes, while thermoreceptors sense mechanical deformation\n    - B: Mechanoreceptors sense mechanical deformation, while thermoreceptors respond to temperature changes\n    - C: Mechanoreceptors are only found in the skin, while thermoreceptors are found in muscles and tendons\n    - D: Mechanoreceptors are responsible for transmitting pain signals, while thermoreceptors are involved in proprioception\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be gained by combining knowledge of the somatosensory system with understanding of other sensory systems?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the neural basis of sensation and movement\n    - B: A greater appreciation for the importance of social touch\n    - C: Insights into the complex interactions between senses\n    - D: A better understanding of the role of the somatosensory system in regulating body temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can be learned by integrating information about somatosensory disorders with knowledge of neurological conditions?\n    - A: The importance of ignoring somatosensory symptoms\n    - B: The role of the somatosensory system in social touch and emotional well-being\n    - C: A deeper understanding of the neural basis of sensation and movement\n    - D: The effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for somatosensory disorders\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a potential consequence of touch starvation?\n    - A: Improved motor control\n    - B: Enhanced sensory perception\n    - C: Long-term effects on physical and mental health, such as anxiety and depression\n    - D: Increased neural plasticity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of treatments for somatosensory disorders?\n    - A: Only the benefits of the treatment\n    - B: Only the limitations of the treatment\n    - C: The benefits and limitations of different approaches\n    - D: The role of the somatosensory system in regulating body temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 1, 8, 11, and 12 to improve clarity and concision. The remaining questions did not require significant refinement."
