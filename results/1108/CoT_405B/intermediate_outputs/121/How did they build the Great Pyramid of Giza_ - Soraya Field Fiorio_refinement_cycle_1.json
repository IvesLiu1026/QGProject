Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) When did Pharaoh Khufu begin construction on his tomb?\n    - A: 2500 BCE\n    - B: 2575 BCE\n    - C: 2600 BCE\n    - D: 2625 BCE\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Approximately how many workers were involved in the construction of the Great Pyramid?\n    - A: 10,000 workers\n    - B: 20,000 workers\n    - C: 25,000 workers\n    - D: 30,000 workers\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why did the Egyptians choose the west bank of the Nile as the construction site for the Great Pyramid?\n    - A: Because it was closer to the quarrying sites\n    - B: Because it was more accessible to the workers\n    - C: Because death was associated with the setting sun and the west\n    - D: Because the plateau provided a stable foundation\n[Correct answer]: C (Note: I added a more accurate distractor D, as the plateau's stability was also a factor)\n\n4) What was the purpose of the multiple burial chambers inside the Great Pyramid?\n    - A: To provide additional storage space\n    - B: To create a maze for intruders\n    - C: To support the pyramid's exterior structure\n    - D: To ensure the pharaoh had an accessible burial chamber at all times\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) Which industry could benefit from the organizational skills and labor management techniques used by Hemiunu?\n    - A: Healthcare\n    - B: Finance\n    - C: Construction\n    - D: Technology\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How could the construction techniques used in the Great Pyramid be applied to modern-day building projects?\n    - A: By using only traditional materials\n    - B: By constructing buildings with a similar pyramid shape\n    - C: By using a large, skilled workforce and a well-planned construction site\n    - D: By incorporating advanced technology\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What was the relationship between the pyramid's design and its materials?\n    - A: The pyramid's design was unrelated to its materials\n    - B: The pyramid's design and materials were carefully chosen to ensure its stability and durability\n    - C: The pyramid's design was more important than its materials\n    - D: The pyramid's materials were more important than its design\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What was the impact of the pyramid's construction on ancient Egyptian society?\n    - A: The pyramid's construction had no impact on ancient Egyptian society\n    - B: The pyramid's construction led to the decline of ancient Egyptian society\n    - C: The pyramid's construction contributed to the growth and development of ancient Egyptian society\n    - D: The pyramid's construction was a result of the decline of ancient Egyptian society\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How could the knowledge of the pyramid's construction be combined with modern-day materials and techniques?\n    - A: By using only traditional materials and techniques\n    - B: By incorporating modern materials and techniques into traditional designs\n    - C: By creating new designs that blend ancient and modern elements\n    - D: By ignoring the lessons of the past\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What new narrative could be created about the Great Pyramid's construction?\n    - A: A story about a group of workers who discovered a hidden treasure\n    - B: A story about a pharaoh who built the pyramid as a monument to his ego\n    - C: A story about an architect who designed the pyramid using advanced mathematical techniques\n    - D: A story about the pyramid's construction process\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) How effective were Hemiunu's design and construction techniques?\n    - A: Very ineffective, as the pyramid collapsed shortly after construction\n    - B: Somewhat ineffective, as the pyramid showed signs of instability\n    - C: Effective, as the pyramid remained stable for thousands of years\n    - D: Extremely effective, as the pyramid was perfect\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why were limestone and granite used in the pyramid's construction?\n    - A: For their aesthetic appeal\n    - B: For their durability and stability\n    - C: Because they were readily available\n    - D: Because they were the cheapest option\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 1-3, 5-7, and 9-12 to improve clarity and concision. I also revised question 4 to focus on the purpose of the multiple burial chambers, and question 8 to focus on the impact of the pyramid's construction on ancient Egyptian society. Additionally, I changed question 10 to make it more open-ended, allowing for creative and innovative responses."
