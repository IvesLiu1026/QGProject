    "initial_questions": "Unfortunately, without the transcript, I cannot create the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level. However, I can guide you through the process and provide examples based on a hypothetical transcript.\n\nLet's assume a transcript about climate change:\n\n**Hypothetical Transcript**:\n\"Climate change is a pressing issue worldwide. Rising temperatures are causing melting of polar ice caps, leading to sea-level rise. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Governments and individuals can work together to reduce carbon footprints and mitigate the effects of climate change. This can be achieved by investing in renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and adopting sustainable land use practices.\"\n\n**Content Analysis**:\n\n1. **Knowledge**:\n    - Climate change is a global issue.\n    - Human activities contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.\n    - Polar ice caps are melting due to rising temperatures.\n\n2. **Comprehension**:\n    - Understanding the relationship between human activities and climate change.\n    - Recognizing the impact of climate change on the environment.\n\n3. **Application**:\n    - Implementing sustainable practices to reduce carbon footprints.\n    - Investing in renewable energy sources.\n\n4. **Analysis**:\n    - Examining the cause-and-effect connections between human activities and climate change.\n    - Comparing the effectiveness of different strategies to mitigate climate change.\n\n5. **Synthesis**:\n    - Combining ideas to develop a comprehensive plan to address climate change.\n    - Integrating sustainable practices into daily life.\n\n6. **Evaluation**:\n    - Justifying the importance of addressing climate change.\n    - Critiquing the effectiveness of current climate change policies.\n\n**Multiple-Choice Questions**:\n\n**Knowledge**\n1) What is the primary cause of polar ice cap melting?\n    - A: Burning fossil fuels\n    - B: Deforestation\n    - C: Rising temperatures\n    - D: Overpopulation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which human activity contributes to greenhouse gas emissions?\n    - A: Recycling\n    - B: Using public transport\n    - C: Burning fossil fuels\n    - D: Planting trees\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension**\n1) What is the relationship between human activities and climate change?\n    - A: Human activities have no impact on climate change.\n    - B: Human activities contribute to climate change.\n    - C: Climate change is solely caused by natural factors.\n    - D: Human activities can only mitigate the effects of climate change.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary impact of climate change on the environment?\n    - A: Loss of biodiversity\n    - B: Rising temperatures and sea-level rise\n    - C: Increased precipitation\n    - D: Improved air quality\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n1) Which of the following is an effective way to reduce carbon footprints?\n    - A: Using energy-efficient appliances\n    - B: Investing in fossil fuels\n    - C: Cutting down trees for urban development\n    - D: Using plastic bags\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is a viable alternative to fossil fuels?\n    - A: Nuclear energy\n    - B: Renewable energy sources\n    - C: Coal\n    - D: Oil\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the primary cause-and-effect connection between human activities and climate change?\n    - A: Burning fossil fuels leads to rising temperatures.\n    - B: Deforestation leads to increased precipitation.\n    - C: Climate change is solely caused by natural factors.\n    - D: Human activities have no impact on climate change.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Which strategy is most effective in mitigating climate change?\n    - A: Reducing energy consumption\n    - B: Investing in renewable energy sources\n    - C: Implementing sustainable land use practices\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) What is a comprehensive plan to address climate change?\n    - A: Reducing energy consumption and investing in renewable energy sources\n    - B: Implementing sustainable land use practices and reducing waste\n    - C: Increasing energy efficiency and adopting sustainable transportation\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How can individuals integrate sustainable practices into daily life?\n    - A: Using public transport and carpooling\n    - B: Reducing energy consumption and using energy-efficient appliances\n    - C: Implementing sustainable land use practices and reducing waste\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) Why is it important to address climate change?\n    - A: Climate change has no significant impact on the environment.\n    - B: Climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention.\n    - C: Climate change is solely caused by natural factors.\n    - D: Climate change is not a global issue.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a critique of current climate change policies?\n    - A: They are effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n    - B: They are inadequate and require more stringent regulations.\n    - C: They are too focused on mitigation rather than adaptation.\n    - D: They are unnecessary and should be abolished.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nPlease provide the actual transcript, and I'll be happy to assist you in creating multiple-choice questions tailored to the content."
