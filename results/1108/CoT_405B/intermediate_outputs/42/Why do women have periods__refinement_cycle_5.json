    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which of the following species are known to experience menstruation?\n    - A: Humans, dogs, and cats\n    - B: Humans, monkeys, apes, bats, and possibly elephant shrews\n    - C: All mammals\n    - D: Only primates\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary function of the placenta during pregnancy?\n    - A: To regulate the mother's blood pressure\n    - B: To connect the fetus to the mother's blood supply and nourish the fetus\n    - C: To produce hormones that increase the mother's blood sugar\n    - D: To support the mother's immune system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the main conflict between the mother and fetus during pregnancy?\n    - A: The mother and fetus have different blood types\n    - B: The fetus wants to extract more resources from the mother than she can afford to give\n    - C: The mother wants to allocate more resources to the fetus, but the fetus is not receiving enough\n    - D: The mother and fetus have identical interests and work together to allocate resources\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why did the endometrium evolve to make implantation difficult?\n    - A: To increase the chances of a successful pregnancy\n    - B: To select for healthy embryos and create an evolutionary feedback loop\n    - C: To reduce the risk of infection\n    - D: To ensure the mother's health and well-being\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is the purpose of menstruation in the human reproductive cycle?\n    - A: To prepare the uterus for pregnancy\n    - B: To remove the endometrial lining and prevent infection\n    - C: To regulate the mother's hormones\n    - D: To nourish the fetus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How does the placenta's role in fetal development contribute to the conflict between the mother and fetus?\n    - A: The placenta helps the mother and fetus work together to allocate resources\n    - B: The placenta allows the fetus to extract resources from the mother, creating a conflict of interests\n    - C: The placenta regulates the mother's blood pressure\n    - D: The placenta produces hormones that increase the mother's blood sugar\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the mother and fetus during pregnancy?\n    - A: The mother and fetus have identical interests and work together to allocate resources\n    - B: The mother and fetus have conflicting interests, with the fetus trying to extract resources from the mother\n    - C: The mother and fetus have different blood types\n    - D: The placenta is not functioning properly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a potential benefit of understanding menstrual cycles as a protective process?\n    - A: Developing more effective birth control methods\n    - B: Improving maternal and fetal health\n    - C: Reducing the risk of infection\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What are the implications of the evolutionary pressures that shape human reproduction for healthcare policy and practice?\n    - A: They have no implications for healthcare policy and practice\n    - B: They suggest that more resources should be allocated to maternal and fetal health\n    - C: They suggest that new reproductive health technologies should be developed\n    - D: They highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between the mother and fetus\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) How does the endometrium's evolution to make implantation difficult contribute to the process of menstruation?\n    - A: It increases the chances of a successful pregnancy\n    - B: It creates an evolutionary feedback loop that selects for healthy embryos\n    - C: It reduces the risk of infection\n    - D: It ensures the mother's health and well-being\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
