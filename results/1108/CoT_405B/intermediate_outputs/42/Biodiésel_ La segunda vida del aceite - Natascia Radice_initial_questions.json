    "initial_questions": "Unfortunately, I cannot create multiple-choice questions without the provided transcript for analysis. However, I can guide you on how to create questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level once the transcript is available.\n\nHere's a general outline of how to create questions for each level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n- Identify specific facts or details in the transcript.\n- Create questions that test recall of these facts.\n- Use phrases like \"What is,\" \"Who said,\" or \"What year\" to begin the questions.\n\nExample (without transcript):\n1) What is the main topic of the discussion?\n    - A: [Topic A]\n    - B: [Topic B]\n    - C: [Topic C]\n    - D: [Topic D]\n[Correct answer]: [Correct topic]\n\n**Comprehension**\n- Summarize important concepts in the transcript.\n- Create questions that assess understanding of these concepts.\n- Use phrases like \"What does this mean,\" \"Can you describe,\" or \"How does this work\" to begin the questions.\n\nExample (without transcript):\n1) What does the concept of [concept] mean in this context?\n    - A: [Definition A]\n    - B: [Definition B]\n    - C: [Definition C]\n    - D: [Definition D]\n[Correct answer]: [Correct definition]\n\n**Application**\n- Describe scenarios or real-world applications in the transcript.\n- Create questions that present scenarios requiring application of the information.\n- Use phrases like \"How would you,\" \"What would happen if,\" or \"Can you apply\" to begin the questions.\n\nExample (without transcript):\n1) How would you apply [concept] to a real-world scenario?\n    - A: [Application A]\n    - B: [Application B]\n    - C: [Application C]\n    - D: [Application D]\n[Correct answer]: [Correct application]\n\n**Analysis**\n- Identify relationships, contrasts, or cause-and-effect connections in the transcript.\n- Create questions that require breaking down or examining information.\n- Use phrases like \"Can you compare,\" \"How does this relate,\" or \"What is the cause of\" to begin the questions.\n\nExample (without transcript):\n1) Can you compare and contrast [concept A] and [concept B]?\n    - A: [Comparison A]\n    - B: [Comparison B]\n    - C: [Comparison C]\n    - D: [Comparison D]\n[Correct answer]: [Correct comparison]\n\n**Synthesis**\n- Provide insights where ideas could be combined to form new understanding in the transcript.\n- Create questions that require combining ideas or creating new insights.\n- Use phrases like \"Can you create,\" \"How would you design,\" or \"What would happen if you combined\" to begin the questions.\n\nExample (without transcript):\n1) Can you create a new solution by combining [concept A] and [concept B]?\n    - A: [Solution A]\n    - B: [Solution B]\n    - C: [Solution C]\n    - D: [Solution D]\n[Correct answer]: [Correct solution]\n\n**Evaluation**\n- List parts of the transcript where judgment, critique, or justification would be appropriate.\n- Create questions that require judgment or justification.\n- Use phrases like \"Do you agree,\" \"Can you justify,\" or \"What is your opinion\" to begin the questions.\n\nExample (without transcript):\n1) Do you agree with the statement [statement]?\n    - A: [Agree]\n    - B: [Disagree]\n    - C: [Neutral]\n    - D: [Undecided]\n[Correct answer]: [Correct evaluation]\n\nPlease provide the transcript, and I will assist you in creating multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level."
