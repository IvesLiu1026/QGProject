    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of mucus is composed of water?\n    - A: 60%\n    - B: 70%\n    - C: 80%\n    - D: 90%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What causes the greenish color of mucus associated with infections?\n    - A: An enzyme produced by red blood cells\n    - B: An enzyme produced by white blood cells\n    - C: The presence of bacteria\n    - D: The presence of viruses\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What are the primary functions of mucus in the body?\n    - A: To produce antibodies and regulate body temperature\n    - B: To neutralize threats, protect delicate tissues, lubricate the eyes, and maintain a healthy microbiota\n    - C: To break down food in the stomach and regulate pH levels\n    - D: To facilitate the exchange of gases in the lungs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the primary role of mucins in mucus?\n    - A: To provide nutrients to the body's microbiota\n    - B: To create a complex network that establishes a barrier against pathogens, maintain hydration, and give mucus its slippery feel\n    - C: To regulate the body's pH levels\n    - D: To facilitate the movement of substances across cell membranes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How does mucus protect the body against infection?\n    - A: By suppressing the immune system\n    - B: By neutralizing threats, trapping substances that could make you sick, preventing biofilm formation, and housing beneficial bacteria\n    - C: By producing antibodies against infections only\n    - D: By regulating body temperature\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the relationship between mucus and the body's microbiota?\n    - A: Mucus helps to eliminate the body's microbiota\n    - B: Mucus has no effect on the body's microbiota\n    - C: Mucus helps to regulate the growth of the body's microbiota, maintain a healthy balance, and house beneficial bacteria\n    - D: Mucus provides nutrients to the body's microbiota only\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How do the hydrophilic sugar chains in mucins contribute to the ability of mucus to stay hydrated?\n    - A: The sugar chains make mucus more viscous and less hydrated\n    - B: The sugar chains have no effect on mucus hydration\n    - C: The sugar chains help mucus dissolve in the body's watery fluids and maintain hydration\n    - D: The sugar chains make mucus more prone to infection\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the role of mucus in the respiratory tract?\n    - A: To produce antibodies against infections\n    - B: To neutralize threats and protect delicate tissues\n    - C: To clear pathogens and other invaders from the respiratory tract, like a slimy conveyor belt, and prevent biofilm formation\n    - D: To facilitate the exchange of gases in the lungs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How does understanding the role of mucus in the body contribute to our understanding of human health?\n    - A: It highlights the importance of suppressing mucus production\n    - B: It reveals the role of mucus in regulating body temperature\n    - C: It demonstrates the importance of mucus in protecting against infection, maintaining a healthy microbiota, and overall health\n    - D: It shows that mucus has no effect on overall health\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can happen if the body's microbiota becomes imbalanced?\n    - A: The immune system is boosted\n    - B: The body becomes more resistant to infection\n    - C: A range of health problems can occur, including increased susceptibility to infection\n    - D: There is no effect on overall health\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 11-20 as they were duplicates of the first 10 questions. The refined questions are clear, concise, and align with the key concepts in the transcript. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. No further refinement is necessary."
