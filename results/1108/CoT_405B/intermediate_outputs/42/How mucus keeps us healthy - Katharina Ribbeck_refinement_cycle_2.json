    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) What percentage of mucus is composed of water?\n    - A: 50%\n    - B: 70%\n    - C: 80%\n    - D: 90%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is responsible for the greenish color of mucus associated with infections?\n    - A: An enzyme produced by red blood cells\n    - B: An enzyme produced by white blood cells\n    - C: The presence of bacteria\n    - D: The presence of viruses\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is one of the primary roles of mucus in the body?\n    - A: To produce antibodies against infections\n    - B: To neutralize threats and protect delicate tissues\n    - C: To break down food in the stomach\n    - D: To regulate body temperature\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the primary function of mucins in mucus?\n    - A: To provide nutrients to the body's microbiota\n    - B: To create a complex network that establishes a barrier against pathogens\n    - C: To lubricate the eyes and other mucus membranes\n    - D: To regulate the body's pH levels\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How does mucus help protect the body against infection?\n    - A: By suppressing the immune system\n    - B: By neutralizing threats and trapping substances that could make you sick\n    - C: By producing antibodies against infections\n    - D: By regulating body temperature\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the relationship between mucus and the body's microbiota?\n    - A: Mucus helps to eliminate the body's microbiota\n    - B: Mucus has no effect on the body's microbiota\n    - C: Mucus helps to regulate the growth of the body's microbiota\n    - D: Mucus provides nutrients to the body's microbiota\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How do the hydrophilic sugar chains in mucins contribute to the ability of mucus to stay hydrated?\n    - A: The sugar chains make mucus more viscous and less hydrated\n    - B: The sugar chains have no effect on mucus hydration\n    - C: The sugar chains help mucus dissolve in the body's watery fluids\n    - D: The sugar chains make mucus more prone to infection\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the role of mucus in the respiratory tract?\n    - A: To produce antibodies against infections\n    - B: To neutralize threats and protect delicate tissues\n    - C: To clear pathogens and other invaders from the respiratory tract\n    - D: To regulate body temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How does understanding the role of mucus in the body contribute to our understanding of human health?\n    - A: It highlights the importance of suppressing mucus production\n    - B: It reveals the role of mucus in regulating body temperature\n    - C: It demonstrates the importance of mucus in protecting against infection and maintaining a healthy microbiota\n    - D: It shows that mucus has no effect on overall health\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can happen if the body's microbiota becomes imbalanced?\n    - A: The immune system is boosted\n    - B: The body becomes more resistant to infection\n    - C: A range of health problems can occur\n    - D: There is no effect on overall health\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were redundant, and questions 5, 9, and 10 from the initial set were revised to better align with the key concepts and ensure clarity and conciseness."
