Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary cause of the enhanced greenhouse effect?\n    - A: Burning of fossil fuels\n    - B: Deforestation\n    - C: Ozone layer depletion\n    - D: Overpopulation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Which of the following gases is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere?\n    - A: Carbon dioxide\n    - B: Methane\n    - C: Nitrous oxide\n    - D: Water vapor\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is the main difference between climate change and global warming?\n    - A: Climate change refers to rising temperatures, while global warming refers to changing weather patterns.\n    - B: Climate change refers to changing weather patterns and global conditions, while global warming refers specifically to rising temperatures.\n    - C: Climate change is a natural phenomenon, while global warming is caused by human activities.\n    - D: Climate change is a short-term process, while global warming is a long-term process.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Which of the following statements best describes the concept of climate sensitivity?\n    - A: The amount of warming that occurs in response to a given increase in greenhouse gas emissions.\n    - B: The rate at which the Earth's climate is changing.\n    - C: The impact of climate change on global food production.\n    - D: The effect of climate change on sea levels.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) What environmental factor should a company consider when evaluating the potential impact of a new wind farm on reducing its carbon footprint?\n    - A: Cost-benefit analysis\n    - B: Location and visual impact\n    - C: Energy production capacity\n    - D: Potential impact on local wildlife and ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) A city is experiencing frequent flooding due to rising sea levels. What adaptation strategy could they implement to mitigate the effects of flooding?\n    - A: Building sea walls to protect the city\n    - B: Implementing a flood warning system\n    - C: Relocating residents to higher ground\n    - D: Increasing the city's stormwater drainage capacity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the Earth's average temperature?\n    - A: As carbon dioxide concentrations increase, the Earth's average temperature decreases.\n    - B: As carbon dioxide concentrations increase, the Earth's average temperature remains constant.\n    - C: As carbon dioxide concentrations increase, the Earth's average temperature increases.\n    - D: There is no relationship between carbon dioxide concentrations and the Earth's average temperature.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) Which of the following factors contributes to the uncertainty in climate change projections?\n    - A: The complexity of the Earth's climate system\n    - B: The accuracy of climate models\n    - C: The availability of climate data\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) How could a combination of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector?\n    - A: By powering electric vehicles with renewable energy\n    - B: By increasing the efficiency of internal combustion engines\n    - C: By promoting the use of public transportation\n    - D: By investing in carbon capture and storage technology\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What potential benefits could arise from implementing a global carbon pricing mechanism?\n    - A: Reduced greenhouse gas emissions and increased economic growth\n    - B: Increased greenhouse gas emissions and reduced economic growth\n    - C: Reduced greenhouse gas emissions and reduced economic growth\n    - D: Increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased economic growth\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What are the ethical implications of climate change for future generations?\n    - A: Climate change will have no impact on future generations.\n    - B: Climate change will have a positive impact on future generations.\n    - C: Climate change will have a negative impact on future generations, but it is not our responsibility to address it.\n    - D: Climate change will have a negative impact on future generations, and it is our moral obligation to take action to mitigate its effects.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) Which of the following statements is a valid critique of the current international climate change mitigation efforts?\n    - A: The efforts are too ambitious and will harm the global economy.\n    - B: The efforts are not ambitious enough and will not effectively address the problem.\n    - C: The efforts are well-intentioned but lack a clear implementation plan.\n    - D: The efforts are unnecessary because climate change is not a real problem.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nWithout specific feedback, these questions seem clear and concise, with plausible distractors and accurate correct answers. However, I would like to emphasize that reviewing the transcript and incorporating specific feedback would be essential for further refinement."
