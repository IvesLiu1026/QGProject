    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) Which of the following species are known to experience menstruation?\n    - A: Humans, dogs, and cats\n    - B: Humans, monkeys, apes, bats, and possibly elephant shrews\n    - C: All mammals\n    - D: Only primates\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary function of the placenta during pregnancy?\n    - A: To regulate the mother's blood pressure\n    - B: To connect the fetus to the mother's blood supply and nourish the fetus\n    - C: To produce hormones that increase the mother's blood sugar\n    - D: To support the mother's immune system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the main conflict between the mother and fetus during pregnancy?\n    - A: The mother and fetus have different blood types\n    - B: The fetus wants to extract more resources from the mother than she can afford to give\n    - C: The mother wants to allocate more resources to the fetus, but the fetus is not receiving enough\n    - D: The mother and fetus have identical interests and work together to allocate resources\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why did the endometrium evolve to make implantation difficult?\n    - A: To increase the chances of a successful pregnancy\n    - B: To select for healthy embryos and create an evolutionary feedback loop\n    - C: To reduce the risk of infection\n    - D: To make childbirth easier\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential consequence of the endometrium's evolution to make implantation difficult?\n    - A: The placenta becomes less effective at nourishing the fetus\n    - B: Menstruation is a consequence of this feedback loop, as the body seeks to avoid the risks associated with a failed pregnancy\n    - C: The mother's blood pressure increases\n    - D: The fetus produces more hormones to increase the mother's blood sugar\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How does the concept of menstrual cycles as a protective process relate to the placenta's role in fetal development?\n    - A: The placenta plays a crucial role in the conflict between the mother and fetus\n    - B: The endometrium's evolution to make implantation difficult has created an evolutionary feedback loop\n    - C: Menstruation is a process that supports the placenta's function\n    - D: The placenta is not involved in the menstrual cycle\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between the mother and fetus during pregnancy?\n    - A: The mother and fetus have identical interests and work together to allocate resources\n    - B: The mother and fetus have conflicting interests, with the fetus trying to extract resources from the mother\n    - C: The mother and fetus have different blood types\n    - D: The placenta is not functioning properly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a potential benefit of understanding menstrual cycles as a protective process?\n    - A: Developing more effective birth control methods\n    - B: Improving maternal and fetal health\n    - C: Reducing the risk of infection\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What are the implications of the evolutionary pressures that shape human reproduction for healthcare policy and practice?\n    - A: They have no implications for healthcare policy and practice\n    - B: They suggest that more resources should be allocated to maternal and fetal health\n    - C: They suggest that new reproductive health technologies should be developed\n    - D: They highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between the mother and fetus\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is the primary purpose of menstruation in the human reproductive cycle?\n    - A: To prepare the uterus for pregnancy\n    - B: To remove the endometrial lining and prevent infection\n    - C: To regulate the mother's hormones\n    - D: To nourish the fetus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made minor changes to questions 1-9 to improve clarity and concision. I replaced question 10 with a new one that focuses on the primary purpose of menstruation, which is to remove the endometrial lining and prevent infection. This new question aligns with the key concepts in the transcript and has plausible but incorrect distractors."
