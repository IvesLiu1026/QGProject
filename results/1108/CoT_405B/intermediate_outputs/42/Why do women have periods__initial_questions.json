    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) Which of the following species experience menstruation?\n    - A: Humans, dogs, and cats\n    - B: Humans, monkeys, apes, bats, and possibly elephant shrews\n    - C: All mammals\n    - D: Only primates\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary function of the placenta during pregnancy?\n    - A: To produce hormones that increase the mother's blood sugar\n    - B: To connect the fetus to the mother's blood supply and nourish the fetus\n    - C: To regulate the mother's blood pressure\n    - D: To remove the endometrial lining of the uterus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What is the main conflict between the mother and fetus during pregnancy?\n    - A: The mother wants to allocate more resources to the fetus, but the fetus is not receiving enough\n    - B: The fetus wants to extract more resources from the mother than she can afford to give\n    - C: The mother and fetus have different blood types\n    - D: The placenta is not functioning properly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the evolutionary purpose of the endometrium making implantation difficult?\n    - A: To increase the chances of a successful pregnancy\n    - B: To select for healthy embryos and create an evolutionary feedback loop\n    - C: To reduce the risk of infection\n    - D: To make childbirth easier\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) How can understanding the evolutionary pressures that shape human reproduction inform healthcare strategies?\n    - A: By developing more effective treatments for pregnancy-related complications\n    - B: By improving maternal and fetal health through more effective resource allocation\n    - C: By creating new reproductive health technologies\n    - D: By reducing the risk of infection\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a potential application of the concept of menstrual cycles as a protective process?\n    - A: Developing more effective birth control methods\n    - B: Improving maternal and fetal health\n    - C: Reducing the risk of infection\n    - D: Creating new reproductive health technologies\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the mother and fetus during pregnancy?\n    - A: The mother and fetus have identical interests and work together to allocate resources\n    - B: The mother and fetus have conflicting interests, with the fetus trying to extract resources from the mother\n    - C: The mother and fetus have different blood types\n    - D: The placenta is not functioning properly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the consequence of the endometrium's evolution to make implantation difficult?\n    - A: Menstruation is a consequence of this feedback loop, as the body seeks to avoid the risks associated with a failed pregnancy\n    - B: The placenta becomes less effective at nourishing the fetus\n    - C: The mother's blood pressure increases\n    - D: The fetus produces more hormones to increase the mother's blood sugar\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How can the concept of menstrual cycles as a protective process be integrated with our understanding of the placenta's role in fetal development?\n    - A: By recognizing that the placenta plays a crucial role in the conflict between the mother and fetus\n    - B: By understanding that the endometrium's evolution to make implantation difficult has created an evolutionary feedback loop\n    - C: By developing new reproductive health technologies\n    - D: By improving maternal and fetal health through more effective resource allocation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is a potential outcome of combining insights from evolutionary biology with the study of human reproduction?\n    - A: A better understanding of the conservation of other species that experience menstruation\n    - B: The development of new reproductive health technologies\n    - C: Improved maternal and fetal health\n    - D: A greater understanding of the placenta's role in fetal development\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) Is the concept of menstrual cycles as a protective process supported by empirical evidence?\n    - A: Yes, it is supported by a large body of empirical evidence\n    - B: No, it is a theoretical framework that requires further testing\n    - C: It is supported by some empirical evidence, but more research is needed\n    - D: It is not supported by empirical evidence and is likely incorrect\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What are the implications of the evolutionary pressures that shape human reproduction for healthcare policy and practice?\n    - A: They have no implications for healthcare policy and practice\n    - B: They suggest that more resources should be allocated to maternal and fetal health\n    - C: They suggest that new reproductive health technologies should be developed\n    - D: They highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between the mother and fetus\n[Correct answer]: D"
