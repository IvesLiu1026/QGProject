    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which of the following species are known to experience menstruation?\n    - A: Humans, dogs, and cats\n    - B: Humans, monkeys, apes, bats, and possibly elephant shrews\n    - C: All mammals\n    - D: Only primates\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary function of the placenta during pregnancy?\n    - A: To regulate the mother's blood pressure\n    - B: To connect the fetus to the mother's blood supply and nourish the fetus\n    - C: To produce hormones that increase the mother's blood sugar\n    - D: To remove the endometrial lining of the uterus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the main conflict between the mother and fetus during pregnancy?\n    - A: The mother and fetus have different blood types\n    - B: The fetus wants to extract more resources from the mother than she can afford to give\n    - C: The mother wants to allocate more resources to the fetus, but the fetus is not receiving enough\n    - D: The mother and fetus have identical interests and work together to allocate resources\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why did the endometrium evolve to make implantation difficult?\n    - A: To increase the chances of a successful pregnancy\n    - B: To select for healthy embryos and create an evolutionary feedback loop\n    - C: To reduce the risk of infection\n    - D: To make childbirth easier\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential consequence of the endometrium's evolution to make implantation difficult?\n    - A: The placenta becomes less effective at nourishing the fetus\n    - B: Menstruation is a consequence of this feedback loop, as the body seeks to avoid the risks associated with a failed pregnancy\n    - C: The mother's blood pressure increases\n    - D: The fetus produces more hormones to increase the mother's blood sugar\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How does the concept of menstrual cycles as a protective process relate to the placenta's role in fetal development?\n    - A: The placenta plays a crucial role in the conflict between the mother and fetus\n    - B: The endometrium's evolution to make implantation difficult has created an evolutionary feedback loop\n    - C: Menstruation is a process that supports the placenta's function\n    - D: The placenta is not involved in the menstrual cycle\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between the mother and fetus during pregnancy?\n    - A: The mother and fetus have identical interests and work together to allocate resources\n    - B: The mother and fetus have conflicting interests, with the fetus trying to extract resources from the mother\n    - C: The mother and fetus have different blood types\n    - D: The placenta is not functioning properly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a potential benefit of understanding menstrual cycles as a protective process?\n    - A: Developing more effective birth control methods\n    - B: Improving maternal and fetal health\n    - C: Reducing the risk of infection\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What are the implications of the evolutionary pressures that shape human reproduction for healthcare policy and practice?\n    - A: They have no implications for healthcare policy and practice\n    - B: They suggest that more resources should be allocated to maternal and fetal health\n    - C: They suggest that new reproductive health technologies should be developed\n    - D: They highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between the mother and fetus\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is the current state of empirical evidence supporting the concept of menstrual cycles as a protective process?\n    - A: It is supported by a large body of empirical evidence\n    - B: It is a theoretical framework that requires further testing\n    - C: It is supported by some empirical evidence, but more research is needed\n    - D: It is not supported by empirical evidence and is likely incorrect\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-7. Questions 8-10 were refined to improve clarity and concision."
