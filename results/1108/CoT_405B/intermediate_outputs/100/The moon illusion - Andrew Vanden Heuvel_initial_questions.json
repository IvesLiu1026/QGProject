A: The brain perceives objects near the horizon as larger due to perspective.\n    - B: The relative size of surrounding objects makes the moon appear larger.\n    - C: The Earth's atmosphere acts as a giant lens to magnify the moon.\n    - D: The moon's actual size changes when it is near the horizon.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What does Convergence Micropsia explain about the moon illusion?\n    - A: Why the moon appears larger near the horizon.\n    - B: Why the moon appears smaller when overhead.\n    - C: Why the moon's size appears to change throughout the day.\n    - D: Why the moon illusion disappears when viewed between the legs.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-world Scenarios)**\n\n1) Who can still experience the moon illusion even when there are no smaller objects near the horizon?\n    - A: Only astronomers and physicists\n    - B: Pilots and sailors\n    - C: Only people with perfect vision\n    - D: Only people who have studied the moon illusion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Where is the moon illusion not visible?\n    - A: In a planetarium\n    - B: On a clear night\n    - C: Near the equator\n    - D: At high altitudes\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, Contrasts, Cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the Ebbinghaus Illusion and the moon illusion?\n    - A: The Ebbinghaus Illusion explains why the moon appears smaller when overhead.\n    - B: The Ebbinghaus Illusion is unrelated to the moon illusion.\n    - C: The relative size of surrounding objects may contribute to the illusion.\n    - D: The Ebbinghaus Illusion is the sole explanation for the moon illusion.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the contrast between the Ponzo Illusion and Convergence Micropsia?\n    - A: The Ponzo Illusion explains why the moon appears smaller when overhead, while Convergence Micropsia explains why it appears larger near the horizon.\n    - B: The Ponzo Illusion explains why the moon appears larger near the horizon, while Convergence Micropsia explains why it appears smaller when overhead.\n    - C: The Ponzo Illusion and Convergence Micropsia explain the same aspect of the moon illusion.\n    - D: The Ponzo Illusion and Convergence Micropsia are unrelated to the moon illusion.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1) What is a possible explanation for the moon illusion, combining the Ebbinghaus Illusion and Ponzo Illusion?\n    - A: The moon illusion is the result of a combination of factors, including the relative size of surrounding objects and the brain's perception of perspective.\n    - B: The moon illusion is solely the result of the relative size of surrounding objects.\n    - C: The moon illusion is solely the result of the brain's perception of perspective.\n    - D: The moon illusion is unrelated to the Ebbinghaus Illusion and Ponzo Illusion.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is a possible consideration when evaluating the moon illusion, taking into account Convergence Micropsia?\n    - A: The moon illusion is only about the moon appearing larger near the horizon.\n    - B: The moon illusion is not just about the moon appearing larger near the horizon, but also about the brain's perception of distance and size.\n    - C: The moon illusion is solely about the brain's perception of distance.\n    - D: The moon illusion is solely about the brain's perception of size.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, Critique, Justification)**\n\n1) What can be concluded about the effectiveness of the Ebbinghaus Illusion and Ponzo Illusion in explaining the moon illusion?\n    - A: They are sufficient to fully explain the phenomenon.\n    - B: They are not sufficient to fully explain the phenomenon.\n    - C: They are unrelated to the moon illusion.\n    - D: They are the only explanations for the moon illusion.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a possible critique of the Convergence Micropsia explanation for the moon illusion?\n    - A: It is a complete explanation for the moon illusion.\n    - B: It is not a complete explanation, as it does not account for all aspects of the moon illusion.\n    - C: It is unrelated to the moon illusion.\n    - D: It is the only explanation for the moon illusion.\n[Correct answer]: B"
