    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary geographical difference between the Arctic and Antarctic regions?\n    - A: The Arctic is a continent, and the Antarctic is an ocean.\n    - B: The Arctic is an ocean entirely surrounded by land, and the Antarctic is a continent entirely surrounded by ocean.\n    - C: The Arctic has a larger landmass than the Antarctic.\n    - D: The Arctic and Antarctic have similar geographical features.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the approximate depth of the water at the North Pole?\n    - A: 10,000 feet\n    - B: 12,000 feet\n    - C: 13,980 feet\n    - D: 15,000 feet\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why is Antarctica considered a desert?\n    - A: It has a high average elevation.\n    - B: It receives heavy rainfall throughout the year.\n    - C: It has a cold and windy climate.\n    - D: It receives very little precipitation annually, with an average of 200 millimeters along the coast.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What are the primary reasons why Antarctica is colder than the Arctic?\n    - A: The Arctic is closer to the equator, and the Antarctic receives more sunlight during the summer months.\n    - B: The Antarctic is at a higher elevation, the Arctic is a frozen ocean with warmer water beneath, and the Earth's distance from the Sun during Antarctic winter contributes to the cold temperatures.\n    - C: The Antarctic has a thicker ice pack, and the Arctic has a more temperate climate.\n    - D: The Antarctic's dry climate and lack of precipitation contribute to its colder temperatures.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is the significance of the polar regions in terms of climate control?\n    - A: They have no impact on global climate.\n    - B: They help moderate temperatures in temperate zones and provide stable weather.\n    - C: They are responsible for extreme weather patterns.\n    - D: They only affect the climate in the polar regions.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo major changes were made to the questions, but some distractors were adjusted to make them more plausible but incorrect. The correct answers remain the same."
