    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge** (Specific facts or details that can be recalled directly):\n1. Conjunctions are words that connect clauses, words, and phrases.\n2. The acronym FANBOYS stands for for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so.\n3. Subordinates connect two unequal things, dependent and independent clauses.\n4. Commonly used subordinates are although, because, before, however, unless, and even though.\n5. A comma is used to help subordinates balance sentences when the weight is not evenly distributed.\n6. When subordinates begin sentences, the comma is placed directly after the first thought or complete sentence.\n7. A comma is placed before a conjunction (FANBOYS) when connecting two complete sentences.\n\n**Comprehension** (Important concepts that require understanding or interpretation):\n1. Conjunctions and subordinates have different roles in sentence construction.\n2. The \"weight\" of sentences can be balanced using commas.\n3. The placement of commas depends on the type of word (conjunction or subordinate) and the sentence structure.\n4. Simple physics can be applied to understand how commas help balance sentence weight.\n\n**Application** (Scenarios or real-world applications where the content can be applied):\n1. Using commas correctly in sentences with conjunctions and subordinates.\n2. Applying the FANBOYS acronym to remember conjunctions.\n3. Identifying when a comma is needed to balance sentence weight.\n4. Writing sentences with subordinates and conjunctions, using commas correctly.\n\n**Analysis** (Relationships, contrasts, or cause-and-effect connections in the content):\n1. The relationship between conjunctions and subordinates in sentence construction.\n2. The contrast between the roles of conjunctions and subordinates.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the placement of commas and the balance of sentence weight.\n4. The effect of using commas correctly on the clarity and meaning of sentences.\n\n**Synthesis** (Combining ideas to form new understanding):\n1. Combining the concepts of conjunctions, subordinates, and commas to create effective sentence structures.\n2. Applying the idea of \"weight\" and balance to sentence construction.\n3. Using the FANBOYS acronym and the concept of subordinates to create a system for remembering comma placement.\n\n**Evaluation** (Judgment, critique, or justification):\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of using commas to balance sentence weight.\n2. Critiquing sentences for correct comma placement.\n3. Justifying the use of commas in specific sentence structures.\n4. Judging the clarity and meaning of sentences based on comma placement."
