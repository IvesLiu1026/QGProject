A: By recognizing that the body absorbs nutrients from food as whole molecules\n    - B: By understanding that the body breaks down complex molecules into simpler components, which are then utilized for energy and growth\n    - C: By identifying the different types of nutrients in food and their functions in the body\n    - D: By analyzing the chemical reactions involved in digestion and nutrient absorption\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the broader implication of the constant flux and change of materials?\n    - A: The constant flux and change of materials implies that materials are static and unchangeable\n    - B: The constant flux and change of materials implies that materials can be transformed and reused, reducing waste and conserving resources\n    - C: The constant flux and change of materials implies that materials are constantly being created and destroyed\n    - D: The constant flux and change of materials implies that materials are only useful for a limited time\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Why is it significant to understand the molecular composition of everyday objects and substances?\n    - A: It is not significant, as it does not impact our daily lives\n    - B: It is significant, as it allows us to understand the properties and behaviors of materials\n    - C: It is significant, as it enables us to identify the different types of nutrients in food\n    - D: It is significant, as it helps us understand how to cook food properly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the importance of digestion in maintaining human health and well-being?\n    - A: Digestion is not important, as the body can absorb nutrients from food without it\n    - B: Digestion is important, as it allows the body to break down complex molecules into usable components\n    - C: Digestion is important, as it enables the body to identify the different types of nutrients in food\n    -
