    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which brain region is involved in updating impressions based on people's behaviors, particularly in tracking the frequency of those behaviors?\n    - A: Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\n    - B: Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex\n    - C: Anterior cingulate cortex\n    - D: Medial prefrontal cortex\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What type of information typically has a stronger impact on impression updating, especially when it comes to moral character?\n    - A: Neutral information\n    - B: Very positive, highly moral information\n    - C: Very negative, highly immoral information\n    - D: Inconsistent information\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) According to research in social psychology, why do people tend to form impressions quickly?\n    - A: To avoid social interactions\n    - B: To remember past interactions\n    - C: To predict future behavior and make sense of others' actions\n    - D: To ignore others' behaviors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What bias occurs when learning about abilities and competencies, such as a person's skills or talents?\n    - A: Negativity bias\n    - B: Positivity bias\n    - C: Confirmation bias\n    - D: Anchoring bias\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) You meet someone new and they seem friendly, but later you learn that they have a history of dishonest behavior. What is likely to happen to your impression of them?\n    - A: It will become more positive\n    - B: It will remain the same\n    - C: It will become more nuanced\n    - D: It will become more negative\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) A colleague is known for their exceptional work ethic, but you recently learned that they have been struggling with a project. How might this new information affect your impression of them?\n    - A: It will reinforce your positive impression\n    - B: It will create a negative impression\n    - C: It will lead to a more nuanced understanding of their abilities\n    - D: It will have no impact on your impression\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How does the brain's tracking of statistical properties, such as the frequency of behaviors, relate to complex decision-making about others' character?\n    - A: The brain's tracking of statistical properties leads to simplistic decision-making\n    - B: The brain's tracking of statistical properties has no impact on decision-making\n    - C: The brain's tracking of statistical properties leads to more accurate judgments\n    - D: The brain's tracking of statistical properties leads to complex decision-making\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) How do biases, such as the negativity bias, influence impression updating?\n    - A: Biases lead to more accurate judgments\n    - B: Biases have no impact on impression updating\n    - C: Biases lead to less accurate judgments\n    - D: Biases are irrelevant to impression updating\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can understanding impression updating inform strategies for improving social cognition and reducing biases?\n    - A: By ignoring new information that contradicts initial impressions\n    - B: By seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences\n    - C: By relying solely on initial impressions\n    - D: By avoiding social interactions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What are the implications of the research on impression updating for personal relationships and social interactions?\n    - A: The research suggests that people should trust their initial impressions\n    - B: The research suggests that people should be cautious of biases in impression updating\n    - C: The research suggests that people should ignore others' behaviors\n    - D: The research suggests that people should only focus on positive information\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a potential limitation of the research on impression updating?\n    - A: The studies relied on self-report measures\n    - B: The studies used a diverse range of participants\n    - C: The studies controlled for extraneous variables\n    - D: The studies used a longitudinal design\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) Why is understanding impression updating important in social psychology?\n    - A: It helps us understand how people form impressions of inanimate objects\n    - B: It helps us understand how people form impressions of others and make sense of their behaviors\n    - C: It helps us understand how people make decisions about financial investments\n    - D: It helps us understand how people develop language skills\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12."
