    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What does the term \"déjà vu\" literally translate to in English?\n    - A: \"Already experienced\"\n    - B: \"Already seen\"\n    - C: \"Familiar feeling\"\n    - D: \"Memory recall\"\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Who is credited with introducing the term \"déjà vu\"?\n    - A: Sigmund Freud\n    - B: Emile Boirac\n    - C: Jean-Paul Sartre\n    - D: Albert Einstein\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary challenge in studying déjà vu?\n    - A: It is a rare occurrence\n    - B: It is a brief experience that occurs without notice\n    - C: It is a physical manifestation\n    - D: It is a predictable phenomenon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) According to the hologram theory, how are memories stored in the brain?\n    - A: As electrical impulses\n    - B: As chemical reactions\n    - C: As holograms\n    - D: As sound waves\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) According to the divided attention theory, what can contribute to the occurrence of déjà vu?\n    - A: Paying attention to one's surroundings\n    - B: Focusing on a single task\n    - C: Multitasking\n    - D: Distracting oneself from the environment\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What can understanding the theories of déjà vu help individuals do?\n    - A: Predict when déjà vu will occur\n    - B: Control the frequency of déjà vu\n    - C: Better understand their own experiences of déjà vu\n    - D: Eliminate déjà vu entirely\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) According to the dual processing theory, what can cause déjà vu?\n    - A: Simultaneous processing of information by the brain's hemispheres\n    - B: Linear processing of information by the brain's hemispheres\n    - C: A delay in information processing between the brain's hemispheres\n    - D: A lack of communication between the brain's hemispheres\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What does the hologram theory suggest is an important factor in déjà vu?\n    - A: Attention and awareness\n    - B: Memory and its influence on experiences\n    - C: The role of emotions in déjà vu\n    - D: The impact of environment on déjà vu\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be inferred by combining the dual processing and hologram theories?\n    - A: Déjà vu occurs when there is a delay in information processing and a fragment of a memory is triggered without being identified\n    - B: Déjà vu occurs when there is a lack of attention and awareness\n    - C: Déjà vu occurs when there is a failure in memory recall\n    - D: Déjà vu occurs when there is a misfire in the brain's hemispheres\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can be suggested by combining the divided attention theory with the dual processing theory?\n    - A: Distractions can cause a delay in information processing, leading to déjà vu\n    - B: Focusing on a single task can eliminate déjà vu\n    - C: Multitasking can increase the frequency of déjà vu\n    - D: Daydreaming can reduce the occurrence of déjà vu\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is necessary to make informed judgments about the validity of each theory of déjà vu?\n    - A: Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each theory\n    - B: Evaluating the evidence supporting each theory\n    - C: Considering the limitations of each theory\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is important to recognize when evaluating the implications of each theory?\n    - A: The potential for reducing the occurrence of déjà vu\n    - B: The potential for increasing the frequency of déjà vu\n    - C: The potential for eliminating déjà vu entirely\n    - D: The potential for understanding the underlying mechanisms of déjà vu\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made minor changes to the questions to enhance clarity and conciseness, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also reviewed the correct answers to ensure their accuracy. No major changes were necessary, as the initial questions were well-aligned with the key concepts in the transcript."
