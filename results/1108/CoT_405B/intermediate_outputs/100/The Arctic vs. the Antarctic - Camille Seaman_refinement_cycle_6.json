    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions as follows:\n\n1) What primary geographical feature distinguishes the Arctic from the Antarctic region?\n    - A: The Arctic is a continent, and the Antarctic is an ocean.\n    - B: The Arctic is an ocean entirely surrounded by land, and the Antarctic is a continent entirely surrounded by ocean.\n    - C: The Arctic has a larger landmass than the Antarctic.\n    - D: The Arctic and Antarctic have similar geographical features.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the approximate depth of the water at the North Pole?\n    - A: 10,000 feet\n    - B: 12,000 feet\n    - C: 13,980 feet\n    - D: 15,000 feet\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why is Antarctica classified as a desert?\n    - A: It has a high average elevation.\n    - B: It receives heavy rainfall throughout the year.\n    - C: It has a cold and windy climate.\n    - D: It receives very little precipitation annually, with an average of 200 millimeters along the coast.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What are the primary reasons why Antarctica is colder than the Arctic?\n    - A: The Arctic is closer to the equator, and the Antarctic receives more sunlight during the summer months.\n    - B: The Antarctic is at a higher elevation, the Arctic is a frozen ocean with warmer water beneath, and the Earth's distance from the Sun during Antarctic winter contributes to the cold temperatures.\n    - C: The Antarctic has a thicker ice pack, and the Arctic has a more temperate climate.\n    - D: The Antarctic's dry climate and lack of precipitation contribute to its colder temperatures.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What role do the polar regions play in terms of climate control?\n    - A: They have no impact on global climate.\n    - B: They help moderate temperatures in temperate zones and provide stable weather.\n    - C: They are responsible for extreme weather patterns.\n    - D: They only affect the climate in the polar regions.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nAfter reviewing the questions and the transcript, I believe that the questions accurately reflect the key concepts and information provided. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. Therefore, I do not recommend any further refinement.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
