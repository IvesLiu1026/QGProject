    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which category of elements does samarium belong to?\n    - A: Actinides\n    - B: Alkali metals\n    - C: Lanthanides\n    - D: Transition metals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What gas is used to pack the samarium sample to prevent reaction?\n    - A: Oxygen\n    - B: Nitrogen\n    - C: Helium\n    - D: Argon\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What property of samarium makes it useful in chemistry?\n    - A: High melting point\n    - B: Ability to change oxidation states easily\n    - C: High reactivity with water\n    - D: Low atomic mass\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why is argon used to store the samarium sample?\n    - A: Because it is highly reactive\n    - B: Due to its high atomic mass\n    - C: As a result of its inert nature\n    - D: Since it is a diatomic gas\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) Which element can be used to date a sample from the moon?\n    - A: Uranium\n    - B: Thorium\n    - C: Samarium\n    - D: Radium\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) Which element can be used to absorb excess neutrons in a nuclear power station?\n    - A: Boron\n    - B: Carbon\n    - C: Samarium\n    - D: Helium\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How does samarium's ability to change oxidation states affect its usefulness in chemistry?\n    - A: It makes it less useful\n    - B: It has no effect\n    - C: It makes it more useful\n    - D: It is irrelevant\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How does the reactivity of samarium compare to argon?\n    - A: Samarium is less reactive than argon\n    - B: Samarium is more reactive than argon\n    - C: Samarium and argon have similar reactivity\n    - D: The reactivity of samarium and argon cannot be compared\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the primary reason samarium is used in nuclear power stations?\n    - A: Its high melting point\n    - B: Its ability to change oxidation states\n    - C: Its role as a neutron absorber\n    - D: Its low atomic mass\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is an effective method for storing and handling reactive materials like samarium?\n    - A: Storing in oxygen or nitrogen\n    - B: Storing in an inert gas like argon\n    - C: Storing in a highly reactive gas\n    - D: Storing in a vacuum\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Why is argon effective for storing samarium samples?\n    - A: Because it is highly reactive\n    - B: Because it is not a noble gas\n    - C: Because it is an inert gas\n    - D: Because it is a highly reactive gas\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the importance of samarium's role as a neutron absorber in nuclear power stations?\n    - A: It prevents accidents by absorbing excess neutrons\n    - B: It increases the reaction rate by absorbing excess neutrons\n    - C: It has no effect on the reaction rate\n    - D: It is not used in nuclear power stations\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed question 9 from the original set and rephrased it to focus on the primary reason samarium is used in nuclear power stations. No other significant changes were necessary."
