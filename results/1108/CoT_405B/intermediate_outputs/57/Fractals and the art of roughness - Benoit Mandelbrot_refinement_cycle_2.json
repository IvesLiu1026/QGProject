    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What term does the speaker prefer to use to describe the complexity of shapes in nature, instead of \"irregularity\"?\n    - A: Roughness\n    - B: Complexity\n    - C: Chaos\n    - D: Fractality\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What happens to the surface area of a cauliflower as you measure it more closely?\n    - A: It decreases\n    - B: It remains the same\n    - C: It increases\n    - D: It becomes impossible to measure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) According to the speaker, what is the issue with measuring the length of a coastline?\n    - A: It is a fixed value that can be measured precisely\n    - B: It increases as you measure it more closely\n    - C: It decreases as you measure it more closely\n    - D: The concept of length is not applicable\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) How did the speaker's work on fractals contribute to the study of lungs?\n    - A: It helped surgeons understand the structure of the lung\n    - B: It led to the discovery of a new type of lung disease\n    - C: It revealed that lungs are perfectly smooth\n    - D: It showed that lungs are not related to fractal geometry\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) What is the characteristic of the Mandelbrot set, according to the speaker?\n    - A: It is a simple shape with a complex equation\n    - B: It is a complex shape that arises from a simple equation\n    - C: It is a shape that only appears in nature\n    - D: It is a shape that only appears in art\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
