    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the population experiences motion sickness?\n    - A: Approximately one-quarter\n    - B: Approximately one-third\n    - C: Approximately one-half\n    - D: Approximately three-quarters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary function of the vestibular system in the human body?\n    - A: To detect sound waves\n    - B: To detect movement and balance\n    - C: To regulate body temperature\n    - D: To control blood pressure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) According to the concept of mismatched sensory signals, what is a possible cause of motion sickness?\n    - A: The body's response to certain foods\n    - B: The conflicting information from the eyes and ears\n    - C: The lack of sleep or fatigue\n    - D: The type of vehicle or mode of transportation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How does the vestibular system detect movement and balance in the human body?\n    - A: Through the movement of muscles and joints\n    - B: Through the fluid in the sacks and the semicircular tubules\n    - C: Through the changes in blood pressure\n    - D: Through the sensations in the skin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A person is planning a long car ride and is prone to motion sickness. What remedy might be effective in preventing motion sickness?\n    - A: Reading a book or watching a video\n    - B: Looking at the horizon or taking breaks\n    - C: Eating a heavy meal or drinking caffeine\n    - D: Listening to music or taking a nap\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) Why is it crucial to find effective remedies for motion sickness, especially in high-stakes situations like space travel?\n    - A: Because motion sickness is a minor issue with no significant consequences\n    - B: Because motion sickness can affect anyone, regardless of their health status\n    - C: Because motion sickness can have severe consequences, such as impaired performance and safety risks\n    - D: Because motion sickness is only a problem for astronauts or people in specific professions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How do the vestibular system and the eyes work together to detect movement and balance?\n    - A: They work independently, with no communication between them\n    - B: They work together, with the vestibular system providing information about movement and the eyes providing visual cues\n    - C: They work in opposition, with the vestibular system detecting movement and the eyes detecting balance\n    - D: They work in a hierarchical manner, with the vestibular system overriding the eyes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the relationship between the body's response to motion sickness and its response to poisons?\n    - A: The body responds similarly to motion sickness and poisons, with the same symptoms and mechanisms\n    - B: The body responds differently to motion sickness and poisons, with distinct symptoms and mechanisms\n    - C: The body responds more severely to motion sickness than to poisons\n    - D: The body responds more severely to poisons than to motion sickness\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How do the ideas of mismatched sensory signals and the vestibular system combine to understand the complexities of motion sickness?\n    - A: The vestibular system is the sole cause of motion sickness\n    - B: The conflicting information from the eyes and ears is the sole cause of motion sickness\n    - C: The combination of the vestibular system and mismatched sensory signals contributes to motion sickness\n    - D: The vestibular system and mismatched sensory signals are unrelated to motion sickness\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the potential connection between motion sickness and the body's response to poisons?\n    - A: Motion sickness is caused by the body's response to poisons\n    - B: Motion sickness is unrelated to the body's response to poisons\n    - C: The body's response to poisons may be an evolutionary explanation for motion sickness\n    - D: The body's response to motion sickness is more severe than its response to poisons\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the validity of the evolutionary explanation for motion sickness?\n    - A: It is a proven fact, supported by overwhelming evidence\n    - B: It is a widely accepted theory, with some supporting evidence\n    - C: It is a possible explanation that requires further research and evidence\n    - D: It is an invalid explanation, with no supporting evidence\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the effectiveness of looking at the horizon as a remedy for motion sickness?\n    - A: It is a proven remedy, effective for everyone\n    - B: It is a widely accepted remedy, effective for most people\n    - C: It is a possible remedy that may work for some people, but its effectiveness varies\n    - D: It is an ineffective remedy, with no supporting evidence\n[Correct answer]: C"
