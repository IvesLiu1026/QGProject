Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who is credited with the statement that led to the myth that we use only 10% of our brain?\n    - A: Sigmund Freud\n    - B: William James\n    - C: Albert Einstein\n    - D: Charles Darwin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What percentage of daily glucose burned is used by an adult human brain?\n    - A: 10%\n    - B: 20%\n    - C: 30%\n    - D: 40%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the actual nature of brain activity, contrary to the 10% myth?\n    - A: The brain is mostly inactive and inefficient.\n    - B: The brain is highly active and energy-inefficient.\n    - C: The brain is highly active and energy-efficient due to sparse coding.\n    - D: The brain is mostly inactive and energy-efficient.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to include \"due to sparse coding\" to provide more context.\n\n4) What is the role of the frontal lobes and parietal lobe in brain function?\n    - A: They are responsible for sensory processing.\n    - B: They are crucial for executive and integrative abilities, such as abstract reasoning and planning.\n    - C: They are involved in motor control.\n    - D: They are responsible for emotional regulation.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to provide more specific examples of executive and integrative abilities.\n\n5) How can understanding the brain's energy efficiency inform daily tasks?\n    - A: By prioritizing multitasking to increase productivity.\n    - B: By prioritizing tasks and avoiding multitasking to minimize energy waste.\n    - C: By taking regular breaks to rest the brain.\n    - D: By engaging in mentally demanding activities for extended periods.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to include \"to minimize energy waste\" to provide more context.\n\n6) What dietary implication can be drawn from recognizing the importance of cooking in human evolution?\n    - A: Cooking is unnecessary for human survival.\n    - B: A raw food diet is the most energy-efficient.\n    - C: Cooking can inform dietary choices and food preparation methods, as it allows for more efficient energy absorption.\n    - D: A high-carbohydrate diet is essential for brain function.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to provide more context on how cooking affects energy absorption.\n\n7) What is the relationship between brain size and energy consumption in humans?\n    - A: Directly proportional, with larger brains consuming more energy.\n    - B: Inversely proportional, with larger brains consuming less energy.\n    - C: Not directly proportional, with humans having a relatively small brain but high energy consumption due to dense neuron packing.\n    - D: Unrelated, with brain size having no impact on energy consumption.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to include \"due to dense neuron packing\" to provide more context.\n\n8) What does the contrast between the 10% myth and actual brain function highlight?\n    - A: The importance of relying on assumptions.\n    - B: The importance of accurate information and critical thinking in understanding brain function.\n    - C: The need for more research on brain function.\n    - D: The limitations of neuroscience in understanding brain function.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to include \"in understanding brain function\" to provide more context.\n\n9) How can the combination of the brain's energy efficiency and sparse coding inform strategies for mental performance?\n    -
