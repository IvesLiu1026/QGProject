    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is a characteristic of alkali metals?\n    - A: They are highly unreactive.\n    - B: They are very radioactive.\n    - C: They are very reactive.\n    - D: They have high melting points.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) Who discovered Francium in 1939?\n    - A: Madame Curie\n    - B: One of Madame Curie's pupils\n    - C: Albert Einstein\n    - D: A team of scientists at CERN\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined option D to make it more plausible but incorrect.\n\n3) Why do the reactions of alkali metals with water become more violent as you go down the periodic table?\n    - A: The size of the atom decreases, making it harder to remove an electron from the outer shell.\n    - B: The size of the atom increases, making it easier to remove an electron from the outer shell.\n    - C: The number of electrons in the outer shell increases, making it more reactive.\n    - D: The number of protons in the nucleus decreases, making it less stable.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined options C and D to make them more plausible but incorrect.\n\n4) What makes it challenging for chemists to study the chemistry of certain elements in detail?\n    - A: Radioactivity\n    - B: High melting points\n    - C: Low reactivity\n    - D: High toxicity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What is a potential application of the reactivity of alkali metals?\n    - A: Creating non-reactive materials for storage containers\n    - B: Developing new materials or technologies, such as batteries or catalysts\n    - C: Studying the properties of noble gases\n    - D: Creating highly reactive materials for medical applications\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined option D to make it more plausible but incorrect.\n\n6) How can understanding the properties of radioactive elements like francium be useful?\n    - A: It can help scientists develop strategies for handling and storing these materials safely.\n    - B: It can help scientists create highly reactive materials.\n    - C: It can help scientists study the properties of non-radioactive elements.\n    - D: It can help scientists develop new methods for discovering elements.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between the size of an atom and its reactivity?\n    - A: As the size of the atom increases, its reactivity decreases.\n    - B: As the size of the atom decreases, its reactivity increases.\n    - C: As the size of the atom increases, its reactivity increases.\n    - D: There is no relationship between the size of an atom and its reactivity.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What can be inferred about the properties of francium based on its radioactivity?\n    - A: It is likely to be highly unreactive.\n    - B: It is likely to have a high melting point.\n    - C: It is likely to be similar to those of cesium, but its radioactivity makes it challenging to study.\n    - D: It is likely to be a noble gas.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What can be hypothesized about the potential properties of new, undiscovered elements in the same group as alkali metals?\n    - A: They will be highly unreactive and have low melting points.\n    - B: They will be highly reactive and have low melting points.\n    - C: They will be highly radioactive and have high melting points.\n    - D: They will be non-radioactive and have high melting points.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What can be hypothesized about the potential appearance of francium?\n    - A: It is likely to be a solid at room temperature and have a silver color.\n    - B: It is likely to be a liquid at room temperature and have a reddish color.\n    - C: It is likely to be a gas at room temperature and have a colorless appearance.\n    - D: It is likely to be a solid at room temperature and have a colorless appearance.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined option B to make it more accurate based on the transcript.\n\n11) Evaluate the statement that francium is \"probably very warm\" due to its radioactivity.\n    - A: The statement is accurate and valid based on scientific principles.\n    - B: The statement is inaccurate and invalid based on scientific principles.\n    - C: The statement is partially accurate but lacks sufficient evidence.\n    - D: The statement is irrelevant to the properties of francium.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) Evaluate the claim that francium's melting point will be lower than that of cesium due to its radioactivity.\n    - A: The claim is supported by available data and scientific principles.\n    - B: The claim is not supported by available data and scientific principles.\n    - C: The claim is partially supported but requires further evidence.\n    - D: The claim is irrelevant to the properties of francium.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed."
