What remedy might be effective in preventing motion sickness?\n    - A: Reading a book\n    - B: Looking at the horizon\n    - C: Eating a heavy meal\n    - D: Listening to music\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why is it important to find effective remedies for motion sickness, especially in high-stakes situations like space travel?\n    - A: Because motion sickness is a minor issue\n    - B: Because motion sickness can affect anyone\n    - C: Because motion sickness can have serious consequences in high-stakes situations\n    - D: Because motion sickness is only a problem for astronauts\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the vestibular system and the eyes in detecting movement and balance?\n    - A: The vestibular system and the eyes work independently\n    - B: The vestibular system and the eyes work together to detect movement and balance\n    - C: The vestibular system detects movement and the eyes detect balance\n    - D: The vestibular system detects balance and the eyes detect movement\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the contrast between the body's response to motion sickness and its response to poisons?\n    - A: The body responds similarly to motion sickness and poisons\n    - B: The body responds differently to motion sickness and poisons\n    - C: The body responds more severely to motion sickness than to poisons\n    - D: The body responds more severely to poisons than to motion sickness\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1) How do the ideas of mismatched sensory signals and the vestibular system combine to understand the complexities of motion sickness?\n    - A: The vestibular system causes motion sickness\n    - B: The conflicting information from the eyes and ears causes motion sickness\n    - C: The combination of the vestibular system and mismatched sensory signals contributes to motion sickness\n    - D: The vestibular system and mismatched sensory signals are unrelated to motion sickness\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the potential connection between motion sickness and the body's response to poisons?\n    - A: Motion sickness is caused by the body's response to poisons\n    - B: Motion sickness is unrelated to the body's response to poisons\n    - C: The body's response to poisons may be an evolutionary explanation for motion sickness\n    - D: The body's response to motion sickness is more severe than its response to poisons\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1) What is the validity of the evolutionary explanation for motion sickness?\n    - A: It is a proven fact\n    - B: It is a widely accepted theory\n    - C: It is a possible explanation that requires further research\n    - D: It is an invalid explanation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the effectiveness of looking at the horizon as a remedy for motion sickness?\n    - A: It is a proven remedy\n    - B: It is a widely accepted remedy\n    - C: It is a possible remedy that may work for some people\n    - D: It is an ineffective remedy\n[Correct answer]: C"
