If the player's hang time is 0.8 seconds, what is the maximum height reached by the player? (Assume g = 9.8 meters per second squared)\n    - A: 2 meters\n    - B: 4 meters\n    - C: 6 meters\n    - D: 8 meters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A skydiver jumps from a plane at an altitude of 1000 meters. If the skydiver's parachute opens after 5 seconds, what is the approximate gravitational acceleration acting on the skydiver during the free fall? (Assume the skydiver's initial velocity is 0 meters per second)\n    - A: 8.87 meters per second squared\n    - B: 9.8 meters per second squared\n    - C: 10.9 meters per second squared\n    - D: 24.92 meters per second squared\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the shape of the graph representing the relationship between the height of an object and time spent in the air?\n    - A: Linear\n    - B: Quadratic\n    - C: Cubic\n    - D: Exponential\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What does the vertex of the parabola represent in the graph of the height of an object versus time?\n    - A: The takeoff time\n    - B: The landing time\n    - C: The maximum height\n    - D: The initial velocity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) A sports equipment designer wants to create a new type of basketball that can bounce higher than existing balls. What concept should the designer combine with the equation for the height of a falling object above a surface to create a new model for the ball's motion?\n    - A: Air resistance\n    - B: Gravity\n    - C: Friction\n    - D: Elasticity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) A coach wants to design a new training program for athletes to improve their vertical jump. What concept should the coach consider when applying the equation for the height of a falling object above a surface to create a new model for the athlete's motion?\n    - A: Muscle strength\n    - B: Muscle endurance\n    - C: Power\n    - D: Gravity and air resistance\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) A researcher claims that the equation for the height of a falling object above a surface is accurate for all scenarios. What is a potential flaw in the researcher's claim?\n    - A: The equation assumes a constant gravitational acceleration\n    - B: The equation assumes a constant initial velocity\n    - C: The equation assumes a constant initial height\n    - D: The equation assumes no air resistance\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) A sports analyst claims that Michael Jordan's hang time of 0.92 seconds is the longest ever recorded. What is a potential flaw in the analyst's claim?\n    - A: The analyst did not account for the gravitational acceleration on Earth\n    - B: The analyst did not account for the initial velocity of the jump\n    - C: The analyst did not account for the initial height of the jump\n    - D: The analyst did not compare the hang time to other athletes in different environments\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefinements made include:\n\n- Clarifying the context of the human limit for hang time in question 1\n- Changing the wording of question 10 to make it more accurate and clear\n- Changing the wording of question 12 to make it more accurate and clear\n\nNo more major refinements are needed. However, further review and testing may be necessary to ensure the questions are accurate and effective."
