Gluten is found in certain grains, particularly wheat, rye, and barley.\n3. Gluten is responsible for the elastic consistency of dough and the chewiness of foods made from wheat flour.\n4. Wheat allergy is an uncommon condition that occurs when a person's immune system mounts an allergic response to wheat proteins.\n5. Celiac disease is an inherited disease, in which eating foods with gluten leads to inflammation and damage of the lining of the small intestine.\n6. Celiac disease is present in one in every 100 to 200 persons in the U.S.\n7. The most effective treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet.\n8. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a condition in which people experience symptoms when they eat foods with gluten, but do not have celiac disease or a wheat allergy.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The concept of gluten and its role in food production and human health.\n2. The differences between wheat allergy, celiac disease, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.\n3. The symptoms and consequences of untreated celiac disease.\n4. The challenges of diagnosing non-celiac gluten sensitivity due to the lack of reliable blood or tissue tests.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. A person with celiac disease needs to follow a gluten-free diet to manage their condition.\n2. A person with non-celiac gluten sensitivity may need to try a gluten-free diet to alleviate symptoms.\n3. Food manufacturers and restaurants need to label and prepare gluten-free options for customers with gluten-related disorders.\n4. Healthcare professionals need to consider the possibility of gluten-related disorders when diagnosing patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and contrasts)**\n\n1. The relationship between gluten and the development of wheat allergy, celiac disease, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.\n2. The contrast between the symptoms and consequences of wheat allergy, celiac disease, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.\n3. The potential causes of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, including the activation of the immune system, leaky gut, and sensitivity to fructans.\n4. The role of the nocebo effect in the development of gluten sensitivity.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. The concept of wheat intolerance as a more accurate term to describe non-celiac gluten sensitivity.\n2. The idea that gluten-related disorders are complex and multifaceted, requiring a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment.\n3. The need for further research into the causes and consequences of gluten-related disorders.\n4. The importance of considering the psychological and social factors that contribute to the development of gluten-related disorders.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n1. The validity of the term \"gluten-free\" as a marketing label and its potential impact on consumer behavior.\n2. The effectiveness of gluten-free diets in managing gluten-related disorders.\n3. The reliability of blood tests and biopsies in diagnosing gluten-related disorders.\n4. The role of media and societal trends in shaping public perceptions of gluten and gluten-related disorders."
