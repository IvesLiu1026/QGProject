(Assume the skydiver's initial velocity is 0 meters per second)\n    - A: 8.87 meters per second squared\n    - B: 9.8 meters per second squared\n    - C: 10.9 meters per second squared\n    - D: 24.92 meters per second squared\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the shape of the graph representing the relationship between the height of an object and time spent in the air?\n    - A: Linear\n    - B: Quadratic\n    - C: Cubic\n    - D: Exponential\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What does the vertex of the parabola represent in the graph of the height of an object versus time?\n    - A: The takeoff time\n    - B: The landing time\n    - C: The maximum height\n    - D: The initial velocity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) A sports equipment designer wants to create a new type of basketball that can bounce higher than existing balls. What concept should the designer combine with the equation for the height of a falling object above a surface to create a new model for the ball's motion?\n    - A: Air resistance\n    - B: Gravity\n    - C: Friction\n    - D: Elasticity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) A coach wants to design a new training program for athletes to improve their vertical jump. What concept should the coach consider when applying the equation for the height of a falling object above a surface to create a new model for the athlete's motion?\n    - A: Muscle strength\n    - B: Muscle endurance\n    - C: Power\n    - D: Gravity and air resistance\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) A researcher claims that the equation for the height of a falling object above a surface is accurate for all scenarios. What is a potential flaw in the researcher's claim?\n    - A: The equation assumes a constant gravitational acceleration\n    - B: The equation assumes a constant initial velocity\n    - C: The equation assumes a constant initial height\n    - D: The equation assumes no air resistance\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) How would Michael Jordan's hang time change if he were playing on the moon, which has a much weaker gravitational pull than Earth?\n    - A: His hang time would decrease\n    - B: His hang time would remain the same\n    - C: His hang time would increase\n    - D: His hang time would become infinite\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made changes to questions 5 and 12 to better align with the transcript and ensure clarity and conciseness. The other questions remain the same, as they were already clear and accurate."
