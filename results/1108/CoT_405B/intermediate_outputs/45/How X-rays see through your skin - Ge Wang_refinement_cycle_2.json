    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who discovered X-rays in 1895 while conducting experiments with a cathode tube?\n    - A: Wilhelm Roentgen\n    - B: Nikola Tesla\n    - C: Thomas Edison\n    - D: Albert Einstein\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What type of electromagnetic radiation has higher energy than visible light and lower energy than Gamma rays?\n    - A: Ultraviolet radiation\n    - B: Infrared radiation\n    - C: X-rays\n    - D: Microwaves\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What process occurs when high-energy electrons in a cathode tube hit a metal component, releasing energy in the form of X-rays?\n    - A: Electron emission\n    - B: X-ray absorption\n    - C: X-ray production\n    - D: Ionization\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What principle do CT scans involve to construct an internal image of the body?\n    - A: Taking X-ray views from a single angle\n    - B: Taking X-ray views from multiple angles around the body\n    - C: Using a single X-ray detector\n    - D: Using only low-energy X-rays\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a common medical application of X-rays?\n    - A: Detecting magnetic fields\n    - B: Imaging organs and detecting diseases\n    - C: Measuring blood pressure\n    - D: Monitoring heart rate\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) Why are lead aprons used in medical settings when working with X-rays?\n    - A: To protect against magnetic fields\n    - B: To protect against X-ray radiation\n    - C: To protect against visible light\n    - D: To protect against Gamma rays\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What factors determine the frequency of X-ray absorption or scattering in a material?\n    - A: Density and atomic number\n    - B: Density and temperature\n    - C: Atomic number and temperature\n    - D: Density and pressure\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) Why do bones absorb X-rays well?\n    - A: Due to their low density and low atomic number\n    - B: Due to their high density and low atomic number\n    - C: Due to their low density and high atomic number\n    - D: Due to their high density and high atomic number\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What is a potential benefit of using X-ray imaging in medical applications?\n    - A: Reduced diagnostic accuracy\n    - B: Increased radiation exposure\n    - C: Improved detection of soft tissue abnormalities\n    - D: Decreased medical imaging costs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a potential application of X-rays in medical imaging?\n    - A: Detecting defects in materials\n    - B: Measuring material density\n    - C: Analyzing material composition\n    - D: Imaging organs and detecting diseases\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is a potential risk associated with X-ray radiation in medical imaging?\n    - A: Increased diagnostic accuracy\n    - B: Reduced radiation exposure\n    - C: Mutations in reproductive organs and tissues\n    - D: Decreased medical imaging costs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What factors should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of lead aprons in protecting against X-ray radiation?\n    - A: Thickness of the apron\n    - B: Material composition of the apron\n    - C: Frequency of X-ray exposure\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 3 and 8 to improve clarity and conciseness. The remaining questions were already well-crafted and aligned with the key concepts in the transcript. No further refinement is necessary for the other questions.\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1, 2, 4-7, 9-12."
