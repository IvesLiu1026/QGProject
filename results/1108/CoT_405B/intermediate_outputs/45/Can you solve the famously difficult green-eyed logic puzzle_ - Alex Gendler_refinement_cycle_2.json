    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) How many people are imprisoned by the mad dictator in the given scenario?\n    - A: 50\n    - B: 75\n    - C: 100\n    - D: 200\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Who coined the concept of common knowledge?\n    - A: David Hume\n    - B: David Lewis\n    - C: Immanuel Kant\n    - D: Jean-Paul Sartre\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the condition for the prisoners to leave the island?\n    - A: They must have blue eyes and ask to leave during the day.\n    - B: They must have green eyes and ask to leave at night.\n    - C: They must have brown eyes and ask to leave during the day.\n    - D: They must have green eyes and ask to leave during the day.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What type of reasoning do the prisoners use to figure out their own eye color?\n    - A: Deductive reasoning\n    - B: Inductive reasoning\n    - C: Abductive reasoning\n    - D: Analogical reasoning\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) In what type of situations can the concept of common knowledge be applied?\n    - A: Only in situations where individuals have conflicting goals.\n    - B: Only in situations where individuals have the same goals.\n    - C: In situations where shared information affects decision-making.\n    - D: In situations where individual knowledge is sufficient for decision-making.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a real-world application of inductive reasoning and common knowledge?\n    - A: Solving mathematical equations\n    - B: Analyzing literary texts\n    - C: Problem-solving in group settings\n    - D: Conducting scientific experiments\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the number of prisoners and the number of nights it takes for them to figure out their eye color?\n    - A: The number of nights is directly proportional to the number of prisoners minus one.\n    - B: The number of nights is inversely proportional to the number of prisoners.\n    - C: The number of nights is equal to the number of prisoners.\n    - D: There is no relationship between the number of prisoners and the number of nights.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the effect of the visitor's statement on the prisoners' ability to figure out their eye color?\n    - A: It provides new information that helps them figure out their eye color.\n    - B: It creates common knowledge that helps them figure out their eye color.\n    - C: It distracts them from figuring out their eye color.\n    - D: It has no effect on their ability to figure out their eye color.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be created by combining the concepts of inductive reasoning and common knowledge?\n    - A: A new understanding of how shared information can affect decision-making.\n    - B: A new method for solving mathematical equations.\n    - C: A new approach to literary analysis.\n    - D: A new technique for conducting scientific experiments.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) How can the prisoner's dilemma be used in real-world scenarios?\n    - A: To develop new problem-solving strategies in group settings.\n    - B: To analyze literary texts for themes and motifs.\n    - C: To conduct scientific experiments on human behavior.\n    - D: To solve complex mathematical equations.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) Why might the visitor's decision to tell the prisoners \"At least one of you has green eyes\" be justified?\n    - A: Because it provides new information that helps them figure out their eye color.\n    - B: Because it creates common knowledge that helps them figure out their eye color without giving away too much information.\n    - C: Because it distracts them from figuring out their eye color.\n    - D: Because it has no effect on their ability to figure out their eye color.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What can be said about the effectiveness of the prisoners' inductive reasoning strategy?\n    - A: It is ineffective because it takes too many nights for them to figure out their eye color.\n    - B: It is effective because it allows them to figure out their eye color with certainty.\n    - C: It is ineffective because it relies on individual knowledge rather than common knowledge.\n    - D: It is effective because it is based on deductive reasoning.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-6 and 8-12. \n\nHowever, I suggest rephrasing question 7 for better clarity and accuracy.\n\n7) What is the relationship between the number of prisoners and the number of nights it takes for them to figure out their eye color?\n    - A: The number of nights is one less than the number of prisoners.\n    - B: The number of nights is inversely proportional to the number of prisoners.\n    - C: The number of nights is equal to the number of prisoners.\n    - D: There is no relationship between the number of prisoners and the number of nights.\n[Correct answer]: A"
