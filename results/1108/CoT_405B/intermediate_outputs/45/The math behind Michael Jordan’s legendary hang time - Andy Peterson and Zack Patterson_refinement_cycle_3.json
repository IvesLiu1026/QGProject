    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the approximate human limit for hang time on a flat surface?\n    - A: 0.5 seconds\n    - B: 1 second\n    - C: 2 seconds\n    - D: 5 seconds\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the gravitational acceleration on Earth's surface?\n    - A: 8.87 meters per second squared\n    - B: 9.8 meters per second squared\n    - C: 10.9 meters per second squared\n    - D: 24.92 meters per second squared\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary factor that affects the hang time of an object?\n    - A: Initial velocity\n    - B: Initial height\n    - C: Force of gravity\n    - D: Air resistance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What can be used to model and calculate hang time?\n    - A: The equation for the velocity of a falling object\n    - B: The equation for the height of a falling object above a surface\n    - C: The equation for the acceleration of a falling object\n    - D: The equation for the force of gravity on an object\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A basketball player jumps from the free throw line with an initial velocity of 4.51 meters per second. If the player's hang time is 0.92 seconds, what is the maximum height reached by the player? (Assume g = 9.8 meters per second squared)\n    - A: 0.5 meters\n    - B: 1.038 meters\n    - C: 2 meters\n    - D: 4 meters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the shape of the graph representing the relationship between the height of an object and time spent in the air?\n    - A: Linear\n    - B: Quadratic\n    - C: Cubic\n    - D: Exponential\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What does the vertex of the parabola represent in the graph of the height of an object versus time?\n    - A: The takeoff time\n    - B: The landing time\n    - C: The maximum height\n    - D: The initial velocity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How would Michael Jordan's hang time change if he were playing on the moon, which has a much weaker gravitational pull than Earth?\n    - A: His hang time would decrease\n    - B: His hang time would remain the same\n    - C: His hang time would increase\n    - D: His hang time would become infinite\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What concept should be considered when applying the equation for the height of a falling object above a surface to create a new model for an athlete's motion?\n    - A: Muscle strength\n    - B: Muscle endurance\n    - C: Power\n    - D: Gravity and air resistance\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is a potential flaw in the equation for the height of a falling object above a surface?\n    - A: The equation assumes a constant gravitational acceleration\n    - B: The equation assumes a constant initial velocity\n    - C: The equation assumes a constant initial height\n    - D: The equation assumes no air resistance\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI removed questions 6 (about the skydiver), 9 (about the sports equipment designer), 11 (about the researcher's claim), and 12 (which was redundant with question 8) to make the set more concise and focused on the key concepts. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and concision. No more refinement needed."
