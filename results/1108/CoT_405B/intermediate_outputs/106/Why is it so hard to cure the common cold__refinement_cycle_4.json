    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What was the outcome of William Price's 1957 rhinovirus vaccine trial?\n    - A: The vaccine provided long-term protection against all subtypes of rhinovirus.\n    - B: The vaccine showed no protection against rhinovirus in the initial trial.\n    - C: The vaccine provided protection against one or a few subtypes of rhinovirus, but not all.\n    - D: The vaccine trial was inconclusive due to a small sample size.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is it challenging to create a broadly protective vaccine against rhinovirus?\n    - A: Rhinovirus has a low mutation rate, making it an easy target for vaccines.\n    - B: Rhinovirus has multiple subtypes, making it difficult to create a vaccine that provides broad protection.\n    - C: The immune system's response to rhinovirus is not well understood, hindering vaccine development.\n    - D: Rhinovirus is highly contagious, making it difficult to develop an effective vaccine.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why can different viruses cause the same illness, such as the common cold?\n    - A: Viruses can only invade the body through a few specific routes, triggering similar immune responses.\n    - B: Viruses have similar genetic codes, making them difficult to distinguish.\n    - C: The immune system's response to different viruses is identical, resulting in similar symptoms.\n    - D: Viruses target the same cells and tissues, leading to similar illnesses.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is the name of the CRISPR system that has shown promise as an antiviral agent against coronavirus and influenza?\n    - A: PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in human cells)\n    - B: CRISPR-Cas9\n    - C: CRISPR-Cas13\n    - D: Antiviral CRISPR System (ACS)\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) Why did the pleconaril treatment fail in some patients?\n    - A: The treatment was not effective against the common cold.\n    - B: The virus mutated quickly and became resistant to the treatment.\n    - C: The treatment had severe side effects, leading to discontinuation.\n    - D: The treatment was not administered correctly, reducing its efficacy.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the primary reason why people with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to serious illnesses from common cold viruses?\n    - A: Their immune system is unable to produce antibodies against the virus.\n    - B: Their immune system is unable to trigger an inflammatory response to the virus.\n    - C: Their immune system is unable to prevent the virus from replicating and spreading.\n    - D: Their immune system is unable to recognize the virus.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the main advantage of using CRISPR as an antiviral agent?\n    - A: CRISPR can target specific viral genes, reducing the risk of off-target effects.\n    - B: CRISPR can provide long-term protection against viral infections.\n    - C: CRISPR can be used to treat a wide range of viral infections.\n    - D: CRISPR can be used to prevent viral infections from occurring in the first place.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo significant changes were made to the questions, as they were already well-written and aligned with the key concepts in the transcript. However, I did review the distractors to ensure they were plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers were accurate. No more refinement needed."
