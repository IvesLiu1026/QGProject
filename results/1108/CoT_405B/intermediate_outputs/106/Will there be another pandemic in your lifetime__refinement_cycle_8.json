    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript and initial set of questions, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which of the following pandemics are examples of catastrophic, world-changing pandemics?\n    - A: The Black Death, 1918 Flu Pandemic, and COVID-19\n    - B: The 1918 Flu Pandemic and HIV/AIDS\n    - C: The Black Death and the 2009 swine flu\n    - D: The 2009 swine flu and COVID-19\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Approximately how many as-yet-undiscovered viruses are estimated to currently infect mammals and birds?\n    - A: 100,000\n    - B: 500,000\n    - C: 1.7 million\n    - D: 2.5 million\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is a key takeaway from analyzing historical data on pandemics?\n    - A: Pandemics are rare and unpredictable events\n    - B: Pandemics are more common than we think, and it's essential to understand the risks and probabilities associated with them\n    - C: Pandemics can only be prevented with the development of new technologies\n    - D: Pandemics are only caused by newly emerging diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What approaches can be used to estimate the likelihood of a COVID-19-level pandemic?\n    - A: Historical data only\n    - B: Modeling only\n    - C: Historical data and modeling\n    - D: Expert opinions and historical data\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is essential to understand in order to inform public health policy and decision-making regarding pandemics?\n    - A: The causes and consequences of pandemics\n    - B: The probability and risks associated with pandemics\n    - C: The impact of pandemics on the economy and society\n    - D: The role of new technologies in preventing and treating pandemics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What measures can be applied to real-world scenarios to reduce the spread of diseases?\n    - A: Early warning systems and social distancing\n    - B: Contact tracing and next-generation antiviral drugs\n    - C: A combination of early warning systems, contact tracing, social distancing, and other public health measures\n    - D: AI-powered contact tracing and universal vaccines\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the estimated yearly probability of a COVID-19-level pandemic using a combination of historical data and modeling?\n    - A: 0.5%\n    - B: 1.4%\n    - C: 2%\n    - D: 2.5-3.3%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the estimated lifetime probability of experiencing at least one COVID-19-level pandemic?\n    - A: 22%\n    - B: 31%\n    - C: 78%\n    - D: 92%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the main idea of using probability tree diagrams to model pandemics?\n    - A: To estimate the yearly probability of a pandemic\n    - B: To estimate the lifetime probability of experiencing at least one pandemic\n    - C: To visualize and calculate the probability of different pandemic scenarios\n    - D: To predict the exact timing and severity of pandemics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) According to the transcript, what is the longest stretch of time without a documented outbreak that killed at least 10,000 people in the past four centuries?\n    - A: 1 year\n    - B: 4 years\n    - C: 10 years\n    - D: 20 years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the estimated number of as-yet-undiscovered viruses that have the potential to spill over and infect humans?\n    - A: 100,000\n    - B: 500,000\n    - C: 680,000 (40% of 1.7 million)\n    - D: 1 million\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) According to the transcript, what is the estimated number of lives saved by early warning systems, contact tracing, social distancing, and other public health measures in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US?\n    - A: 100,000\n    - B: 500,000\n    - C: 1 million\n    - D: 2 million\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 13-17 as they were redundant or not essential to the key concepts. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and conciseness. No more refinement needed."
