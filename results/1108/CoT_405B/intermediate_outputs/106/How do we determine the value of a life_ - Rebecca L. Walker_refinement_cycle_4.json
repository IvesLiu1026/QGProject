A: Jeremy Bentham\n    - B: Peter Singer\n    - C: Immanuel Kant\n    - D: John Locke\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) Why is research being conducted to improve smallpox treatments and vaccines?\n    - A: Due to the high number of smallpox cases in recent years\n    - B: Because modern antiviral drugs have been tested against smallpox\n    - C: The concern that rogue actors might try to weaponize smallpox\n    - D: Since older smallpox vaccines have no side effects\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined question: Why is the US government funding research to improve smallpox treatments and vaccines?\n    - A: Due to the high number of smallpox cases in recent years\n    - B: Because modern antiviral drugs have been tested against smallpox\n    - C: The concern that rogue actors might try to weaponize smallpox\n    - D: Since older smallpox vaccines have no side effects\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the concept of moral status used to determine?\n    - A: The value of human lives only\n    - B: The value of non-human lives only\n    - C: The value of a life, whether human or non-human\n    - D: The value of animal research\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What is a key ethical concern when using animals in research to develop a new smallpox vaccine?\n    - A: The potential harm to the animals involved\n    - B: The potential benefits to human welfare\n    - C: The cost-effectiveness of the research\n    - D: The study's potential to advance scientific knowledge\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What concept should be considered when weighing the potential benefits and harms of research on improving smallpox treatments and vaccines?\n    - A: Moral mathematics\n    - B: Moral status\n    - C: Animal research ethics\n    - D: Public health policy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined question: What concept is relevant to considering the potential benefits and harms of research involving animals?\n    - A: Moral mathematics\n    - B: Moral status\n    - C: Animal research ethics\n    - D: Public health policy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How does the use of animals in research relate to the value of human versus non-human lives?\n    - A: The use of animals in research does not impact the value of human versus non-human lives\n    - B: The use of animals in research reflects a trade-off between human and non-human lives\n    - C: The use of animals in research is only justified when human lives are at risk\n    - D: The use of animals in research is only justified when non-human lives are at risk\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the contrast between the binary and degree-based conceptions of moral status?\n    - A: The binary conception considers moral status as all-or-nothing, while the degree-based conception considers it as a matter of degree\n    - B: The binary conception considers moral status as a matter of degree, while the degree-based conception considers it as all-or-nothing\n    - C: The binary conception considers moral status as only applicable to humans, while the degree-based conception considers it as applicable to all living beings\n    - D: The binary conception considers moral status as only applicable to non-humans, while the degree-based conception considers it as applicable to humans\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) How can considering the relationships between the value of human and non-human lives, the use of animals in research, and the calculation of moral mathematics lead to a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in making moral decisions?\n    - A: By oversimplifying the moral implications\n    - B: By ignoring the perspectives of different philosophers\n    - C: By evaluating the ethics of animal testing and research without considering the value of human versus non-human lives\n    - D: By considering the nuanced relationships between these concepts\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined question: How can examining the connections between human and non-human life values, animal research, and moral mathematics inform moral decision-making?\n    - A: By oversimplifying the moral implications\n    - B: By ignoring the perspectives of different philosophers\n    - C: By evaluating the ethics of animal testing and research without considering the value of human versus non-human lives\n    - D: By considering the nuanced relationships between these concepts\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What can be gained by integrating the perspectives of different philosophers, such as Kant, Bentham, and Singer, on the concept of moral status?\n    -
