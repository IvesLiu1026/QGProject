Why is creating a cure for the common cold challenging?\n    - A: Because it is caused by a single virus\n    - B: Because it is caused by multiple viruses\n    - C: Because it is caused by a bacterial infection\n    - D: Because it is caused by a fungal infection\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. What is the role of the immune system in fighting the common cold?\n    - A: It has no role in fighting the common cold\n    - B: It plays a minor role in fighting the common cold\n    - C: It plays a crucial role in fighting the common cold\n    - D: It is the sole determinant of whether someone gets the common cold\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application**\n\n1. A patient with a weakened immune system is more susceptible to serious infections. What strategy could be employed to boost their immunity?\n    - A: Administering antibiotics\n    - B: Administering antiviral medications\n    - C: Implementing strategies to boost their immune system\n    - D: Providing no treatment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What technology could be applied to create new treatments for the common cold and other viral infections?\n    - A: mRNA vaccines and CRISPR technology\n    - B: Antibiotics and antiviral medications\n    - C: Gene therapy and stem cell therapy\n    - D: Hormone replacement therapy and radiation therapy\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. What is the relationship between the immune system and the common cold?\n    - A: The immune system has no impact on the common cold\n    - B: The immune system plays a minor role in fighting the common cold\n    - C: The immune system plays a crucial role in fighting the common cold, and understanding this relationship is crucial for developing effective treatments\n    - D: The immune system is the sole determinant of whether someone gets the common cold\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. Why is creating a broadly protective vaccine for rhinovirus challenging?\n    - A: Because there is only one subtype of rhinovirus\n    - B: Because there are multiple subtypes of rhinovirus\n    - C: Because rhinovirus mutates slowly\n    - D: Because rhinovirus is not a significant cause of the common cold\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. What could be the result of combining the understanding of the immune system's role in fighting the common cold with the development of new technologies, such as mRNA vaccines and CRISPR?\n    - A: The creation of ineffective treatments\n    - B: The creation of treatments with significant side effects\n    - C: The creation of effective treatments\n    - D: The creation of treatments that are too expensive to be accessible\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What could provide a comprehensive approach to treating the common cold?\n    - A: Using antiviral drugs alone\n    - B: Using vaccines alone\n    - C: Using antiviral drugs in combination with other treatments, such as vaccines\n    - D: Using antibiotics and antiviral medications\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. How can the effectiveness of current treatments for the common cold be evaluated?\n    - A: By considering only the symptoms of the common cold\n    - B: By considering the complexity of the illness and the multiple causes\n    - C: By considering only the cost of the treatments\n    - D: By considering only the accessibility of the treatments\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. What should be considered when evaluating the potential benefits and risks of using CRISPR as an antiviral agent?\n    - A: Only its potential benefits\n    - B: Only its potential risks\n    - C: Both its potential benefits and risks, considering its promise in degrading coronavirus and influenza genomes in lung cells\n    - D: Neither its potential benefits nor risks\n[Correct answer]: C"
