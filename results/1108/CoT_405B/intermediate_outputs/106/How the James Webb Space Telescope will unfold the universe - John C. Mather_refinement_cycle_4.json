    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) At what age did the speaker's father explain the concept of cells and chromosomes, sparking their interest in science?\n    - A: 8 years old\n    - B: 6 years old\n    - C: 10 years old\n    - D: 12 years old\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Where is the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) located?\n    - A: Lagrange Point 1\n    - B: Lagrange Point 2\n    - C: Earth's orbit\n    - D: Mars' orbit\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What sparked the speaker's interest in science?\n    - A: Reading about Galileo and Darwin\n    - B: Their father's explanation of cells and chromosomes\n    - C: Watching a documentary about space\n    - D: Conducting a science experiment\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the significance of the JWST's ability to observe infrared light?\n    - A: It allows the telescope to study the formation of black holes\n    - B: It allows the telescope to see distant galaxies and stars that are invisible in visible light\n    - C: It allows the telescope to study the Earth's atmosphere\n    - D: It allows the telescope to observe only visible light\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can the JWST be used to study in the early universe?\n    - A: The formation of planets\n    - B: The formation of galaxies and stars\n    - C: The formation of asteroids\n    - D: The formation of comets\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can the JWST's observations of exoplanet atmospheres be used to search for?\n    - A: Signs of oxygen\n    - B: Signs of water\n    - C: Signs of methane\n    - D: Signs of life, such as the presence of water and organic molecules\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the connection between the Big Bang and cosmic microwave background radiation?\n    - A: They are two separate events\n    - B: The Big Bang caused the cosmic microwave background radiation\n    - C: The cosmic microwave background radiation caused the Big Bang\n    - D: They are not connected\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What can the JWST's observations of distant galaxies and stars be used to better understand?\n    - A: The formation of black holes\n    - B: The origins of the universe, including the formation of galaxies and stars\n    - C: The formation of planets\n    - D: The Earth's atmosphere\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How does the speaker describe the unfolding of the JWST in outer space?\n    - A: A simple and quick process\n    - B: A complex and time-consuming process\n    - C: A process that took several hours\n    - D: A process that took several months\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the purpose of the JWST's sunshade?\n    - A: To protect the telescope from the Sun's heat\n    - B: To reflect infrared light\n    - C: To observe visible light\n    - D: To communicate with Earth\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential future step in the search for life beyond Earth using the JWST?\n    - A: Sending a probe to Mars\n    - B: Sending a probe to Europa\n    - C: Using the JWST to observe the atmospheres of exoplanets that are similar in size to Earth\n    - D: Using the JWST to observe the atmospheres of gas giants\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How long is the JWST expected to be operational?\n    - A: 5 years\n    - B: 10 years\n    - C: 20 years\n    - D: 30 years\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 13-15 as they were redundant or not clear. I also rephrased some questions to make them more concise and clear. Let me know if you need further refinement!"
