    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript and initial questions, I've refined the questions to enhance clarity and conciseness, confirmed distractors are plausible but incorrect, and ensured correct answers are accurate. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What was the outcome of William Price's 1957 rhinovirus vaccine trial?\n    - A: The vaccine provided long-term protection against all subtypes of rhinovirus.\n    - B: The vaccine showed no protection against rhinovirus in the initial trial.\n    - C: The vaccine provided protection against one or a few subtypes of rhinovirus, but not all.\n    - D: The vaccine trial was inconclusive due to a small sample size.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is it challenging to create a broadly protective vaccine against rhinovirus?\n    - A: Rhinovirus has a low mutation rate, making it an easy target for vaccines.\n    - B: Rhinovirus has multiple subtypes, making it difficult to create a vaccine that provides broad protection.\n    - C: Rhinovirus is not a common cause of the common cold, reducing the need for a vaccine.\n    - D: Rhinovirus is easily treatable with antiviral drugs, reducing the need for a vaccine.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why can different viruses cause the same illness, such as the common cold?\n    - A: Viruses can only invade the body through a few specific routes, triggering similar immune responses.\n    - B: Viruses have similar genetic codes, making them difficult to distinguish.\n    - C: Viruses can only infect people with weakened immune systems, making them more susceptible.\n    - D: Viruses are highly contagious, making them easily transmissible.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is the name of the CRISPR system that has shown promise as an antiviral agent against coronavirus and influenza?\n    - A: PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in human cells)\n    - B: CRISPR-Cas9\n    - C: mRNA-CRISPR\n    - D: Antiviral CRISPR System (ACS)\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) Why did the pleconaril treatment fail in some patients?\n    - A: The treatment was not effective against the common cold.\n    - B: The virus mutated quickly and became resistant to the treatment.\n    - C: The treatment had severe side effects, leading to discontinuation.\n    - D: The treatment was not administered correctly, reducing its efficacy.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 6-10, as they were not provided."
