    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What percentage of people sleepwalk at least once in their lives?\n    - A: 5%\n    - B: 10%\n    - C: 18%\n    - D: 25%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which stage of non-REM sleep does sleepwalking typically arise from?\n    - A: Light-wave sleep\n    - B: Slow-wave sleep\n    - C: REM sleep\n    - D: Deep-wave sleep\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What happens to the prefrontal cortex during a sleepwalking episode?\n    - A: It becomes more active\n    - B: It remains unchanged\n    - C: It is inactive, while other parts of the brain are active\n    - D: It is damaged\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why might sleepwalking be more common in children?\n    - A: Due to the developing brain areas that control the transition between sleep and wakefulness\n    - B: Due to the increased amount of REM sleep in children\n    - C: Due to the decreased amount of slow-wave sleep in children\n    - D: Due to the increased amount of stress in children\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Application (Real-World Scenarios)**\n\n1) What should a person with a history of sleepwalking do to prevent harm during episodes?\n    - A: Keep sharp objects in a safe place\n    - B: Hide sharp objects and secure windows\n    - C: Take medication to prevent sleepwalking\n    - D: Ignore the sleepwalking episodes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What should a family member or caregiver do if they encounter a sleepwalker?\n    - A: Try to wake the sleepwalker up\n    - B: Gently guide the sleepwalker back to bed and ensure their safety\n    - C: Leave the sleepwalker alone\n    - D: Call for emergency services\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and Contrasts)**\n\n1) What is the main difference between sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder?\n    - A: Sleepwalking occurs during REM sleep, while REM sleep behavior disorder occurs during non-REM sleep\n    - B: Sleepwalking is a benign condition, while REM sleep behavior disorder is a serious condition\n    - C: Sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder are distinct conditions with different underlying mechanisms\n    - D: Sleepwalking is more common in children, while REM sleep behavior disorder is more common in adults\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How do sleepwalkers differ from wakeful individuals in terms of their actions?\n    - A: Sleepwalkers have more control over their actions\n    - B: Sleepwalkers have less control over their actions\n    - C: Sleepwalkers have the same amount of control over their actions\n    - D: Sleepwalkers are more aware of their actions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1) What may be a contributing factor to the development of sleepwalking behaviors?\n    - A: Disruptions in sleep patterns, such as those caused by sleep disorders or stress\n    - B: Genetics\n    - C: Brain development\n    - D: Medication\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What does the brain's ability to perform complex tasks without deliberate control during sleepwalking episodes suggest?\n    - A: That there is a clear distinction between wakefulness and sleep\n    - B: That there may be a continuum between wakefulness and sleep\n    - C: That sleepwalking is a benign condition\n    - D: That sleepwalking is a serious condition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and Critique)**\n\n1) What is the current understanding of the effectiveness of treatments for sleepwalking?\n    - A: Current treatments are highly effective\n    - B: Current treatments are somewhat effective\n    - C: Current treatments are not well understood, and more research is needed\n    - D: Current treatments are ineffective\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is it important to take safety measures to prevent harm during sleepwalking episodes?\n    - A: Because sleepwalking is a benign condition\n    - B: Because sleepwalking can pose significant risks\n    - C: Because sleepwalking is a rare condition\n    - D: Because sleepwalking is a common condition\n[Correct answer]: B"
