    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which of the following pandemics are examples of catastrophic, world-changing pandemics?\n    - A: The Black Death, 1918 Flu Pandemic, and COVID-19\n    - B: The 1918 Flu Pandemic and HIV/AIDS\n    - C: The Black Death and the 2009 swine flu\n    - D: The 2009 swine flu and COVID-19\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Approximately how many as-yet-undiscovered viruses are estimated to currently infect mammals and birds?\n    - A: 100,000\n    - B: 500,000\n    - C: 1.7 million\n    - D: 2.5 million\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is a key takeaway from analyzing historical data on pandemics?\n    - A: Pandemics are rare and unpredictable events\n    - B: Pandemics are more common than we think, and it's essential to understand the risks and probabilities associated with them\n    - C: Pandemics can only be prevented with the development of new technologies\n    - D: Pandemics are only caused by newly emerging diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What approaches can be used to estimate the likelihood of a COVID-19-level pandemic?\n    - A: Historical data only\n    - B: Modeling only\n    - C: Historical data and modeling\n    - D: Expert opinions and historical data\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is essential to understand in order to inform public health policy and decision-making?\n    - A: The causes of pandemics\n    - B: The probability of pandemics\n    - C: The impact of pandemics on the economy\n    - D: The role of new technologies in preventing pandemics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) Which of the following measures can be applied to real-world scenarios to reduce the spread of diseases?\n    - A: Early warning systems and social distancing\n    - B: Contact tracing and next-generation antiviral drugs\n    - C: Early warning systems, contact tracing, and social distancing\n    - D: AI-powered contact tracing and universal vaccines\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What can be analyzed using historical data on pandemics?\n    - A: The relationship between the probability of a pandemic and the number of years without a pandemic\n    - B: The impact of new technologies on reducing the risk of pandemics\n    - C: The cause-and-effect connection between the emergence of new diseases and the risk of pandemics\n    - D: The effectiveness of public health measures in reducing the spread of diseases\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is a key aspect of understanding pandemics?\n    - A: The relatively low yearly probability and the higher lifetime probability\n    - B: The relationship between the probability of a pandemic and the number of years without a pandemic\n    - C: The impact of proactive measures on reducing the risk of pandemics\n    - D: The role of new technologies in preventing pandemics\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What can provide new insights into the likelihood of pandemics?\n    - A: Combining historical data and expert opinions\n    - B: Combining historical data and modeling\n    - C: Combining the development of new technologies and public health policy\n    - D: Combining the concepts of probability and risk\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the risks associated with pandemics?\n    - A: Integrating the concept of probability tree diagrams with real-world data\n    - B: Integrating the development of new technologies with public health policy\n    - C: Integrating the concepts of probability and risk\n    - D: Integrating historical data and modeling\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What should be evaluated to determine its effectiveness in reducing the spread of diseases?\n    - A: Public health measures, such as early warning systems and contact tracing\n    - B: New technologies, such as universal vaccines and next-generation antiviral drugs\n    - C: The use of probability tree diagrams as a tool for estimating the likelihood of pandemics\n    - D: The trade-offs between the costs and benefits of proactive measures\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What should be justified in terms of investment to prevent and treat pandemics?\n    - A: Public health measures, such as early warning systems and contact tracing\n    - B: New technologies, such as universal vaccines and next-generation antiviral drugs\n    - C: The development of new treatments for pandemics\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefinements were made to ensure the questions align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. No major changes were made, and the questions are now more refined and accurate."
