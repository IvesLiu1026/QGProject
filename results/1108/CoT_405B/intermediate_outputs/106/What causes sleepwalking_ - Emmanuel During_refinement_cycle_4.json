    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) What percentage of people are estimated to sleepwalk at least once in their lives?\n    - A: 5%\n    - B: 10%\n    - C: 18%\n    - D: 25%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which stage of non-REM sleep is sleepwalking typically associated with?\n    - A: Light-wave sleep\n    - B: REM sleep\n    - C: Slow-wave sleep\n    - D: Deep-wave sleep\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the state of the prefrontal cortex during a sleepwalking episode?\n    - A: It becomes more active\n    - B: It remains unchanged\n    - C: It is inactive, while other parts of the brain are active\n    - D: It is damaged\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) Why might sleepwalking be more common in children?\n    - A: Due to the increased amount of REM sleep in children\n    - B: Due to the decreased amount of slow-wave sleep in children\n    - C: Due to the developing brain areas that control the transition between sleep and wakefulness\n    - D: Due to the increased amount of stress in children\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What safety measures can help prevent harm during sleepwalking episodes?\n    - A: Keeping sharp objects in a designated area\n    - B: Hiding sharp objects, securing windows, and installing door alarms\n    - C: Taking medication to prevent sleepwalking\n    - D: Ignoring the sleepwalking episodes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) (Removed due to duplication with question 5)\n\n7) How should a family member or caregiver respond if they encounter a sleepwalker?\n    - A: Try to wake the sleepwalker up\n    - B: Gently guide the sleepwalker back to bed and ensure their safety\n    - C: Leave the sleepwalker alone\n    - D: Call for emergency services\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the main difference between sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder?\n    - A: Sleepwalking occurs during REM sleep, while REM sleep behavior disorder occurs during non-REM sleep\n    - B: Sleepwalking is a benign condition, while REM sleep behavior disorder is a serious condition\n    - C: Sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder are distinct conditions with different underlying mechanisms\n    - D: Sleepwalking is more common in children, while REM sleep behavior disorder is more common in adults\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How do sleepwalkers differ from wakeful individuals in terms of their actions?\n    - A: Sleepwalkers have more control over their actions\n    - B: Sleepwalkers have less control over their actions\n    - C: Sleepwalkers have the same amount of control over their actions\n    - D: Sleepwalkers are more aware of their actions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What may contribute to the development of sleepwalking behaviors?\n    - A: Genetics\n    - B: Brain development\n    - C: Disruptions in sleep patterns, such as those caused by sleep disorders or stress\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What does the brain's ability to perform complex tasks without deliberate control during sleepwalking episodes suggest?\n    - A: That there is a clear distinction between wakefulness and sleep\n    - B: That there may be a continuum between wakefulness and sleep\n    - C: That sleepwalking is a benign condition\n    - D: That sleepwalking is a serious condition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the current understanding of the effectiveness of treatments for sleepwalking?\n    - A: Current treatments are highly effective\n    - B: Current treatments are somewhat effective\n    - C: Current treatments are not well understood, and more research is needed\n    - D: Current treatments are ineffective\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n13) Why is it essential to take safety measures to prevent harm during sleepwalking episodes?\n    - A: Because sleepwalking is a benign condition\n    - B: Because sleepwalking can pose significant risks\n    - C: Because sleepwalking is a rare condition\n    - D: Because sleepwalking is a common condition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-13. However, I suggest rephrasing question 11 to improve clarity:\n\n11) What does the brain's ability to perform complex tasks during sleepwalking episodes imply about the relationship between wakefulness and sleep?\n    - A: That there is a clear distinction between wakefulness and sleep\n    - B: That there may be a continuum between wakefulness and sleep\n    - C: That sleepwalking is a benign condition\n    - D: That sleepwalking is a serious condition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nAdditionally, consider adding more questions to cover other key concepts in the transcript, such as the role of central pattern generators, the characteristics of sleep terrors, and the importance of healthy sleep habits in preventing sleepwalking episodes."
