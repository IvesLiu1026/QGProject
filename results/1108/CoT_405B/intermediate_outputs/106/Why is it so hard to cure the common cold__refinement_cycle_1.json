Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What was the outcome of the 1957 rhinovirus vaccine trial conducted by William Price?\n    - A: The vaccine provided long-term protection against all subtypes of rhinovirus.\n    - B: The vaccine showed no protection against rhinovirus.\n    - C: The vaccine provided protection against one or a few subtypes of rhinovirus, but not all.\n    - D: The vaccine trial was inconclusive due to a small sample size.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is it challenging to create a broadly protective vaccine against rhinovirus?\n    - A: Rhinovirus has a low mutation rate.\n    - B: Rhinovirus has multiple subtypes, making it difficult to create a vaccine that provides broad protection.\n    - C: Rhinovirus is not a common cause of the common cold.\n    - D: Rhinovirus is easily treatable with antiviral drugs.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary reason why viruses can cause the same illness despite being from different families?\n    - A: Viruses can only invade the body through a few specific routes.\n    - B: Viruses have similar genetic codes.\n    - C: Viruses can only infect people with weakened immune systems.\n    - D: Viruses are highly contagious.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is the name of the CRISPR system that has shown promise as an antiviral agent against coronavirus and influenza?\n    - A: PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in human cells)\n    - B: CRISPR-Cas9\n    - C: mRNA-CRISPR\n    - D: Antiviral CRISPR System (ACS)\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) Why did the pleconaril treatment fail in some patients?\n    - A: The treatment was not effective against the common cold.\n    - B: The virus mutated quickly and became resistant to the treatment.\n    - C: The treatment had severe side effects.\n    - D: The treatment was not administered correctly.\n[Correct answer]: B"
