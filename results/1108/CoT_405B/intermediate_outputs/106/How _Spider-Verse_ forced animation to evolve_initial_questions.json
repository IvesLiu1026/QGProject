A: To create a stylized and imaginative world\n    - B: To replicate real-world physics of light, shadow, reflection, and more\n    - C: To produce a final image with minimal inputs\n    - D: To enhance the animation with 2D elements\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which film is known for using non-photorealistic rendering to break away from the traditional physically based rendering look?\n    - A: \"Toy Story\" (1995)\n    - B: \"Frozen\" (2013)\n    - C: \"Into the Spider-Verse\" (2017)\n    - D: \"The Lion King\" (2019)\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1) What is the concept of the \"Pixar look\" in animation?\n    - A: A stylized and imaginative world with non-photorealistic rendering\n    - B: A highly realistic and detailed style that replicates the real world\n    - C: A blend of traditional animation and computer-generated imagery (CGI)\n    - D: A minimalist approach to animation with simple textures and lighting\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary aim of using physically based rendering in animation?\n    - A: To create a stylized and imaginative world\n    - B: To replicate the real world and create a realistic experience for the viewer\n    - C: To enhance the animation with 2D elements and variable frame rates\n    - D: To produce a final image with minimal inputs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application:**\n\n1) How can non-photorealistic rendering be applied in animation?\n    - A: Only in comic book-inspired visuals\n    - B: Only in painterly landscapes\n    - C: In a wide range of stylized and imaginative worlds\n    - D: Only in traditional animation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What technique can be used to produce stylized results in rendering?\n    - A: Combining data passes with custom tweaks\n    - B: Using physically based rendering with minimal inputs\n    - C: Enhancing the animation with 2D elements only\n    - D: Producing a final image with variable frame rates only\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the \"Pixar look\" and the trend towards more stylized animation?\n    - A: They are similar in their emphasis on realism\n    - B: They are contrasting, with the former emphasizing realism and the latter embracing imagination and creativity\n    - C: They are unrelated, with the former focusing on traditional animation and the latter on computer-generated imagery (CGI)\n    - D: They are identical, with both emphasizing the use of physically based rendering\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why was non-photorealistic rendering used in \"Into the Spider-Verse\"?\n    - A: To create a realistic and immersive experience for the viewer\n    - B: To break away from the traditional physically based rendering look and create a more stylized and comic book-inspired visual style\n    - C: To enhance the animation with 2D elements and variable frame rates only\n    - D: To produce a final image with minimal inputs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1) What can be achieved by combining physically based rendering and non-photorealistic rendering techniques in animation?\n    - A: A stylized and imaginative world with limited creativity\n    - B: A highly realistic and detailed style that replicates the real world\n    - C: A wide range of stylized and imaginative worlds\n    - D: A minimalist approach to animation with simple textures and lighting\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How can the incorporation of 2D elements and variable frame rates be used in animation?\n    - A: To create a more realistic and immersive experience for the viewer\n    - B: To enhance the animation with physically based rendering only\n    - C: To create a more dynamic and stylized look, blurring the lines between traditional animation and computer-generated imagery (CGI)\n    - D: To produce a final image with minimal inputs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1) How can the use of non-photorealistic rendering in \"Into the Spider-Verse\" be evaluated?\n    - A: As a conservative and traditional approach to animation\n    - B: As a bold and innovative approach to animation, which has inspired other studios to experiment with new techniques and styles\n    - C: As a limiting factor in animation, restricting the imagination and creativity of animators\n    - D: As a minimalist approach to animation with simple textures and lighting\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the impact of the trend towards more stylized animation on the animation industry?\n    - A: It restricts the imagination and creativity of animators\n    - B: It allows animators to create more imaginative and creative worlds that are not bound by the constraints of realism\n    - C: It has no impact on the animation industry\n    - D: It leads to a more realistic and immersive experience for the viewer\n[Correct answer]: B"
