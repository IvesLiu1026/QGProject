A: Hemagglutinin mutations have no effect on the immune system\n    - B: Hemagglutinin mutations make the immune system more effective\n    - C: Hemagglutinin mutations make the immune system less effective over time\n    - D: Hemagglutinin mutations have a random effect on the immune system\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the main difference between antigenic drift and antigenic shift?\n    - A: Antigenic drift occurs when two different viral genomes recombine, while antigenic shift occurs when a single viral genome mutates\n    - B: Antigenic drift occurs when a single viral genome mutates, while antigenic shift occurs when two different viral genomes recombine\n    - C: Antigenic drift occurs when the immune system becomes more effective, while antigenic shift occurs when the immune system becomes less effective\n    - D: Antigenic drift occurs when the immune system becomes less effective, while antigenic shift occurs when the immune system becomes more effective\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**:\n1) How can the concepts of conserved regions and ferritin nanoparticles be combined to create a universal flu vaccine?\n    - A: By using conserved regions as targets for strain-specific vaccines and ferritin nanoparticles to present viral proteins and stimulate an immune response\n    - B: By using conserved regions as targets for universal vaccines and ferritin nanoparticles to present viral proteins and stimulate an immune response\n    -
