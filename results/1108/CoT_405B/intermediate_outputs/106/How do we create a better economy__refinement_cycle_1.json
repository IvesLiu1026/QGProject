A: To ensure everyone has access to basic resources and to maximize economic growth.\n    - B: To ensure everyone has access to basic resources and to avoid overshooting the planet's ecological limits.\n    - C: To maximize economic growth and to minimize income inequality.\n    - D: To minimize income inequality and to avoid overshooting the planet's ecological limits.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can the doughnut model be applied to low-income countries, according to Kate Raworth?\n    -

A: The doughnut model prioritizes economic growth, while traditional models prioritize sustainability.\n    - B: The doughnut model prioritizes balance and sustainability, while traditional models prioritize economic growth.\n    - C: The doughnut model prioritizes social welfare, while traditional models prioritize economic growth.\n    - D: The doughnut model prioritizes environmental protection, while traditional models prioritize economic growth.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What two concepts does the doughnut model combine to create a new understanding of economic progress?\n    - A: Social foundation and ecological limits.\n    - B: Economic growth and environmental degradation.\n    - C: Human well-being and material wealth.\n    - D: Sustainability and community engagement.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is synthesized with the concept of human well-being in the doughnut model?\n    -

B: They prioritize sustainability and human well-being over economic growth.\n    - C: They prioritize social welfare and community engagement over economic growth.\n    - D: They prioritize environmental protection and ecological limits over economic growth.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is the justification for the doughnut model presented by Kate Raworth?\n    - A: It prioritizes economic growth and material wealth.\n    - B: It prioritizes balance and sustainability.\n    - C: It prioritizes social connections and community engagement.\n    - D: It prioritizes environmental protection and ecological limits.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12. However, I suggest considering the addition of new questions to further assess understanding of the doughnut model and its applications."
