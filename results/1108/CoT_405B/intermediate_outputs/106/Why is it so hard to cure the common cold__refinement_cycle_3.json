    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript and initial questions, I've refined the questions for clarity and conciseness, ensuring the distractors are plausible but incorrect and the correct answers are accurate.\n\n1) What was the outcome of William Price's 1957 rhinovirus vaccine trial?\n    - A: The vaccine provided long-term protection against all subtypes of rhinovirus.\n    - B: The vaccine showed no protection against rhinovirus in the initial trial.\n    - C: The vaccine provided protection against one or a few subtypes of rhinovirus, but not all.\n    - D: The vaccine trial was inconclusive due to a small sample size.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined for clarity, but no significant changes needed.\n\n2) Why is it challenging to create a broadly protective vaccine against rhinovirus?\n    - A: Rhinovirus has a low mutation rate, making it an easy target for vaccines.\n    - B: Rhinovirus has multiple subtypes, making it difficult to create a vaccine that provides broad protection.\n    - C: The immune system's response to rhinovirus is not well understood, hindering vaccine development.\n    - D: Rhinovirus is highly contagious, making it difficult to develop an effective vaccine.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined distractor C to make it more plausible but incorrect.\n\n3) Why can different viruses cause the same illness, such as the common cold?\n    - A: Viruses can only invade the body through a few specific routes, triggering similar immune responses.\n    - B: Viruses have similar genetic codes, making them difficult to distinguish.\n    - C: The immune system's response to different viruses is identical, resulting in similar symptoms.\n    - D: Viruses target the same cells and tissues, leading to similar illnesses.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined distractors C and D to make them more plausible but incorrect.\n\n4) What is the name of the CRISPR system that has shown promise as an antiviral agent against coronavirus and influenza?\n    - A: PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in human cells)\n    - B: CRISPR-Cas9\n    - C: CRISPR-Cas13\n    - D: Antiviral CRISPR System (ACS)\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined distractor C to make it more plausible but incorrect, as CRISPR-Cas13 is a real CRISPR system, but not the one mentioned in the transcript.\n\n5) Why did the pleconaril treatment fail in some patients?\n    - A: The treatment was not effective against the common cold.\n    - B: The virus mutated quickly and became resistant to the treatment.\n    - C: The treatment had severe side effects, leading to discontinuation.\n    - D: The treatment was not administered correctly, reducing its efficacy.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo significant changes needed.\n\nAdditional questions to consider:\n\n6) What is the primary reason why people with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to serious illnesses from common cold viruses?\n    - A: Their immune system is unable to produce antibodies against the virus.\n    - B: Their immune system is unable to trigger an inflammatory response to the virus.\n    - C: Their immune system is unable to prevent the virus from replicating and spreading.\n    - D: Their immune system is unable to recognize the virus.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the main advantage of using CRISPR as an antiviral agent?\n    - A: CRISPR can target specific viral genes, reducing the risk of off-target effects.\n    - B: CRISPR can provide long-term protection against viral infections.\n    - C: CRISPR can be used to treat a wide range of viral infections.\n    - D: CRISPR can be used to prevent viral infections from occurring in the first place.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nThese additional questions can help assess the understanding of the topics discussed in the transcript."
