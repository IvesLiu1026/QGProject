A: 50\n    - B: 60\n    - C: 79\n    - D: 90\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What occurs when a superior planet reaches its opposition?\n    - A: It rises in the east at sunrise and sets in the west at sunset.\n    - B: It rises in the east at sunset, reaches its highest point in the sky around midnight, and sets in the west at dawn.\n    - C: It rises in the west at sunset and sets in the east at sunrise.\n    - D: It rises in the west at sunrise and sets in the east at sunset.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) Why does Jupiter's closest approach to Earth occur?\n    - A: Because Earth and Jupiter orbit the Sun in perfect circles.\n    - B: Because Earth and Jupiter do not orbit the Sun in perfect circles, causing the planets to pass each other at different distances throughout the year.\n    - C: Because Jupiter's orbit is much larger than Earth's.\n    -
