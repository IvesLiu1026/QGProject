    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I've refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In South Africa, what percentage of the country's wealth is owned by the richest one-tenth of 1% of the population?\n    - A: 10%\n    - B: 20%\n    - C: Almost 30%\n    - D: 40%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the typical after-tax Gini index in developed countries today?\n    - A: 0.1\n    - B: 0.3\n    - C: 0.5\n    - D: 0.7\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is a limitation of the Gini index as a measure of economic inequality?\n    - A: It only measures income inequality, not wealth inequality.\n    - B: It does not provide information on how income and wealth are distributed across demographics.\n    - C: It is only applicable to developed countries.\n    - D: It does not account for the impact of taxes on inequality.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make option D more plausible.\n\n4) What is one way that governments can reduce economic inequality in capitalist countries?\n    - A: Implementing regressive taxation\n    - B: Increasing access to education and healthcare\n    - C: Reducing social transfers\n    - D: Implementing a flat tax rate\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) Which country could a government look to as an example for implementing an inheritance tax to reduce wealth inequality?\n    - A: United States\n    - B: Germany\n    - C: China\n    - D: France\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What initiative could a policymaker consider to address the digital divide in their country?\n    - A: Increasing taxes on digital technologies\n    - B: Implementing a nationwide internet shutdown\n    - C: Increasing access to the internet and digital technologies\n    - D: Implementing a digital literacy program for only a select group\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make option D more plausible.\n\n7) What is the relationship between progressive taxation and economic inequality?\n    - A: Progressive taxation increases economic inequality.\n    - B: Progressive taxation has no effect on economic inequality.\n    - C: Progressive taxation reduces economic inequality.\n    - D: The relationship between progressive taxation and economic inequality is dependent on the tax rate.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make option D more plausible.\n\n8) What is the impact of inheritance taxes on wealth inequality?\n    - A: Inheritance taxes increase wealth inequality.\n    - B: Inheritance taxes have no effect on wealth inequality.\n    - C: Inheritance taxes reduce wealth inequality.\n    - D: The impact of inheritance taxes on wealth inequality is dependent on the tax rate.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make option D more plausible.\n\n9) What combination of policies could create a comprehensive strategy for reducing economic inequality?\n    - A: Progressive taxation, social transfers, and reduced access to education and healthcare\n    - B: Progressive taxation, social transfers, and increased access to education and healthcare\n    - C: Progressive taxation, reduced social transfers, and increased access to education and healthcare\n    - D: Regressive taxation, increased social transfers, and increased access to education and healthcare\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make option C more plausible.\n\n10) What could further enhance efforts to reduce economic inequality?\n    - A: Integrating policies to address the digital divide and extreme wealth\n    - B: Ignoring the digital divide and extreme wealth\n    - C: Focusing solely on progressive taxation\n    - D: Implementing a one-time wealth tax\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make option D more plausible.\n\n11) What is a characteristic of power and wealth in societies?\n    - A: They are self-limiting.\n    - B: They are self-reinforcing.\n    - C: They are unrelated.\n    - D: They are influenced by external factors only.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make option D more plausible.\n\n12) What is a potential consequence of not addressing economic inequality?\n    - A: Reduced poverty and increased economic growth.\n    - B: Increased social mobility and reduced wealth disparities.\n    - C: Threats to the fabric of democracy.\n    - D: Decreased economic competition and innovation due to government intervention.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make option D more plausible.\n\nThese refined questions should be more effective in assessing understanding of the key concepts and promoting critical thinking."
