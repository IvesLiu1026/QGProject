    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of their waking hours do humans spend daydreaming?\n    - A: A quarter to a third\n    - B: A third to half\n    - C: Half to two-thirds\n    - D: Two-thirds to three-quarters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which brain area, still developing in teenagers, is involved in executive function and decision-making?\n    - A: Prefrontal cortex\n    - B: Cerebellum\n    - C: Hippocampus\n    - D: Amygdala\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) What is the primary function of the default mode network in the human brain?\n    - A: To facilitate logical thinking and problem-solving\n    - B: To enable mind-wandering, revisiting memories, and thinking about plans and hopes\n    - C: To regulate emotions and manage stress\n    - D: To control motor functions and coordination\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the relationship between mind-wandering and productivity?\n    - A: Mind-wandering is always unproductive and distressing\n    - B: Mind-wandering can be unproductive or distressing, but also neutral or positive\n    - C: Mind-wandering is always neutral and has no impact on productivity\n    - D: Mind-wandering is always positive and productive\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can understanding the role of daydreaming in the brain benefit individuals?\n    - A: By helping them avoid mind-wandering and stay focused on tasks\n    - B: By encouraging them to make time for mind-wandering and relaxation\n    - C: By enabling them to think more logically and solve problems more efficiently\n    - D: By allowing them to control their emotions and manage stress more effectively\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can parents and educators learn from knowing that teenagers are capable of thinking through problems and goals?\n    - A: That teenagers need more structure and guidance\n    - B: That teenagers should be given more space to think and reflect\n    - C: That teenagers are not capable of independent thought\n    - D: That teenagers should focus on developing their logical thinking skills\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the executive network and default mode network in creative thinking?\n    - A: The executive network is the primary driver of creative thinking, while the default mode network is secondary\n    - B: The default mode network is the primary driver of creative thinking, while the executive network is secondary\n    - C: The executive network and default mode network work together to facilitate creative thinking\n    - D: The executive network and default mode network are mutually exclusive and cannot work together\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What does the comparison between the brain's activity during daydreaming and its activity during tasks or thinking reveal?\n    - A: That the brain is more active during daydreaming than during tasks or thinking\n    - B: That the brain is less active during daydreaming than during tasks or thinking\n    - C: That the brain's activity during daydreaming is similar to its activity during tasks or thinking\n    - D: That the brain's activity during daydreaming is distinct from its activity during tasks or thinking\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What can be gained by combining the concepts of the executive network and default mode network?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the logical thinking process\n    - B: A deeper understanding of the creative process\n    - C: A deeper understanding of the emotional regulation process\n    - D: A deeper understanding of the motor control process\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What new insights can be gained by integrating the idea of daydreaming as a valuable cognitive process?\n    - A: Insights into the nature of intelligence and productivity\n    - B: Insights into the nature of emotional regulation and well-being\n    - C: Insights into the nature of logical thinking and problem-solving\n    - D: Insights into the nature of motor control and coordination\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How can the value of daydreaming in daily life be assessed?\n    - A: By evaluating its impact on productivity and well-being\n    - B: By evaluating its impact on emotional regulation and stress management\n    - C: By evaluating its impact on logical thinking and problem-solving\n    - D: By evaluating its impact on motor control and coordination\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is required to justify the importance of making time for mind-wandering and relaxation?\n    - A: Evaluating the benefits of the executive network's activity\n    - B: Evaluating the benefits of the default mode network's activity\n    - C: Evaluating the benefits of logical thinking and problem-solving\n    - D: Evaluating the benefits of emotional regulation and stress management\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
