A nuclear explosion equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT can create a fireball capable of decimating a few city blocks and a shockwave damaging buildings several kilometers away.\n3. The shockwave of energy travels several kilometers beyond the fireball's radius in the first few seconds.\n4. Radioactive particles called fallout are produced when unstable atoms created by nuclear fission mix with debris in the atmosphere.\n5. Fallout emits ionizing radiation, capable of causing cell damage, radiation burns, radiation sickness, cancer, and death.\n6. The most hazardous fallout particles are the heaviest and sink through the air, collecting on streets and rooftops.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The scientifically supported plan of action to save lives in the event of a nuclear explosion involves getting inside a sturdy building to protect against the shockwave, heat, and radiation.\n2. The same buildings that offer protection from the blast are also effective at guarding against fallout.\n3. Radiation is reduced as it travels through space and mass, making thick layers of steel, concrete, and packed earth effective at offering protection.\n4. Staying inside for 24 hours can dramatically improve the odds of avoiding the most serious effects of radiation.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. In the event of a nuclear explosion, individuals should seek shelter in a sturdy building, ideally in the center or basement, to protect against the shockwave, heat, and radiation.\n2. If someone is caught in the fallout, they should remove their shoes and outer layers, wash any exposed skin, and store the contaminated clothing far away.\n3. If the shelter is poor or someone inside needs urgent medical attention, they should try seeking outside help after an hour.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect connections)**\n\n1. The relationship between the fireball's radius and the shockwave's range: the shockwave travels several kilometers beyond the fireball's radius.\n2. The contrast between the effects of the shockwave and the effects of fallout: the shockwave causes immediate damage, while fallout causes long-term radiation exposure.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between nuclear fission and the production of radioactive particles: nuclear fission creates unstable atoms that mix with debris to produce fallout.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas to form new understanding)**\n\n1. The combination of getting inside a sturdy building and staying there for 24 hours can provide effective protection against both the shockwave and fallout.\n2. The use of radios to receive emergency information from first responders can help individuals determine the safest course of action after a nuclear explosion.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. The effectiveness of the \"Get Inside, Stay Inside, and Stay Tuned\" plan in saving lives in the event of a nuclear explosion.\n2. The justification for relying on straightforward protective measures, such as getting inside a sturdy building, in the face of a catastrophic event like a nuclear explosion.\n3. The critique of the assumption that electric power, cell service, and Internet would be down, but most radios would likely survive."
