    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the two types of attention, according to the speaker?\n    - A: Selective and divided attention\n    - B: Overt and covert attention\n    - C: Conscious and subconscious attention\n    - D: Voluntary and involuntary attention\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which part of the brain is responsible for higher cognitive functions and acts as a filter for information?\n    - A: Parietal lobe\n    - B: Frontal lobe\n    - C: Temporal lobe\n    - D: Occipital lobe\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the role of the brain's filtering ability in attention?\n    - A: To focus on multiple stimuli simultaneously\n    - B: To filter out irrelevant information and focus on relevant information\n    - C: To process visual and auditory information separately\n    - D: To control voluntary movements\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the main goal of the speaker's research on brain patterns and attention?\n    - A: To develop new treatments for neurological disorders\n    - B: To understand the neural mechanisms of attention and develop models for computers\n    - C: To improve cognitive functions in healthy individuals\n    - D: To develop new diagnostic tools for ADHD\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can the speaker's research on brain patterns and attention be applied to help people with ADHD?\n    - A: By developing new medications to treat ADHD\n    - B: By developing therapies that use brain-machine interfaces to train attention\n    - C: By creating educational programs to raise awareness about ADHD\n    - D: By developing assistive devices for people with physical disabilities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential application of brain-machine interfaces in assistive technology?\n    - A: Developing prosthetic limbs for amputees\n    - B: Creating computers that can communicate for people who cannot speak\n    - C: Developing hearing aids for people with hearing loss\n    - D: Creating wheelchairs that can be controlled by brain signals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between overt and covert attention?\n    - A: Overt attention involves moving one's eyes towards something, while covert attention involves paying attention without moving one's eyes\n    - B: Overt attention involves paying attention without moving one's eyes, while covert attention involves moving one's eyes towards something\n    - C: Overt attention involves focusing on multiple stimuli simultaneously, while covert attention involves focusing on a single stimulus\n    - D: Overt attention involves processing visual information, while covert attention involves processing auditory information\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) How do people with ADHD differ from those without ADHD in terms of their ability to inhibit distractions?\n    - A: People with ADHD are better at inhibiting distractions than those without ADHD\n    - B: People with ADHD have difficulty inhibiting distractions, while those without ADHD can inhibit distractions easily\n    - C: People with ADHD and those without ADHD have similar abilities to inhibit distractions\n    - D: People with ADHD can inhibit distractions, but only with the help of medication\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a potential application of combining brain-machine interfaces with gaming technology?\n    - A: Developing games that can diagnose neurological disorders\n    - B: Creating games that can train attention and cognitive functions in people with ADHD\n    - C: Developing games that can control prosthetic limbs\n    - D: Creating games that can simulate real-world situations for people with physical disabilities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) How can the effectiveness of the speaker's research in developing therapies for people with ADHD be evaluated?\n    - A: By conducting randomized controlled trials to test the efficacy of the therapies\n    - B: By collecting anecdotal evidence from people who have used the therapies\n    - C: By comparing the results of the speaker's research to existing treatments for ADHD\n    - D: By evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the therapies\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript. I also refined the language and options for some questions to improve clarity and concision.\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for the remaining questions."
