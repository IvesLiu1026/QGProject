Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how long ago did Neanderthals coexist with modern humans?\n    - A: 100,000 years ago\n    - B: 50,000 years ago\n    - C: 20,000 years ago\n    - D: 10,000 years ago\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of genes in modern humans outside sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to have come from Neanderthals?\n    - A: 1-2%\n    - B: 1-4%\n    - C: 5-10%\n    - D: 10-20%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the significance of the FOXP2 gene in human evolution?\n    - A: It determines eye color\n    - B: It is essential for language development\n    - C: It affects height\n    - D: It influences skin color\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is believed to have occurred between Neanderthals and modern humans, resulting in the presence of Neanderthal DNA in modern human genomes?\n    - A: Genetic drift\n    - B: Mutation\n    - C: Gene flow\n    - D: Interbreeding\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) A team of researchers is studying the physical adaptations of a newly discovered human species. Which environment would they most likely associate with a species having a big brow ridge, huge nose, and short forearms and shins?\n    - A: Desert\n    - B: Tropical forest\n    - C: Cold northern climate\n    - D: Mountainous region\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What example would a linguist most likely use to support the importance of language in human evolution?\n    - A: The development of agriculture\n    - B: The emergence of complex social structures\n    - C: The presence of the FOXP2 gene in Neanderthals\n    - D: The invention of writing\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) Which comparison would be most relevant in highlighting the adaptations of Neanderthals to their environment?\n    - A: Neanderthals vs. modern humans living in tropical climates\n    - B: Neanderthals vs. modern humans living in cold northern climates\n    - C: Neanderthals vs. other extinct human species\n    - D: Neanderthals vs. non-human primates\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the primary difference between the initial misconceptions about Neanderthals and the current understanding of their sophistication and intelligence?\n    - A: Brain size\n    - B: Physical characteristics\n    - C: Tool use\n    - D: Capacity for complex thought and behavior\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What would be the most comprehensive approach to understanding the biology and behavior of Neanderthals?\n    - A: Analyzing their physical characteristics alone\n    - B: Studying their genetic makeup alone\n    - C: Examining their fossil record alone\n    - D: Combining their physical, genetic, and fossil evidence\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) Which integration would provide the most complete understanding of human evolution?\n    - A: Combining the study of human species with the concept of genetic drift\n    - B: Integrating the concept of evolution with the study of human species, including Neanderthals\n    - C: Merging the ideas of language and culture\n    - D: Considering the implications of Neanderthal DNA in modern human genomes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the primary critique of the initial misconceptions about Neanderthals?\n    - A: They were based on incomplete data\n    - B: They were influenced by cultural biases\n    - C: They underestimated Neanderthal intelligence and behavior\n    - D: They overestimated Neanderthal physical abilities\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the significance of the FOXP2 gene in evaluating human intelligence?\n    - A: It determines intelligence quotient (IQ)\n    - B: It is a marker for language development\n    - C: It affects cognitive abilities\n    - D: It has no impact on human intelligence\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
