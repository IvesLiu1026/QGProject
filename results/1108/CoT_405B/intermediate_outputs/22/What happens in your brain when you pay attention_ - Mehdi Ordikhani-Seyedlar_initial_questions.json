    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n1) What are the two types of attention?\n    - A: Selective and divided attention\n    - B: Overt and covert attention\n    - C: Conscious and subconscious attention\n    - D: Voluntary and involuntary attention\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which part of the brain is responsible for higher cognitive functions and acts as a filter for information?\n    - A: Parietal lobe\n    - B: Frontal lobe\n    - C: Temporal lobe\n    - D: Occipital lobe\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension**\n1) What is the role of the brain's filtering ability in attention?\n    - A: To focus on multiple stimuli simultaneously\n    - B: To filter out irrelevant information and focus on relevant information\n    - C: To process visual and auditory information separately\n    - D: To control voluntary movements\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the main goal of the speaker's research on brain patterns and attention?\n    - A: To develop new treatments for neurological disorders\n    - B: To understand the neural mechanisms of attention and develop models for computers\n    - C: To improve cognitive functions in healthy individuals\n    - D: To develop new diagnostic tools for ADHD\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n1) How can the speaker's research on brain patterns and attention be applied to help people with ADHD?\n    - A: By developing new medications to treat ADHD\n    - B: By developing therapies that use brain-machine interfaces to train attention\n    - C: By creating educational programs to raise awareness about ADHD\n    - D: By developing assistive devices for people with physical disabilities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a potential application of brain-machine interfaces in assistive technology?\n    - A: Developing prosthetic limbs for amputees\n    - B: Creating computers that can communicate for people who cannot speak\n    - C: Developing hearing aids for people with hearing loss\n    - D: Creating wheelchairs that can be controlled by brain signals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the relationship between overt and covert attention?\n    - A: Overt attention involves moving one's eyes towards something, while covert attention involves paying attention without moving one's eyes\n    - B: Overt attention involves paying attention without moving one's eyes, while covert attention involves moving one's eyes towards something\n    - C: Overt attention involves focusing on multiple stimuli simultaneously, while covert attention involves focusing on a single stimulus\n    - D: Overt attention involves processing visual information, while covert attention involves processing auditory information\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) How do people with ADHD differ from those without ADHD in terms of their ability to inhibit distractions?\n    - A: People with ADHD are better at inhibiting distractions than those without ADHD\n    - B: People with ADHD have difficulty inhibiting distractions, while those without ADHD can inhibit distractions easily\n    - C: People with ADHD and those without ADHD have similar abilities to inhibit distractions\n    - D: People with ADHD can inhibit distractions, but only with the help of medication\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) How can the speaker's research on brain patterns and attention be combined with computer technology to develop innovative assistive devices?\n    - A: By developing brain-machine interfaces that can control prosthetic limbs\n    - B: By creating computers that can communicate for people who cannot speak\n    - C: By developing therapeutic games that use brain signals to train attention\n    - D: By creating virtual reality environments that can simulate real-world situations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a potential application of combining brain-machine interfaces with gaming technology?\n    - A: Developing games that can diagnose neurological disorders\n    - B: Creating games that can train attention and cognitive functions in people with ADHD\n    - C: Developing games that can control prosthetic limbs\n    - D: Creating games that can simulate real-world situations for people with physical disabilities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) What is a potential critique of the speaker's claim that brain-machine interfaces can be used to develop assistive devices for people with cognitive impairments?\n    - A: The technology is too expensive to be widely available\n    - B: The technology is not advanced enough to be effective\n    - C: The technology raises ethical concerns about the potential risks and benefits\n    - D: The technology is not necessary, as existing assistive devices are sufficient\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How can the effectiveness of the speaker's research in developing therapies for people with ADHD be evaluated?\n    - A: By conducting randomized controlled trials to test the efficacy of the therapies\n    - B: By collecting anecdotal evidence from people who have used the therapies\n    - C: By comparing the results of the speaker's research to existing treatments for ADHD\n    - D: By evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the therapies\n[Correct answer]: A"
