A black and white cat, later nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, survived the sinking and went on to serve as a ship cat on three more vessels.\n3. The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to over 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent.\n4. The Neolithic era saw the emergence of farming and the storage of excess grain, which attracted rodents and their predator, Felis silvestris lybica.\n5. The wildcat found across North Africa and Southwest Asia was fast, fierce, and carnivorous, with a size and appearance similar to today's domestic cats.\n6. The Egyptians domesticated their own local cats, which became important to Egyptian religious culture.\n7. Most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1. The relationship between humans and cats was beneficial, with cats providing pest control in exchange for food and shelter.\n2. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested granaries drew in wildcats, which learned to tolerate the presence of humans and other cats.\n3. Cats became essential sailing companions due to their ability to control vermin on ships.\n4. The Egyptians revered cats for their ability to dispatch venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats.\n5. The domestication of cats led to changes in their behavior, making them more social and docile.\n\n**Application**:\n\n1. The use of cats as ship cats to control vermin on vessels is an example of how humans have utilized cats for their skills.\n2. The ability of cats to hunt and control pests can be applied to modern-day farming and pest control.\n3. The relationship between humans and cats can be seen in the way that cats are used as companions and service animals today.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. The relationship between humans and cats is mutually beneficial, with cats providing pest control and companionship in exchange for food and shelter.\n2. The domestication of cats led to changes in their behavior, but they remain genetically similar to their wild ancestors.\n3. The contrast between the independent nature of cats and their ability to form close bonds with humans is a complex aspect of their behavior.\n4. The cause-and-effect connection between the emergence of farming and the domestication of cats highlights the impact of human activity on the natural world.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1. The combination of the domestication of cats and their use as ship cats highlights the adaptability and usefulness of cats in various contexts.\n2. The intersection of human and cat history reveals a complex and multifaceted relationship that has evolved over thousands of years.\n3. The comparison between the domestication of cats and dogs reveals differences in the way that humans have interacted with and influenced the behavior of these animals.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1. The judgment that cats are \"wild animals\" and \"fierce hunters\" that don't see humans as their keepers is a subjective interpretation of their behavior.\n2. The critique that humans have done little to alter the natural behaviors of cats raises questions about the ethics of animal domestication and the impact of human activity on the natural world.\n3. The justification for the use of cats as companions and service animals is based on their ability to provide affection and assistance, but also raises questions about their welfare and treatment."
