Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many billion years ago did the formation of our solar system begin?\n    - A: 3.6 billion years ago\n    - B: 4.6 billion years ago\n    - C: 5.6 billion years ago\n    - D: 6.6 billion years ago\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the term for the threshold at which a dense cloud of gas and dust collapses in on itself?\n    - A: Jeans force\n    - B: van der Waals force\n    - C: Jeans mass\n    - D: Gravitational threshold\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the first step in the formation of stars and planets?\n    - A: The collapse of a dense cloud of gas and dust\n    - B: The formation of a protoplanetary disk\n    - C: The growth of dust clusters through electrostatic forces\n    - D: The cementing of chondrules together inside larger rocks\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) Why is the van der Waals force insufficient to explain the continued growth of dust clusters?\n    - A: The force becomes stronger as clusters grow\n    - B: The force becomes weaker as clusters grow\n    - C: The force remains constant as clusters grow\n    - D: The force is not affected by the size of the clusters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can understanding the formation of stars and planets help us appreciate?\n    - A: The uniqueness of our own planet and the conditions that allow for life\n    - B: The behavior of black holes\n    - C: The properties of dark matter\n    - D: The formation of galaxies\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) How can the study of cosmic dust bunnies inform our understanding of the universe?\n    - A: It can help us understand the formation of galaxies\n    - B: It can help us understand the early solar system and the formation of planets\n    - C: It can help us understand the behavior of comets\n    - D: It can help us understand the properties of dark matter\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the van der Waals force and the size of dust clusters?\n    - A: The force becomes stronger as clusters grow\n    - B: The force becomes weaker as clusters grow\n    - C: The force remains constant as clusters grow\n    - D: The force is not affected by the size of the clusters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the role of chondrules in the formation of planets?\n    - A: The formation of chondrules leads to the formation of smaller planets\n    - B: The formation of chondrules leads to the formation of larger planets\n    - C: The formation of chondrules is a necessary step in the formation of planets\n    - D: The formation of chondrules is not related to the formation of planets\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How do electrostatic forces and gravity contribute to the growth of dust clusters and the formation of planets?\n    - A: Electrostatic forces hold dust clusters together, while gravity holds larger rocks together\n    - B: Electrostatic forces and gravity work together to hold dust clusters and larger rocks together\n    - C: Electrostatic forces are not necessary for the growth of dust clusters and the formation of planets\n    - D: Gravity is the only force necessary for the growth of dust clusters and the formation of planets\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is the proposed mechanism by which dust can help hold chondrules together?\n    - A: The Velcro-like properties of dust and electrostatic forces work together to hold chondrules together\n    - B: The Velcro-like properties of dust are not necessary for the formation of larger rocks\n    - C: Electrostatic forces are the only force necessary for the formation of larger rocks\n    - D: The dust acts as a cementing agent\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) Are electrostatic forces sufficient to explain the formation of planets?\n    - A: Yes, electrostatic forces are sufficient to explain the formation of planets\n    - B: No, electrostatic forces are not sufficient to explain the formation of planets\n    - C: Electrostatic forces are only necessary for the formation of smaller planets\n    - D: Electrostatic forces are only necessary for the formation of larger planets\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Is the theory that dust can act like Velcro to hold chondrules together a plausible explanation for the formation of larger rocks?\n    - A: Yes, the theory is plausible and well-supported by evidence\n    - B: No, the theory is not plausible and lacks supporting evidence\n    - C: The theory is plausible, but requires further research to be confirmed\n    - D: The theory is not necessary to explain the formation of larger rocks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and conciseness, while ensuring that the correct answers remain accurate. No major changes were necessary, and the questions continue to align with the key concepts in the transcript."
