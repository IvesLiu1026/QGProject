C: Electrostatic forces are the only force necessary for the formation of larger rocks\n    - D: The Velcro-like properties of dust and electrostatic forces are mutually exclusive\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, Critique, Justification)**\n\n1) Are electrostatic forces sufficient to explain the formation of planets?\n    - A: Yes, electrostatic forces are sufficient to explain the formation of planets\n    - B: No, electrostatic forces are not sufficient to explain the formation of planets\n    - C: Electrostatic forces are only necessary for the formation of smaller planets\n    - D: Electrostatic forces are only necessary for the formation of larger planets\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Is the theory that dust can act like Velcro to hold chondrules together a plausible explanation for the formation of larger rocks?\n    - A: Yes, the theory is plausible and well-supported by evidence\n    - B: No, the theory is not plausible and lacks supporting evidence\n    - C: The theory is plausible, but requires further research to be confirmed\n    - D: The theory is not necessary to explain the formation of larger rocks\n[Correct answer]: C"
