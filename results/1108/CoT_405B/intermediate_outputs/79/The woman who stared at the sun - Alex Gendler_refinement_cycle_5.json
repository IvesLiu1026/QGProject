    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the approximate internal temperature of the sun that maintains its ongoing nuclear fusion process?\n    - A: 10 million degrees Celsius\n    - B: 15 million degrees Celsius\n    - C: 20 million degrees Celsius\n    - D: 25 million degrees Celsius\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many drawings of the sun's surface did Hisako Koyama produce over a period of 40 years?\n    - A: Over 5,000 drawings\n    - B: Over 8,000 drawings\n    - C: Over 10,000 drawings\n    - D: Over 12,000 drawings\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What was notable about Hisako Koyama's observations and sketches of the sun's surface, considering her background?\n    - A: They were inaccurate due to her lack of formal training\n    - B: They were remarkably accurate despite her having no formal training in astronomy\n    - C: They were only possible with the use of advanced technology\n    - D: They were limited to nighttime observations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What appears on the sun's surface as a result of reduced heat and light?\n    - A: Bright spots scattered across the sun's surface\n    - B: Dark spots scattered across the sun's surface\n    - C: Increased magnetic activity\n    - D: Decreased solar flares\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can be used to track solar phenomena, including volatile solar flares?\n    - A: Historical records of sunspot activity alone\n    - B: Detailed observations and sketches of the sun's surface\n    - C: Advanced computer simulations alone\n    - D: Satellite imaging alone\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How does the sun's magnetic field contribute to the formation of sunspots?\n    - A: The sun's magnetic field has no effect on sunspot formation\n    - B: The sun's magnetic field causes sunspots to form randomly\n    - C: The sun's magnetic field produces temporary concentrations of magnetic activity that inhibit the movement of molecules\n    - D: The sun's magnetic field reduces the number of sunspots\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What can understanding the sun's magnetic activity help predict and plan for?\n    - A: Solar eclipses\n    - B: Planetary alignments\n    - C: Solar flares that can disrupt communication and cause blackouts\n    - D: Changes in Earth's climate patterns\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What was the significance of Koyama's contributions to our understanding of the sun's magnetic activity and solar phenomena?\n    - A: Her contributions were insignificant and had no impact\n    - B: Her contributions were limited to understanding sunspot activity\n    - C: Her contributions helped accurately count sunspots and track their movement\n    - D: Her contributions revolutionized our understanding of the sun's magnetic activity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be achieved by combining Koyama's observations with other historical records?\n    - A: A complete understanding of the sun's internal temperature\n    - B: A reconstruction of the past 400 years of sunspot activity\n    - C: A prediction of future solar flares\n    - D: A new method for observing sunspots\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) Why is continued research into the sun's magnetic activity and its effects on Earth's atmosphere important?\n    - A: To understand the sun's internal temperature\n    - B: To predict and plan for solar flares that can disrupt communication and cause blackouts\n    - C: To develop new methods for observing sunspots\n    - D: To study the formation of sunspots\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-10."
