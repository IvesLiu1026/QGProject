In 1944, Tokyo residents experienced aerial attacks from Allied bombers.\n2. Hisako Koyama was a 28-year-old resident who used the blackouts to observe the night sky.\n3. Koyama used a telescope to project the sun's light onto a sheet of paper to sketch the sun's surface.\n4. The sun's internal temperature is roughly 15 million degrees Celsius.\n5. The sun's magnetic field is produced by charged particles in plasma.\n6. Sunspots are temporary concentrations of magnetic activity that inhibit the movement of molecules.\n7. Koyama produced over 10,000 drawings of the sun's surface over 40 years.\n8. The sun's magnetic currents follow an 11-year cycle.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. Koyama's observations and sketches of the sun's surface were remarkably accurate despite having no formal training in astronomy.\n2. The sun's magnetic field is constantly in flux, disrupting and amplifying its magnetic activity.\n3. Sunspots are dark spots scattered across the sun's surface, resulting from reduced heat and light.\n4. Koyama's contributions were valuable in accurately counting sunspots and tracking their movement.\n5. The sun's magnetic activity follows a cycle that affects the formation and movement of sunspots.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. Koyama's observations and sketches can be used to track solar phenomena, including volatile solar flares.\n2. Understanding the sun's magnetic activity can help predict and plan for solar flares that can disrupt communication and cause blackouts.\n3. Koyama's record can be used to reconstruct the past 400 years of sunspot activity from historical sources.\n4. The study of sunspots and solar activity can inform the development of strategies to protect satellites and manned space stations.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between the sun's magnetic field and the formation of sunspots.\n2. The cause-and-effect connection between the sun's magnetic activity and the movement of sunspots.\n3. The contrast between Koyama's amateur observations and her later professional work at the Tokyo Museum of Science.\n4. The impact of Koyama's contributions on our understanding of the sun's magnetic activity and solar phenomena.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. Combining Koyama's observations with other historical records to reconstruct the past 400 years of sunspot activity.\n2. Integrating our understanding of the sun's magnetic activity with the study of solar flares and their effects on Earth's atmosphere.\n3. Using Koyama's record to inform the development of new strategies for predicting and planning for solar flares.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. Assessing the significance of Koyama's contributions to our understanding of the sun's magnetic activity and solar phenomena.\n2. Evaluating the accuracy and consistency of Koyama's observations and sketches.\n3. Justifying the importance of continued research into the sun's magnetic activity and its effects on Earth's atmosphere.\n4. Critiquing the limitations of Koyama's method and the potential for future improvements in observing and tracking sunspots."
