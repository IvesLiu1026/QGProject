    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What does PTSD stand for?\n    - A: Post-Traumatic Stress Disease\n    - B: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\n    - C: Post-Traumatic Stress Dysfunction\n    - D: Post-Traumatic Stress Disability\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) Which of the following is NOT a common symptom of PTSD?\n    - A: Flashbacks\n    - B: Nightmares\n    - C: Insomnia\n    - D: High blood sugar\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined to make the distractor more plausible but incorrect.\n\n3) How does the brain process traumatic events that can lead to PTSD?\n    - A: By ignoring traumatic events\n    - B: By processing traumatic events in a way that can lead to a malfunction of biological mechanisms\n    - C: By only activating the \"fight-flight-freeze\" response\n    - D: By only increasing stress hormones\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible but incorrect.\n\n4) What is the primary function of the autonomic nervous system in relation to PTSD?\n    - A: To regulate cognitive functions\n    - B: To regulate emotional responses\n    - C: To regulate functions like heart rate, digestion, and respiration\n    - D: To regulate motor functions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What can help individuals with PTSD recover?\n    - A: Providing social support, acceptance, and empathy\n    - B: Ignoring their symptoms\n    - C: Focusing on self-care practices only\n    - D: Avoiding triggers only\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) Why is it essential to recognize the symptoms of PTSD?\n    - A: To develop effective treatment plans\n    - B: To provide social support\n    - C: To help individuals seek evaluation and treatment\n    - D: To manage symptoms only\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between the brain's alarm system and the development of PTSD symptoms?\n    - A: The brain's alarm system has no relation to PTSD symptoms\n    - B: The brain's alarm system is only activated in individuals with PTSD\n    - C: The brain's alarm system can contribute to the development of PTSD symptoms\n    - D: The brain's alarm system is only responsible for physiological changes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is a potential consequence of triggers on individuals with PTSD?\n    - A: Increased social interaction\n    - B: Improved emotional regulation\n    - C: Isolation\n    - D: Increased self-awareness\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What can be achieved by understanding the brain's alarm system and the development of PTSD symptoms?\n    - A: Understanding the underlying causes of PTSD\n    - B: Developing effective treatment plans only\n    - C: Providing social support only\n    - D: Managing symptoms only\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What can be developed by integrating psychotherapy, medication, and self-care practices?\n    - A: New treatment approaches\n    - B: Increased awareness and education programs\n    - C: Effective treatment plans\n    - D: Improved emotional regulation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is essential to evaluate when assessing the effectiveness of different treatment approaches for PTSD?\n    - A: The impact of social support only\n    - B: The effectiveness of medication only\n    - C: The combination of psychotherapy, medication, and self-care practices\n    - D: The cost of treatment approaches\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) Why is it necessary to justify the need for increased awareness and education about PTSD?\n    - A: To develop effective treatment plans\n    - B: To provide social support\n    - C: To reduce stigma and promote understanding\n    - D: To manage symptoms only\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nAdditional suggestions:\n\n- Consider adding more questions that focus on the specific symptoms and characteristics of PTSD.\n- Consider adding more questions that focus on the importance of social support and acceptance in helping individuals with PTSD recover.\n- Consider adding more questions that focus on the potential consequences of not seeking treatment for PTSD."
