    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge:**\n1. The alien monolith is located on planet RH-1729.\n2. The probe is composed of 27 cube modules that can self-assemble into a 3x3x3 cube.\n3. The modules can be placed anywhere in the cube and at any orientation.\n4. The probe requires a protective coating for extreme environments: red for deep space, purple for intense heat, and green for electric storms.\n5. Each face of the cube modules can only have a single color coating.\n6. There are 8 corner cubes, 12 edge cubes, 6 face cubes, and a single center cube.\n7. The total number of faces is 162.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n1. The goal is to apply color coatings to the 27 cube modules so that the probe can re-assemble itself to show only red, then purple, then green.\n2. The solution involves painting the outside of the complete cube red, breaking it into 27 pieces, and analyzing the number of faces that need to be painted for each color.\n3. Symmetry is used to help find a solution, as there is no margin for waste.\n\n**Application:**\n1. Real-world applications of this problem could include designing modular systems for space exploration or developing adaptive materials for extreme environments.\n2. This problem could be applied to fields such as engineering, materials science, or astrophysics.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. The relationship between the number of faces painted for each color and the total number of faces is crucial to solving the problem.\n2. The use of symmetry helps to identify a solution that minimizes waste and ensures that the probe can re-assemble itself correctly.\n3. The problem requires analyzing the different types of cubes (corner, edge, face, and center) and their respective properties.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n1. Combining the concepts of modular design, adaptive materials, and symmetry could lead to innovative solutions for space exploration or other fields.\n2. The idea of using a single center cube with half green and half purple faces could be applied to other problems involving modular systems and symmetry.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of the solution requires considering factors such as the number of faces painted, the symmetry of the design, and the ability of the probe to re-assemble itself correctly.\n2. Justifying the use of a particular color coating for each face of the cube modules requires analyzing the environmental conditions that the probe will encounter.\n3. Critiquing the solution could involve considering alternative approaches or materials that could achieve the same goal more efficiently or effectively."
