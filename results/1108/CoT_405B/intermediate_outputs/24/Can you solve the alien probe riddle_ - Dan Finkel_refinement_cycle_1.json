    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) On which planet is the alien monolith located?\n    - A: Planet RH-1728\n    - B: Planet RH-1729\n    - C: Planet RH-1730\n    - D: Planet RH-1731\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the total number of faces on the 3x3x3 cube?\n    - A: 120\n    - B: 150\n    - C: 162\n    - D: 180\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary goal of applying color coatings to the 27 cube modules?\n    - A: To increase the probe's durability\n    - B: To allow the probe to re-assemble itself to show only red, then purple, then green\n    - C: To reduce the probe's weight\n    - D: To enhance the probe's aesthetic appeal\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What concept is used to help find a solution to the problem of applying color coatings to the cube modules?\n    - A: Trial and error\n    - B: Symmetry\n    - C: Random chance\n    - D: Brute force\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Which field is most relevant to the problem of designing a modular system for extreme environments?\n    - A: Biology\n    - B: Engineering\n    - C: Psychology\n    - D: Economics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential real-world application of the problem of designing a modular system for extreme environments?\n    - A: Developing new medical treatments\n    - B: Designing modular systems for space exploration\n    - C: Creating new forms of entertainment\n    - D: Improving agricultural practices\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the number of faces painted for each color and the total number of faces?\n    - A: The number of faces painted for each color is independent of the total number of faces\n    - B: The number of faces painted for each color is directly proportional to the total number of faces\n    - C: The number of faces painted for each color is inversely proportional to the total number of faces\n    - D: The number of faces painted for each color is crucial to solving the problem, and they must add up to the total number of faces\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) Why is it important to analyze the different types of cubes (corner, edge, face, and center) in the problem?\n    - A: To determine the color coatings for each type of cube\n    - B: To identify the properties of each type of cube and their respective roles in the solution\n    - C: To calculate the total number of faces on the cube\n    - D: To determine the optimal arrangement of the cubes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What could be the result of combining the concepts of modular design, adaptive materials, and symmetry?\n    - A: A new form of entertainment\n    - B: A new medical treatment\n    - C: Innovative solutions for space exploration or other fields\n    - D: A new type of food\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How could the idea of using a single center cube with half green and half purple faces be applied?\n    - A: To create a new form of art\n    - B: To develop new medical treatments\n    - C: To other problems involving modular systems and symmetry\n    - D: To improve agricultural practices\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What factors should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of the solution to the problem of designing a modular system for extreme environments?\n    - A: Only the number of faces painted\n    - B: Only the symmetry of the design\n    - C: Only the ability of the probe to re-assemble itself correctly\n    - D: The number of faces painted, the symmetry of the design, and the ability of the probe to re-assemble itself correctly\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is required to justify the use of a particular color coating for each face of the cube modules?\n    - A: A random selection process\n    - B: An analysis of the environmental conditions that the probe will encounter\n    - C: A vote by a committee\n    - D: A trial and error process\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12. However, I suggest considering additional questions to further assess the understanding of the concepts and problem-solving skills."
