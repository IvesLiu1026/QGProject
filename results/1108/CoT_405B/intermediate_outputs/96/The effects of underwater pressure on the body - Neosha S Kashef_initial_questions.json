What should the fisherman do to prevent barotrauma?\n    - A: Release the fish immediately at the surface\n    - B: Use a descending device to lower the fish back to its habitat\n    - C: Keep the fish in a tank on the boat\n    - D: Give the fish oxygen\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A scuba diver is ascending from a dive and needs to avoid decompression sickness. What should the diver do?\n    - A: Ascend rapidly to the surface\n    - B: Take decompression stops at regular intervals\n    - C: Hold their breath\n    - D: Swim horizontally\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, Contrasts, Cause-and-Effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between pressure and gas volume, and how does it affect fish bodies?\n    - A: As pressure increases, gas volume decreases, causing fish bodies to expand.\n    - B: As pressure increases, gas volume decreases, causing fish bodies to compress.\n    - C: As pressure decreases, gas volume increases, causing fish bodies to expand.\n    - D: As pressure decreases, gas volume decreases, causing fish bodies to compress.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the contrast between the effects of barotrauma on fish and decompression sickness on divers?\n    - A: Both conditions are caused by rapid changes in pressure, but barotrauma affects fish and decompression sickness affects divers.\n    - B: Both conditions are caused by slow changes in pressure, but barotrauma affects fish and decompression sickness affects divers.\n    - C: Barotrauma is caused by rapid changes in pressure, while decompression sickness is caused by slow changes in pressure.\n    - D: Barotrauma affects divers, while decompression sickness affects fish.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1) How do Boyle's gas law and Henry's law relate to decompression sickness?\n    - A: Boyle's gas law explains how gas volume changes with pressure, while Henry's law explains how gas dissolves in liquids.\n    - B: Boyle's gas law explains how gas dissolves in liquids, while Henry's law explains how gas volume changes with pressure.\n    - C: Both laws explain how gas volume changes with pressure.\n    - D: Both laws explain how gas dissolves in liquids.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What strategy could be developed by integrating the concepts of barotrauma and recompression?\n    - A: A strategy for sustainable fishing practices that involves releasing fish at the surface\n    - B: A strategy for sustainable fishing practices that involves using descending devices to lower fish back to their habitat\n    - C: A strategy for reducing decompression sickness in divers\n    - D: A strategy for reducing barotrauma in fish\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, Critique, Justification)**\n\n1) What is the most effective method for preventing barotrauma in fish?\n    - A: Releasing fish at the surface\n    - B: Using descending devices to lower fish back to their habitat\n    - C: Keeping fish in tanks on boats\n    - D: Giving fish oxygen\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why is the myth that piercing a fish's stomach with a needle will help it recover from barotrauma incorrect?\n    - A: Because it allows gas to escape from the fish's body\n    - B: Because it allows water to enter the fish's body\n    - C: Because it does not address the root cause of barotrauma\n    - D: Because it is not a scientifically proven method\n[Correct answer]: C"
