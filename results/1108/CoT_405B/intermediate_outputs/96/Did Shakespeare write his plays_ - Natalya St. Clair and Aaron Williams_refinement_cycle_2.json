Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who formalized the method of stylometry in the late 1800s?\n    - A: William Shakespeare\n    - B: Wincenty Lutos≈Çawski\n    - C: Francis Bacon\n    - D: Christopher Marlowe\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What involves analyzing syntax, grammar, semantics, and vocabulary to investigate literary authorship?\n    - A: Principal Component Analysis\n    - B: Stylometry\n    - C: Literary Criticism\n    - D: Linguistics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined option D to Linguistics, which is a more plausible distractor.\n\n3) What is the primary concept behind stylometry in investigating literary authorship?\n    - A: Analyzing the historical context of a work\n    - B: Examining the unique characteristics of a writer's style\n    - C: Comparing the works of different authors\n    - D: Evaluating the emotional impact of a work\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) How is Principal Component Analysis (PCA) used in stylometry?\n    - A: To increase the multidimensional space of a dataset\n    - B: To reduce the multidimensional space and measure variance in a dataset\n    - C: To identify the author of a disputed work\n    - D: To detect plagiarism in academic settings\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) A professor suspects that a student has plagiarized an essay. Which method could the professor use to detect plagiarism?\n    - A: Historical Analysis\n    - B: Literary Criticism\n    - C: Stylometry\n    - D: Machine Learning Algorithm\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) A historian wants to determine the authenticity of an ancient text. Which method could the historian use?\n    - A: Stylometry\n    - B: Principal Component Analysis\n    - C: Literary Criticism\n    - D: Archaeological Analysis\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between stylometry and literary authorship?\n    - A: Stylometry is used to evaluate the emotional impact of a work\n    - B: Stylometry is used to analyze the historical context of a work\n    - C: Stylometry is used to investigate the unique characteristics of a writer's style\n    - D: Stylometry is used to compare the works of different authors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the connection between a writer's style and their unique characteristics?\n    - A: A writer's style is influenced by their historical context\n    - B: A writer's style is shaped by their unique characteristics\n    - C: A writer's style is determined by their emotional state\n    - D: A writer's style is independent of their unique characteristics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) How could stylometry be combined with other methods of literary analysis to gain a deeper understanding of an author's style?\n    - A: By using stylometry to analyze the historical context of a work\n    - B: By integrating stylometry with machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy\n    - C: By applying stylometry to non-literary texts\n    - D: By combining stylometry with literary criticism to analyze the author's use of language\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined option D to make it more specific and accurate.\n\n10) What could be the potential outcome of using stylometry to analyze the evolution of an author's style over time?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the author's historical context\n    - B: A greater appreciation for the author's emotional state\n    - C: A more nuanced understanding of the author's unique characteristics\n    - D: A more accurate detection of plagiarism\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is a potential limitation of stylometry in capturing the beauty and emotional impact of literary works?\n    - A: Stylometry is too focused on the historical context of a work\n    - B: Stylometry is too narrow in its analysis of a writer's style\n    - C: Stylometry neglects the emotional impact of a work\n    - D: Stylometry is too broad in its application\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) How could the results of stylometric analysis be compared with other methods of literary analysis?\n    - A: By evaluating the accuracy of stylometry in detecting plagiarism\n    - B: By critiquing the limitations of stylometry in capturing the beauty of a work\n    - C: By justifying the use of stylometry in academic settings\n    - D: By comparing the results of stylometry with those of literary criticism and historical analysis\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined option D to make it more specific and accurate."
