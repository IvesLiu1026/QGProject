    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What does the law of conservation of mass state about the total mass of an isolated system?\n    - A: It can be created or destroyed within the system.\n    - B: It can be transferred across the system's boundary.\n    - C: It remains constant, with no net creation or destruction.\n    - D: It only applies to certain chemical reactions.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What happens to the energy applied to the reactants in a chemical reaction, according to the law of conservation of mass?\n    - A: It is lost as heat.\n    - B: It is stored in the bonds between atoms.\n    - C: It is converted into new matter.\n    - D: It is released as light, but not stored.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) According to the transcript, what is the origin of the atoms that make up our universe?\n    - A: They were formed through geological processes on Earth.\n    - B: They were formed in the Big Bang and subsequent nuclear reactions in stars.\n    - C: They were brought to Earth by comets and meteorites.\n    - D: They are eternal and have always existed.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the relationship between mass and energy, as described by Einstein's equation?\n    - A: Mass and energy are unrelated.\n    - B: Mass is converted into energy, but not vice versa.\n    - C: Energy is equivalent to mass.\n    - D: Mass is only related to energy in certain chemical reactions.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) In a nuclear reaction that releases energy, what happens to the total mass of the starting atoms?\n    - A: The mass increases due to the energy released.\n    - B: The mass remains the same, as energy is not related to mass.\n    - C: The mass decreases, corresponding to the gain in energy.\n    - D: The mass is converted into a different element.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo significant changes were made to the initial questions, as they align with the key concepts in the transcript and are clear and concise. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. \n\nNo more refinement needed."
