The correct answer is subjective and may vary depending on individual perspectives.)\n\n2) Does the use of evolutionary algorithms in artistic applications diminish the value of human creativity?\n    - A: Yes, because machines can generate art more efficiently\n    - B: Yes, because machines can generate art more creatively\n    - C: No, because human creativity and machine creativity are different and valuable in their own ways\n    - D: No, because machines can only generate art based on human input\n[Correct answer]: C (Note: This question requires the test-taker to evaluate the impact of machine creativity on human creativity and make a judgment call. The correct answer is subjective and may vary depending on individual perspectives.)"
