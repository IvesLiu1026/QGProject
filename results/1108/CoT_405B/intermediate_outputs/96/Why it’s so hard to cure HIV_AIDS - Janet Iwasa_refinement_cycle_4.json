    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary method through which HIV spreads?\n    - A: Casual contact with an infected person\n    - B: Sharing contaminated food or water\n    - C: Exchanges of bodily fluids, such as through unprotected sex or contaminated needles\n    - D: Airborne transmission\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which cells in the immune system are primarily targeted by HIV?\n    - A: Cytotoxic T cells\n    - B: Helper T cells\n    - C: B cells\n    - D: Macrophages\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the name of the stage of HIV infection where patients are in serious danger of contracting deadly infections due to a weakened immune system?\n    - A: Acute HIV infection\n    - B: Chronic HIV infection\n    - C: Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)\n    - D: Retroviral infection\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the primary function of the most commonly prescribed antiretroviral therapy drugs?\n    - A: To destroy infected T cells\n    - B: To prevent the viral genome from being copied and incorporated into a host cell's DNA\n    - C: To activate dormant HIV viruses\n    - D: To boost the immune system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Why is it challenging to completely cure HIV with current treatments?\n    - A: HIV is highly contagious\n    - B: HIV is a rapidly mutating virus\n    - C: HIV can hide out in the DNA of healthy T cells, making it difficult to eradicate\n    - D: HIV only infects helper T cells\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) According to the transcript, what is one research approach being explored to develop a true cure for HIV?\n    - A: Using a vaccine to prevent HIV infection\n    - B: Using a drug to activate all cells harboring the HIV genetic information\n    - C: Using genetic tools to introduce HIV DNA into cells\n    - D: Using antiretroviral therapy to manage HIV levels\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is a major challenge in providing effective HIV treatment and prevention worldwide?\n    - A: Limited access to antiretroviral therapy in certain regions, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa\n    - B: High cost of antiretroviral therapy\n    - C: Stigma associated with HIV infection\n    - D: Lack of funding for research\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined question 8) (Added to the set)\n8) What is a potential outcome of using a drug to activate all cells harboring the HIV genetic information?\n    - A: The virus will become more contagious\n    - B: The virus will become more resistant to treatment\n    - C: The virus will be flushed out into the open, making it vulnerable to current treatments\n    - D: The virus will be eradicated immediately\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-7. The added question 8 is designed to test the understanding of the research approach mentioned in the transcript."
