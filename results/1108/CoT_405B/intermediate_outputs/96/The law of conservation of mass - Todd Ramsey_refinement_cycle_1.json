    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript and initial feedback, I have refined the questions to better align with the key concepts, enhance clarity and conciseness, and ensure distractors are plausible but incorrect.\n\nSince there were no initial questions provided, I will create new questions based on the transcript.\n\n1) What does the law of conservation of mass state about an isolated system?\n    - A: Mass can be created or destroyed within the system.\n    - B: Mass can be transferred across the system's boundary.\n    - C: Mass can neither be created nor destroyed within the system.\n    - D: Mass is only conserved in certain chemical reactions.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) In a chemical reaction, what happens to the energy applied to the reactants?\n    - A: It is lost as heat.\n    - B: It is stored in the bonds between atoms.\n    - C: It is converted into matter.\n    - D: It is released as light only.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) According to the transcript, what is the origin of the atoms that make up our universe?\n    - A: They were created in a laboratory.\n    - B: They were formed in the Big Bang and subsequent nuclear reactions in stars.\n    - C: They were brought to Earth by comets.\n    - D: They are eternal and have always existed.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the relationship between mass and energy, as described by Einstein's equation?\n    - A: Mass and energy are unrelated.\n    - B: Mass is converted into energy, but not vice versa.\n    - C: Energy is equivalent to mass.\n    - D: Mass is only related to energy in certain chemical reactions.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What happens to the mass of the starting atoms in a nuclear reaction that releases energy?\n    - A: The mass increases.\n    - B: The mass remains the same.\n    - C: The mass decreases, corresponding to the gain in energy.\n    - D: The mass is converted into a different element.\n[Correct answer]: C"
