    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary function of the respiratory system?\n    - A: To regulate the body's temperature\n    - B: To transport nutrients to the body's cells\n    - C: To transport oxygen to the body's cells and remove carbon dioxide\n    - D: To remove waste products from the digestive system\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What protein in red blood cells is responsible for carrying oxygen?\n    - A: Myoglobin\n    - B: Oxygenase\n    - C: Carbonic anhydrase\n    - D: Hemoglobin\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) How does the respiratory system function in relation to conscious thought?\n    - A: It functions partially with conscious thought\n    - B: It functions automatically, without conscious thought\n    - C: It functions only with conscious thought\n    - D: It functions in conjunction with the somatic nervous system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Where does gas exchange occur in the respiratory system?\n    - A: In the trachea\n    - B: In the bronchioles\n    - C: In the alveoli\n    - D: In the lungs' parenchyma tissue\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What process allows oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules to move across the alveolar-capillary membrane?\n    - A: Osmosis\n    - B: Diffusion\n    - C: Active transport\n    - D: Filtration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is crucial for maintaining automatic breathing in the respiratory system?\n    - A: The relationship between the autonomic nervous system and the circulatory system\n    - B: The relationship between the autonomic nervous system and the digestive system\n    - C: The relationship between the somatic nervous system and the respiratory system\n    - D: The relationship between the autonomic nervous system and the respiratory system\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What are the small air sacs where gas exchange occurs in the lungs called?\n    - A: Bronchioles\n    - B: Trachea\n    - C: Parenchyma tissue\n    - D: Alveoli\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) Approximately how many liters of air do the lungs inhale and exhale each day?\n    - A: 1,000 liters\n    - B: 5,000 liters\n    - C: 10,000 liters\n    - D: 20,000 liters\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
