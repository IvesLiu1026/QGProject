What type of therapy can manage levels of HIV and prevent T cell counts from getting low enough for the disease to progress to AIDS?\n    - A: Antiviral therapy\n    - B: Antiretroviral therapy\n    - C: Antibacterial therapy\n    - D: Antifungal therapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension**\n1. What is the primary mechanism by which antiretroviral therapy works to manage HIV infection?\n    - A: By boosting the immune system\n    - B: By preventing the viral genome from being copied and incorporated into a host cell's DNA\n    - C: By destroying infected cells\n    - D: By reducing inflammation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. Why is it challenging to completely eliminate the HIV virus from the body?\n    - A: Because HIV can only infect certain cells\n    - B: Because HIV can hide out in the DNA of healthy T cells\n    - C: Because HIV can only be transmitted through casual contact\n    - D: Because HIV can only be treated with antiretroviral therapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n1. What is a potential strategy for preventing the spread of HIV?\n    - A: Promoting unprotected sex practices\n    - B: Providing access to clean needles and promoting safe sex practices\n    - C: Reducing access to antiretroviral therapy\n    - D: Increasing the cost of HIV testing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. How can antiretroviral therapy be used to manage HIV infection?\n    - A: By administering it only when symptoms appear\n    - B: By administering it only to patients with advanced HIV infection\n    - C: By administering it consistently to manage HIV levels and prevent the progression to AIDS\n    - D: By administering it only to patients with other health conditions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis**\n1. What is the relationship between HIV and the immune system?\n    - A: HIV strengthens the immune system\n    - B: HIV has no impact on the immune system\n    - C: HIV targets and destroys helper T cells\n    - D: HIV only infects cells that are not part of the immune system\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What is the cause-and-effect connection between the lack of access to antiretroviral therapy and the high number of HIV-related deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa?\n    - A: The lack of access to antiretroviral therapy has no impact on HIV-related deaths\n    - B: The lack of access to antiretroviral therapy is a direct cause of the high number of HIV-related deaths\n    - C: The lack of access to antiretroviral therapy is only an indirect cause of the high number of HIV-related deaths\n    - D: The lack of access to antiretroviral therapy is not a significant factor in HIV-related deaths\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n1. What is a potential approach to developing a cure for HIV?\n    - A: Combining antiretroviral therapy with other treatments, such as a drug to activate all cells harboring the HIV genetic information\n    - B: Using antiretroviral therapy alone to manage HIV infection\n    - C: Reducing access to antiretroviral therapy to encourage the development of new treatments\n    - D: Focusing solely on developing a vaccine to prevent new infections\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2. How can integrating HIV prevention and treatment into existing healthcare systems help address the cultural, economic, and political barriers to effective prevention and treatment?\n    - A: By increasing the cost of HIV testing and treatment\n    - B: By reducing access to antiretroviral therapy\n    - C: By increasing access to antiretroviral therapy and promoting education and awareness about HIV\n    - D: By only providing HIV testing and treatment to certain populations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation**\n1. What is a key factor to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in managing HIV infection?\n    - A: The cost of the therapy\n    - B: The availability of the therapy\n    - C: The evidence presented on the therapy's ability to manage HIV levels and prevent the progression to AIDS\n    - D: The potential side effects of the therapy\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What is a key challenge to consider when critiquing the need for ongoing treatment for HIV-positive patients?\n    - A: The high cost of antiretroviral therapy\n    - B: The potential side effects of antiretroviral therapy\n    - C: The impact of ongoing treatment on patients' quality of life and the healthcare system\n    - D: The lack of access to antiretroviral therapy\n[Correct answer]: C"
