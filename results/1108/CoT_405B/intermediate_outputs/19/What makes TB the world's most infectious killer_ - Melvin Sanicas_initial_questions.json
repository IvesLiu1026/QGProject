    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level based on the provided content analysis:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is the name of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB)?\n    - A: Mycobacterium pneumoniae\n    - B: Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n    - C: Streptococcus pneumoniae\n    - D: Haemophilus influenzae\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) In what year was the BCG vaccine developed to battle TB?\n    - A: 1882\n    - B: 1895\n    - C: 1921\n    - D: 2008\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) How is tuberculosis (TB) typically spread?\n    - A: Through contaminated food and water\n    - B: Through direct contact with an infected person\n    - C: Through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes\n    - D: Through insect vectors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the typical response of the immune system to TB infection?\n    - A: The immune system ignores the bacteria, allowing them to multiply freely\n    - B: The immune system sends macrophages to absorb and break down the bacteria\n    - C: The immune system produces antibodies to neutralize the bacteria\n    - D: The immune system triggers an allergic reaction to eliminate the bacteria\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) A healthcare worker is caring for a patient with active TB in a crowded hospital ward. What is the most effective way to prevent the spread of TB to other patients and healthcare workers?\n    - A: Providing the patient with a surgical mask to wear at all times\n    - B: Isolating the patient in a negative-pressure room\n    - C: Administering antibiotics to all patients and healthcare workers on the ward\n    - D: Restricting visitation to the patient\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A community health worker is tasked with reducing the incidence of TB in a poverty-stricken neighborhood. What is the most effective strategy to achieve this goal?\n    - A: Providing free TB testing and treatment to all residents\n    - B: Conducting educational campaigns to raise awareness about TB prevention and treatment\n    - C: Improving access to nutritious food and clean water\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect connections)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between poverty and the spread of TB?\n    - A: Poverty has no impact on the spread of TB\n    - B: Poverty increases the risk of developing TB, but does not affect its spread\n    - C: Poverty contributes to the spread of TB by increasing crowding and poor living conditions\n    - D: Poverty reduces the risk of developing TB\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the main difference between latent and active TB?\n    - A: Latent TB is more contagious than active TB\n    - B: Latent TB has no symptoms, while active TB has noticeable symptoms\n    - C: Latent TB is more easily treatable than active TB\n    - D: Latent TB is a different strain of the bacteria than active TB\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas to form new understanding)**\n\n1) A healthcare system is considering implementing a comprehensive TB control program that includes vaccination, screening, and treatment. What is the potential benefit of this approach?\n    - A: Reduced costs associated with TB treatment\n    - B: Improved patient outcomes and reduced transmission of TB\n    - C: Increased access to healthcare services for marginalized populations\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) A researcher is exploring the potential benefits of using mobile health apps to improve TB diagnosis and treatment. What is a potential advantage of this approach?\n    - A: Increased access to healthcare services for rural populations\n    - B: Improved patient adherence to treatment regimens\n    - C: Enhanced data collection and analysis for TB surveillance\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) A healthcare provider is considering using a new oral treatment for TB that has shown promise in clinical trials. What is a potential limitation of this approach?\n    - A: The treatment may not be effective against all strains of TB\n    - B: The treatment may have significant side effects or interactions with other medications\n    - C: The treatment may be more expensive than existing options\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) A public health official is tasked with allocating resources for TB treatment and prevention in a resource-constrained setting. What is a potential ethical consideration in this decision?\n    - A: The official should prioritize treatment for those who are most likely to benefit\n    - B: The official should prioritize prevention efforts to reduce the incidence of TB\n    - C: The official should prioritize treatment for those who are most vulnerable or marginalized\n    - D: The official should prioritize cost-effectiveness in allocating resources\n[Correct answer]: C"
