Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many people worldwide rely on seafood as a significant source of protein and nutrition?\n    - A: 1 billion\n    - B: 2 billion\n    - C: 3 billion\n    - D: 4 billion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) According to recent studies, what percentage of wild fisheries are overfished?\n    - A: 20%\n    - B: 25%\n    - C: 30%\n    - D: 33%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is a common issue associated with net pens in aquaculture?\n    - A: Low production costs\n    - B: High-quality seafood\n    - C: Pollution, disease, and escapes\n    - D: Limited scalability\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is a significant hurdle in sustainable aquaculture, particularly for inland fish farms?\n    - A: Water quality\n    - B: Fishmeal\n    - C: Energy consumption\n    - D: Labor costs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can regenerative ocean farming benefit coastal communities?\n    - A: By reducing the number of jobs available\n    - B: By creating jobs and supporting local economies\n    - C: By increasing pollution and habitat destruction\n    - D: By promoting unsustainable fishing practices\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can contained systems, such as tanks and raceways, be used for in aquaculture?\n    - A: To increase the use of fishmeal\n    - B: To promote traditional fishing practices\n    - C: To farm fish and other seafood in a more sustainable manner\n    - D: To reduce the production of seafood\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is a cause-and-effect connection in the context of aquaculture?\n    - A: The use of fishmeal and the reduction of pollution\n    - B: The use of fishmeal and the increase of sustainable practices\n    - C: The use of fishmeal and overfishing\n    - D: The use of fishmeal and the decrease of seafood production\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a contrast in the context of aquaculture?\n    - A: Traditional aquaculture methods vs. sustainable agriculture practices\n    - B: Traditional aquaculture methods vs. regenerative ocean farming\n    - C: Contained systems vs. industrial agriculture\n    - D: Fishmeal vs. plant-based proteins\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be integrated with regenerative ocean farming to create a more environmentally friendly food system?\n    - A: Sustainable distribution networks\n    - B: Traditional aquaculture methods\n    - C: Contained systems\n    - D: Fishmeal\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can be combined with contained systems to reduce the environmental impact of aquaculture?\n    - A: Innovative feed sources (e.g., insects, plant-based proteins)\n    - B: Traditional aquaculture methods\n    - C: Regenerative ocean farming\n    - D: Fishmeal\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a justification for the need for regenerative ocean farming?\n    - A: It increases pollution and habitat destruction\n    - B: It promotes unsustainable fishing practices\n    - C: It has potential benefits for the environment, human health, and local economies\n    - D: It reduces the production of seafood\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of different aquaculture methods?\n    - A: Environmental impact and sustainability\n    - B: Production costs and scalability\n    - C: Water quality and energy consumption\n    - D: Labor costs and job creation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
