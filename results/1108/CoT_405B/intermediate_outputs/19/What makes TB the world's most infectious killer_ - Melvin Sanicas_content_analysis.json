    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. Two 9,000-year-old skeletons were discovered in 2008 with bones infected by the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB).\n2. TB has been known by different names throughout history, including phthisis (ancient Greeks), chaky oncay (Incas), and tuberculosis (English).\n3. TB is one of the world's biggest infectious killers, causing more deaths than malaria or HIV and AIDS.\n4. The bacteria that cause TB are called Mycobacterium tuberculosis and are typically airborne.\n5. The BCG vaccine was developed in 1921 to battle TB.\n6. Robert Koch identified the bacterial origins of TB in 1882.\n7. Wilhelm Roentgen discovered the X-ray in 1895, enabling physicians to diagnose and track TB progression.\n8. TB can spread to the skeletal system, kidneys, intestines, and brain if left untreated.\n9. The classic symptoms of TB include weight loss, a hacking, bloody cough, and ashen skin.\n10. TB was considered a \"romantic disease\" in Victorian-era England, affecting poverty-stricken artists and poets.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. TB is a bacterial infection that can be spread through the air and infects the lungs.\n2. The immune system responds to TB by sending macrophages to absorb and break down the bacteria, but in individuals with weakened immune systems, the bacteria can reproduce and form colonies.\n3. TB can cause a range of symptoms, including chest pain, coughing up blood, and oxygen deprivation.\n4. The disease can spread to other parts of the body, including the skeletal system, kidneys, intestines, and brain.\n5. TB has been a major public health concern throughout history, with various cultures and societies having different understandings and approaches to the disease.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. How can TB be prevented and controlled in crowded urban areas or in communities with limited access to healthcare?\n2. What are the implications of TB for individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV or AIDS?\n3. How can healthcare providers and policymakers work together to develop and implement effective TB treatment and prevention strategies?\n4. What role can education and awareness play in reducing the stigma associated with TB and encouraging people to seek treatment?\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect connections)**\n\n1. The relationship between TB and poverty: how does poverty contribute to the spread of TB, and how can addressing poverty help to reduce TB incidence?\n2. The contrast between latent and active TB: how do the symptoms and treatment options differ between these two forms of the disease?\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between TB and malnutrition: how does malnutrition increase the risk of developing TB, and how can addressing malnutrition help to prevent TB?\n4. The impact of TB on different populations: how does TB affect different age groups, ethnicities, and socioeconomic classes, and what are the implications for public health policy?\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas to form new understanding)**\n\n1. How can the development of new diagnostics, such as the urine test, and new treatments, such as the oral treatment, be combined to improve TB control and prevention?\n2. What are the potential benefits and challenges of implementing a comprehensive TB control program that incorporates vaccination, screening, and treatment?\n3. How can the social and economic determinants of TB be addressed through a combination of policy changes, education, and community engagement?\n4. What role can technology, such as mobile health apps and telemedicine, play in improving TB diagnosis, treatment, and prevention?\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. What are the strengths and limitations of current TB treatment options, and how can they be improved?\n2. How effective are current TB prevention strategies, and what are the potential benefits and drawbacks of new approaches, such as vaccination?\n3. What are the ethical implications of prioritizing TB treatment and prevention in resource-constrained settings, and how can these decisions be justified?\n4. How can the stigma associated with TB be addressed and reduced, and what are the potential benefits of increased awareness and education about the disease?"
