    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level based on the provided content analysis:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is the primary function of the thread-like hyphae in mycorrhizal fungi?\n    - A: To produce sugars through photosynthesis\n    - B: To form the mycelium, connecting tree roots\n    - C: To collect nutrients from the soil and pass them to tree roots\n    - D: To communicate with other trees through fungal networks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the estimated number of species of mycorrhizal fungi?\n    - A: 10-20 species\n    - B: 50-70 species\n    - C: 100 species\n    - D: 1000 species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What is the primary benefit of the symbiotic relationship between trees and fungi?\n    - A: Trees provide nutrients to fungi, while fungi provide sugars to trees\n    - B: Trees and fungi compete for resources, leading to a more resilient ecosystem\n    - C: Trees provide sugars to fungi, while fungi provide nutrients to trees\n    - D: Trees and fungi have no direct interaction or benefit\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the role of older trees in the forest ecosystem?\n    - A: They compete with younger trees for resources\n    - B: They provide shade, reducing photosynthesis in younger trees\n    - C: They play a crucial role in supporting younger trees through the mycorrhizal network\n    - D: They have no impact on the growth of younger trees\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) How can understanding the mycorrhizal network inform strategies for sustainable forest management?\n    - A: By promoting the clear-cutting of old-growth forests\n    - B: By prioritizing the preservation of individual tree species\n    - C: By adopting a holistic approach that considers the interconnectedness of trees and fungi\n    - D: By ignoring the role of fungi in the forest ecosystem\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a potential application of the concept of symbiotic relationships between trees and fungi in other ecosystems?\n    - A: Promoting competition between species in coral reefs\n    - B: Encouraging cooperation between species in grasslands\n    - C: Reducing biodiversity in ecosystems\n    - D: Ignoring the role of symbiotic relationships in ecosystem management\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and contrasts)**\n\n1) What is the primary characteristic of the relationship between trees and fungi in the mycorrhizal network?\n    - A: Mutual competition for resources\n    - B: Mutual benefit and cooperation\n    - C: One-sided benefit, with trees providing all resources to fungi\n    - D: One-sided benefit, with fungi providing all resources to trees\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a key contrast between individual trees and the forest ecosystem as a whole?\n    - A: Individual trees are interconnected, while the forest ecosystem is self-sufficient\n    - B: Individual trees are self-sufficient, while the forest ecosystem is interconnected\n    - C: Individual trees are competitive, while the forest ecosystem is cooperative\n    - D: Individual trees are cooperative, while the forest ecosystem is competitive\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How can the concept of mycorrhizal networks be combined with other ecological principles to inform conservation strategies?\n    - A: By prioritizing the preservation of individual tree species\n    - B: By adopting a holistic approach that considers biodiversity, ecosystem services, and symbiotic relationships\n    - C: By promoting competition between species in ecosystems\n    - D: By ignoring the role of fungi in ecosystem management\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a potential application of the concept of symbiotic relationships between trees and fungi in other fields?\n    - A: Developing new approaches to sustainable resource management in agriculture\n    - B: Promoting competition between companies in business\n    - C: Reducing biodiversity in ecosystems\n    - D: Ignoring the role of symbiotic relationships in ecosystem management\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n1) Why is it important to preserve old-growth forests and the mycorrhizal networks they support?\n    - A: Because they provide a source of timber and other natural resources\n    - B: Because they promote competition between tree species\n    - C: Because they provide ecosystem services and support biodiversity conservation\n    - D: Because they have no impact on the environment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a potential critique of traditional views of ecology and conservation based on the study of mycorrhizal networks?\n    - A: That they prioritize cooperation and interconnectedness in natural systems\n    - B: That they ignore the role of fungi in ecosystem management\n    - C: That they prioritize competition between species in ecosystems\n    - D: That they overlook the importance of symbiotic relationships in ecosystem management\n[Correct answer]: D"
