    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge:**\n\n1. In 2017, 40 attendees at a Maryland country fair were diagnosed with swine flu after coming into contact with infected pigs.\n2. Viruses are organic parasites that infect nearly all forms of life.\n3. Viruses must move through three stages to survive and reproduce: contact with a susceptible host, infection and replication, and transmission to other individuals.\n4. Human flu viruses have specific interactions with their host species, including proteins adapted to bind with matching receptors on human respiratory cells.\n5. Viruses can rapidly develop random mutations, which can enable them to better infect a new species.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. Cross-species infections, or viral host jumps, have the potential to produce deadly epidemics.\n2. Viruses have evolved specific interactions with their host species, which allows them to infect and replicate within those hosts.\n3. The genetic dissimilarity between two hosts can make it difficult for a virus to infect a new species.\n4. Viruses that are adapted to infect one species may be able to infect a closely related species with only a few mutations.\n5. Host jumps can be successful if a virus is able to infect a new host's cells and evade an immune response.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. Understanding how viruses infect and replicate within hosts can inform the development of vaccines and containment protocols.\n2. Studying the biology of viruses can help researchers identify potential epidemics and develop strategies to prevent them.\n3. Monitoring populations for new outbreaks can help researchers quickly identify and respond to emerging epidemics.\n4. Developing vaccines and containment protocols can help stop the spread of deadly diseases.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The relationship between the genetic similarity of two hosts and the ability of a virus to infect a new species.\n2. The contrast between viruses that are able to infect a new host's cells but are unable to evade an immune response, and those that are able to evade an immune response but have difficulty transmitting to new hosts.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the rapid reproduction of viruses and the development of random mutations that can enable them to better infect a new species.\n4. The relationship between the number of hosts a virus is able to infect and the potential for a full-blown epidemic.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. Combining the understanding of how viruses infect and replicate within hosts with the knowledge of how viruses can rapidly develop random mutations to inform the development of vaccines and containment protocols.\n2. Integrating the study of the biology of viruses with the monitoring of populations for new outbreaks to quickly identify and respond to emerging epidemics.\n3. Considering the genetic similarity of two hosts and the ability of a virus to infect a new species to predict the potential for a host jump.\n4. Combining the understanding of the relationship between the number of hosts a virus is able to infect and the potential for a full-blown epidemic with the knowledge of how viruses can rapidly develop random mutations to inform the development of strategies to prevent epidemics.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines and containment protocols in preventing the spread of deadly diseases.\n2. Assessing the potential risks and benefits of studying the biology of viruses and monitoring populations for new outbreaks.\n3. Justifying the need for continued research into the biology of viruses and the development of strategies to prevent epidemics.\n4. Critiquing the current methods for predicting the potential for a host jump and identifying areas for improvement."
