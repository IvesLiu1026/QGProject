    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge:**\n1) In 2017, how many attendees at a Maryland country fair were diagnosed with swine flu after coming into contact with infected pigs?\n    - A: 10\n    - B: 20\n    - C: 30\n    - D: 40\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What are the three stages that viruses must move through to survive and reproduce?\n    - A: Contact, replication, and mutation\n    - B: Infection, transmission, and adaptation\n    - C: Contact with a susceptible host, infection and replication, and transmission to other individuals\n    - D: Replication, transmission, and host jump\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension:**\n1) What is the result of cross-species infections, or viral host jumps?\n    - A: The production of new vaccines\n    - B: The development of new treatments\n    - C: The potential to produce deadly epidemics\n    - D: The creation of new viruses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is it difficult for a virus to infect a new species?\n    - A: Because viruses are highly adaptable\n    - B: Because viruses can rapidly develop random mutations\n    - C: Because of the genetic dissimilarity between two hosts\n    - D: Because viruses are highly contagious\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application:**\n1) What is one way that understanding how viruses infect and replicate within hosts can inform public health strategies?\n    - A: By identifying potential epidemics\n    - B: By developing new treatments\n    - C: By informing the development of vaccines and containment protocols\n    - D: By monitoring populations for new outbreaks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is one way that studying the biology of viruses can help researchers?\n    - A: By identifying new viruses\n    - B: By developing new vaccines\n    - C: By identifying potential epidemics and developing strategies to prevent them\n    - D: By monitoring populations for new outbreaks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis:**\n1) What is the relationship between the genetic similarity of two hosts and the ability of a virus to infect a new species?\n    - A: The more genetically similar the hosts, the less likely the virus is to infect the new species\n    - B: The more genetically similar the hosts, the more likely the virus is to infect the new species\n    - C: The genetic similarity of the hosts has no effect on the ability of the virus to infect the new species\n    - D: The less genetically similar the hosts, the more likely the virus is to infect the new species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the rapid reproduction of viruses and the development of random mutations?\n    - A: The rapid reproduction of viruses leads to a decrease in random mutations\n    - B: The rapid reproduction of viruses has no effect on the development of random mutations\n    - C: The rapid reproduction of viruses leads to an increase in random mutations that can enable them to better infect a new species\n    - D: The rapid reproduction of viruses leads to a decrease in the ability of the virus to infect a new species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis:**\n1) How can combining the understanding of how viruses infect and replicate within hosts with the knowledge of how viruses can rapidly develop random mutations inform public health strategies?\n    - A: By identifying potential epidemics\n    - B: By developing new treatments\n    - C: By informing the development of vaccines and containment protocols\n    - D: By monitoring populations for new outbreaks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is one way that integrating the study of the biology of viruses with the monitoring of populations for new outbreaks can help researchers?\n    - A: By identifying new viruses\n    - B: By developing new vaccines\n    - C: By quickly identifying and responding to emerging epidemics\n    - D: By monitoring populations for new outbreaks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation:**\n1) What is one way to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines and containment protocols in preventing the spread of deadly diseases?\n    - A: By monitoring populations for new outbreaks\n    - B: By studying the biology of viruses\n    - C: By tracking the number of cases and deaths from the disease\n    - D: By developing new treatments\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is one way to justify the need for continued research into the biology of viruses and the development of strategies to prevent epidemics?\n    - A: By citing the high cost of research\n    - B: By citing the potential risks of research\n    - C: By citing the potential benefits of research, such as saving lives and preventing economic losses\n    - D: By citing the lack of progress in research\n[Correct answer]: C"
