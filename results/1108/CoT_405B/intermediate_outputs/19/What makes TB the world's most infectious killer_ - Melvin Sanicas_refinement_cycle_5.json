    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the name of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB)?\n    - A: Mycobacterium pneumoniae\n    - B: Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n    - C: Streptococcus pneumoniae\n    - D: Haemophilus influenzae\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) In what year was the BCG vaccine developed to battle TB?\n    - A: 1882\n    - B: 1895\n    - C: 1921\n    - D: 2008\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) How is tuberculosis (TB) typically spread?\n    - A: Through contaminated food and water\n    - B: Through direct contact with an infected person\n    - C: Through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes\n    - D: Through insect vectors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the typical response of the immune system to TB infection?\n    - A: The immune system ignores the bacteria, allowing them to multiply freely\n    - B: The immune system sends macrophages to absorb and break down the bacteria\n    - C: The immune system produces antibodies to neutralize the bacteria\n    - D: The immune system triggers an allergic reaction to eliminate the bacteria\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A healthcare worker is caring for a patient with active TB in a crowded hospital ward. What is the most effective way to prevent the spread of TB to other patients and healthcare workers?\n    - A: Providing the patient with a surgical mask to wear at all times\n    - B: Isolating the patient in a negative-pressure room\n    - C: Administering antibiotics to all patients and healthcare workers on the ward\n    - D: Restricting visitation to the patient\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the most effective strategy to reduce the incidence of TB in a poverty-stricken neighborhood?\n    - A: Providing free TB testing and treatment to all residents\n    - B: Conducting educational campaigns to raise awareness about TB prevention and treatment\n    - C: Improving access to nutritious food and clean water\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) How does poverty contribute to the spread of TB?\n    - A: Poverty has no impact on the spread of TB\n    - B: Poverty increases the risk of developing TB, but does not affect its spread\n    - C: Poverty weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to TB\n    - D: Poverty contributes to the spread of TB by increasing crowding and poor living conditions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the main difference between latent and active TB?\n    - A: Latent TB is more contagious than active TB\n    - B: Latent TB has no symptoms, while active TB has noticeable symptoms\n    - C: Latent TB is more easily treatable than active TB\n    - D: Latent TB is a different strain of the bacteria than active TB\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What percentage of people infected with TB do not show any symptoms?\n    - A: 50%\n    - B: 70%\n    - C: 80%\n    - D: 90%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) Who identified the bacterial origins of TB in 1882?\n    - A: Robert Koch\n    - B: Wilhelm Roentgen\n    - C: Louis Pasteur\n    - D: Alexander Fleming\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) Who discovered the X-ray in 1895, enabling physicians to diagnose and track TB progression?\n    - A: Wilhelm Roentgen\n    - B: Robert Koch\n    - C: Louis Pasteur\n    - D: Alexander Fleming\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is a major diagnostic complication of TB?\n    - A: The disease is highly contagious\n    - B: The disease has a long incubation period\n    - C: The disease often has non-specific symptoms\n    - D: About 90% of people infected with TB do not show any symptoms\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n13) What is a key challenge in treating TB?\n    - A: The treatment is expensive\n    - B: The treatment has significant side effects\n    - C: The treatment requires multiple drugs and a long treatment duration\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n14) What is a potential benefit of a comprehensive TB control program that includes vaccination, screening, and treatment?\n    - A: Reduced costs associated with TB treatment\n    - B: Improved patient outcomes and reduced transmission of TB\n    - C: Increased access to healthcare services for marginalized populations\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n15) What is a potential advantage of using new diagnostic tests and treatments, such as a urine test and oral treatment, in the fight against TB?\n    - A: Increased access to healthcare services for rural populations\n    - B: Improved patient adherence to treatment regimens\n    - C: Faster diagnosis and treatment of TB\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made some minor changes to questions 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 to improve clarity and conciseness. I also changed question 15 to better align with the transcript and to make it more specific to the new diagnostic tests and treatments mentioned.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
