    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In 2017, how many attendees at a Maryland country fair were diagnosed with swine flu after coming into contact with infected pigs?\n    - A: 20\n    - B: 30\n    - C: 35\n    - D: 40\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What are the three stages that viruses must move through to survive and reproduce?\n    - A: Contact, mutation, and transmission\n    - B: Infection, replication, and adaptation\n    - C: Contact with a susceptible host, infection and replication, and transmission to other individuals\n    - D: Replication, transmission, and host jump\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the potential result of cross-species infections, or viral host jumps?\n    - A: The production of new vaccines\n    - B: The development of new treatments\n    - C: The potential to produce deadly epidemics\n    - D: The creation of new viruses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) Why is it difficult for a virus to infect a new species?\n    - A: Because viruses are highly adaptable\n    - B: Because viruses can rapidly develop random mutations\n    - C: Because of the genetic dissimilarity between two hosts\n    - D: Because viruses are highly contagious\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How can understanding how viruses infect and replicate within hosts inform public health strategies?\n    - A: By identifying potential epidemics\n    - B: By developing new treatments\n    - C: By informing the development of vaccines and containment protocols\n    - D: By monitoring populations for new outbreaks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is one way that studying the biology of viruses can help researchers?\n    - A: By identifying new viruses\n    - B: By developing new vaccines\n    - C: By identifying potential epidemics and developing strategies to prevent them\n    - D: By understanding the genetic similarity between hosts and viruses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the genetic similarity of two hosts and the ability of a virus to infect a new species?\n    - A: The more genetically similar the hosts, the less likely the virus is to infect the new species\n    - B: The more genetically similar the hosts, the more likely the virus is to infect the new species\n    - C: The genetic similarity of the hosts has no effect on the ability of the virus to infect the new species\n    - D: The less genetically similar the hosts, the more likely the virus is to infect the new species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the rapid reproduction of viruses and the development of random mutations?\n    - A: The rapid reproduction of viruses leads to a decrease in random mutations\n    - B: The rapid reproduction of viruses has no effect on the development of random mutations\n    - C: The rapid reproduction of viruses leads to an increase in random mutations that can enable them to better infect a new species\n    - D: The rapid reproduction of viruses leads to a decrease in the ability of the virus to infect a new species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can combining the understanding of how viruses infect and replicate within hosts with the knowledge of how viruses can rapidly develop random mutations inform public health strategies?\n    - A: By identifying potential epidemics\n    - B: By developing new treatments\n    - C: By informing the development of vaccines and containment protocols\n    - D: By understanding the genetic similarity between hosts and viruses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is one way that integrating the study of the biology of viruses with the monitoring of populations for new outbreaks can help researchers?\n    - A: By identifying new viruses\n    - B: By developing new vaccines\n    - C: By quickly identifying and responding to emerging epidemics\n    - D: By understanding the genetic similarity between hosts and viruses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is one way to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines and containment protocols in preventing the spread of deadly diseases?\n    - A: By monitoring populations for new outbreaks\n    - B: By studying the biology of viruses\n    - C: By tracking the number of cases and deaths from the disease\n    - D: By understanding the genetic similarity between hosts and viruses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is one way to justify the need for continued research into the biology of viruses and the development of strategies to prevent epidemics?\n    - A: By citing the high cost of research\n    - B: By citing the potential risks of research\n    - C: By citing the potential benefits of research, such as saving lives and preventing economic losses\n    - D: By citing the lack of progress in research\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to some questions to improve clarity and concision. I also ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. No major changes were necessary, and the questions align well with the key concepts in the transcript."
