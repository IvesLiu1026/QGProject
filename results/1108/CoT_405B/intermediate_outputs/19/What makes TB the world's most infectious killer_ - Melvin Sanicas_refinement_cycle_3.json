    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript and feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) What is the name of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB)?\n    - A: Mycobacterium pneumoniae\n    - B: Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n    - C: Streptococcus pneumoniae\n    - D: Haemophilus influenzae\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) In what year was the BCG vaccine developed to battle TB?\n    - A: 1882\n    - B: 1895\n    - C: 1921\n    - D: 2008\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) How is tuberculosis (TB) typically spread?\n    - A: Through contaminated food and water\n    - B: Through direct contact with an infected person\n    - C: Through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes\n    - D: Through insect vectors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is the typical response of the immune system to TB infection?\n    - A: The immune system ignores the bacteria, allowing them to multiply freely\n    - B: The immune system sends macrophages to absorb and break down the bacteria\n    - C: The immune system produces antibodies to neutralize the bacteria\n    - D: The immune system triggers an allergic reaction to eliminate the bacteria\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) A healthcare worker is caring for a patient with active TB in a crowded hospital ward. What is the most effective way to prevent the spread of TB to other patients and healthcare workers?\n    - A: Providing the patient with a surgical mask to wear at all times\n    - B: Isolating the patient in a negative-pressure room\n    - C: Administering antibiotics to all patients and healthcare workers on the ward\n    - D: Restricting visitation to the patient\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What is the most effective strategy to reduce the incidence of TB in a poverty-stricken neighborhood?\n    - A: Providing free TB testing and treatment to all residents\n    - B: Conducting educational campaigns to raise awareness about TB prevention and treatment\n    - C: Improving access to nutritious food and clean water\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) How does poverty contribute to the spread of TB?\n    - A: Poverty has no impact on the spread of TB\n    - B: Poverty increases the risk of developing TB, but does not affect its spread\n    - C: Poverty weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to TB\n    - D: Poverty contributes to the spread of TB by increasing crowding and poor living conditions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined to make option C more accurate and clear.\n\n8) This question is removed due to duplication with question 7.\n\n9) What is the main difference between latent and active TB?\n    - A: Latent TB is more contagious than active TB\n    - B: Latent TB has no symptoms, while active TB has noticeable symptoms\n    - C: Latent TB is more easily treatable than active TB\n    - D: Latent TB is a different strain of the bacteria than active TB\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What are the potential benefits of a comprehensive TB control program that includes vaccination, screening, and treatment?\n    - A: Reduced costs associated with TB treatment\n    - B: Improved patient outcomes and reduced transmission of TB\n    - C: Increased access to healthcare services for marginalized populations\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What are the potential advantages of using mobile health apps to improve TB diagnosis and treatment?\n    - A: Increased access to healthcare services for rural populations\n    - B: Improved patient adherence to treatment regimens\n    - C: Enhanced data collection and analysis for TB surveillance\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What are the potential limitations of using a new oral treatment for TB?\n    - A: The treatment may not be effective against all strains of TB\n    - B: The treatment may have significant side effects or interactions with other medications\n    - C: The treatment may be more expensive than existing options\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n13) What is a key ethical consideration when allocating resources for TB treatment and prevention in a resource-constrained setting?\n    - A: Prioritizing treatment for those who are most likely to benefit\n    - B: Prioritizing prevention efforts to reduce the incidence of TB\n    - C: Prioritizing treatment for those who are most vulnerable or marginalized\n    - D: Prioritizing cost-effectiveness in allocating resources\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n14) Who identified the bacterial origins of TB in 1882?\n    - A: Robert Koch\n    - B: Wilhelm Roentgen\n    - C: Louis Pasteur\n    - D: Alexander Fleming\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make the question more concise.\n\n15) Who discovered the X-ray in 1895, enabling physicians to diagnose and track TB progression?\n    - A: Wilhelm Roentgen\n    - B: Robert Koch\n    - C: Louis Pasteur\n    - D: Alexander Fleming\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make the question more concise.\n\n16) What percentage of people infected with TB do not show any symptoms?\n    - A: 50%\n    - B: 70%\n    - C: 80%\n    - D: 90%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed."
