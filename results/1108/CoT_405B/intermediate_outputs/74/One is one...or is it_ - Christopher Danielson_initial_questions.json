How much would it cost to buy 3 dozen eggs?\n    - A: $4\n    - B: $5\n    - C: $6\n    - D: $8\n[Correct answer]: C (This question requires the application of the concept of units, specifically composing units, to solve a real-world problem.)\n\n2) A pizza is cut into 8 slices. If Sara eats 2 slices, what fraction of the pizza has she eaten?\n    - A: 1/4\n    - B: 1/2\n    - C: 1/8\n    - D: 2/8\n[Correct answer]: D (This question requires the application of the concept of units, specifically partitioning units, to solve a real-world problem.)\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between composing and partitioning units?\n    - A: They are identical operations\n    - B: They are inverse operations\n    - C: They are only used in whole number place value\n    - D: They are only used in decimal place value\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What does the concept of units highlight about mathematical concepts?\n    - A: That they are always absolute\n    - B: That they are only used in real-world scenarios\n    - C: That they are dependent on the situation\n    - D: That they are only used in fractions and decimals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) How can combining the concepts of composing and partitioning units lead to a deeper understanding of mathematical operations?\n    - A: By only using addition and subtraction\n    - B: By only using multiplication and division\n    - C: By recognizing the inverse relationship between the two operations\n    - D: By only using fractions and decimals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a potential benefit of connecting the concept of units to other mathematical concepts, such as ratios and proportions?\n    - A: It can lead to confusion among students\n    - B: It can limit the use of mathematical operations\n    - C: It can help students develop a more nuanced understanding of mathematical concepts\n    - D: It can only be used in real-world scenarios\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) How can the effectiveness of using real-world examples to illustrate the concept of units be evaluated?\n    - A: Based on its ability to confuse students\n    - B: Based on its ability to engage students and promote understanding\n    - C: Based on its ability to limit the use of mathematical operations\n    - D: Based on its ability to only use fractions and decimals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a potential implication of the speaker's claim that mathematical concepts are not always absolute?\n    - A: It can lead to a lack of critical thinking among students\n    - B: It can limit the use of mathematical operations\n    - C: It can promote flexibility and adaptability in problem-solving\n    - D: It can only be used in real-world scenarios\n[Correct answer]: C"
