What could be a potential solution to mitigate this issue?\n    - A: Building more roads and increasing infrastructure\n    - B: Implementing a green infrastructure plan and using natural systems\n    - C: Increasing the city's population density and urbanization\n    - D: Reducing public transportation options and promoting private vehicles\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes made.\n\n7) What is the relationship between deforestation and climate change?\n    - A: Deforestation leads to an increase in oxygen production and carbon sequestration\n    - B: Deforestation contributes to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and climate change\n    - C: Deforestation results in the loss of carbon sinks and increased greenhouse gas emissions\n    - D: Deforestation has no impact on climate change and the environment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes made.\n\n8) What is a key difference between renewable and non-renewable energy sources?\n    - A: Renewable energy sources are more expensive and less efficient\n    - B: Renewable energy sources are sustainable and abundant, while non-renewable sources are finite\n    - C: Renewable energy sources produce more greenhouse gas emissions and pollution\n    - D: Renewable energy sources are less reliable and intermittent\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness.\n\n9) How can combining solar power and energy storage technologies address the issue of intermittent renewable energy sources?\n    - A: By reducing the overall energy production and capacity\n    - B: By increasing the reliance on non-renewable energy sources and fossil fuels\n    - C: By providing a stable and reliable source of renewable energy\n    - D: By decreasing the efficiency of the energy grid and transmission\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes made.\n\n10) What potential new perspective could emerge from considering the intersection of environmental sustainability and social justice?\n    - A: The prioritization of economic growth over environmental concerns and social welfare\n    - B: The recognition of the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on marginalized communities\n    - C: The emphasis on individual actions and personal responsibility over collective action\n    - D: The dismissal of the importance of environmental sustainability and social justice\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes made.\n\n11) What is a valid critique of the current approach to addressing climate change?\n    - A: It is too focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change\n    - B: It does not prioritize economic growth and job creation\n    - C: It relies too heavily on individual actions rather than systemic change and policy solutions\n    - D: It is too alarmist and exaggerates the severity of the issue and its impacts\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes made.\n\n12) How can the effectiveness of environmental policies be evaluated?\n    - A: By measuring the increase in economic growth and job creation\n    - B: By assessing the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts\n    - C: By counting the number of new policies implemented and regulations enacted\n    - D: By ignoring the impact on marginalized communities and vulnerable populations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes made.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
