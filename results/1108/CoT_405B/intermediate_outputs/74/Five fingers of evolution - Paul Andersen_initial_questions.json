    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge:**\n\n1) What is the basic unit of heredity?\n    - A: Chromosome\n    - B: Gene\n    - C: Cell\n    - D: Organism\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the term for small changes in a population over time?\n    - A: Macroevolution\n    - B: Microevolution\n    - C: Genetic drift\n    - D: Gene flow\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1) Which process creates organisms better adapted to their local environment?\n    - A: Genetic drift\n    - B: Non-random mating\n    - C: Mutation\n    - D: Natural selection\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is the analogy used to understand the concept of evolution?\n    - A: A deck of cards being shuffled and passed to the next generation\n    - B: A tree branching out into different species\n    - C: A river flowing through different environments\n    - D: A mountain range forming over time\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Application:**\n\n1) A population of birds migrates to a new island, resulting in a change in the gene pool. Which process of evolution is this an example of?\n    - A: Genetic drift\n    - B: Non-random mating\n    - C: Mutation\n    - D: Gene flow\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) A species of bacteria adapts to a new antibiotic, resulting in a change in its gene pool. Which process of evolution is this an example of?\n    - A: Genetic drift\n    - B: Non-random mating\n    - C: Mutation\n    - D: Natural selection\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1) What is the relationship between genetic variation and the potential for evolution to occur?\n    - A: Genetic variation decreases the potential for evolution\n    - B: Genetic variation has no effect on the potential for evolution\n    - C: Genetic variation increases the potential for evolution\n    - D: Genetic variation is the only factor that determines the potential for evolution\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the contrast between microevolution and macroevolution?\n    - A: Microevolution refers to large changes in a population over time, while macroevolution refers to small changes\n    - B: Microevolution refers to small changes in a population over time, while macroevolution refers to the formation of new species\n    - C: Microevolution refers to changes in a single species, while macroevolution refers to changes in multiple species\n    - D: Microevolution refers to changes in a population over a short period of time, while macroevolution refers to changes over a long period of time\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1) How do genetic drift, non-random mating, mutation, gene flow, and natural selection interact to influence the evolution of a population?\n    - A: They work together to increase genetic variation\n    - B: They work together to decrease genetic variation\n    - C: They work together to create a new species\n    - D: They interact in complex ways to shape the evolution of a population\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How do microevolution and macroevolution relate to each other?\n    - A: Microevolution leads to macroevolution\n    - B: Macroevolution leads to microevolution\n    - C: Microevolution and macroevolution are separate processes\n    - D: Microevolution and macroevolution are the same process\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1) What is the role of natural selection in shaping the adaptation of organisms to their environments?\n    - A: Natural selection is the only factor that determines adaptation\n    - B: Natural selection is one of several factors that determines adaptation\n    - C: Natural selection has no effect on adaptation\n    - D: Natural selection decreases adaptation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Is evolution a random process?\n    - A: Yes, evolution is completely random\n    - B: No, evolution is shaped by various factors, including natural selection\n    - C: Evolution is random, but only in certain situations\n    - D: Evolution is not random, but it is unpredictable\n[Correct answer]: B"
