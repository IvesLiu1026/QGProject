However, I can guide you through the process of how the analysis would be done if the transcript were provided.\n\nHere's a general outline of how to analyze a transcript using Bloom's Taxonomy levels:\n\n### 1. Knowledge\n- Identify specific names, dates, and events mentioned in the transcript.\n- List any definitions or explanations of key terms.\n- Note any statistics, data, or research findings mentioned.\n\n### 2. Comprehension\n- Summarize the main ideas or arguments presented in the transcript.\n- Identify any comparisons, analogies, or metaphors used to explain concepts.\n- Note any explanations of processes, systems, or cycles.\n\n### 3.
