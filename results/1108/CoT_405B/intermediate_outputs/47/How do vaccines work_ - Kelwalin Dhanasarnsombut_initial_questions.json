    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level based on the content analysis:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) Who created the first vaccine in 1796 using material from a cowpox virus?\n    - A: Louis Pasteur\n    - B: Edward Jenner\n    - C: Robert Koch\n    - D: Jonas Salk\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What type of vaccine is made from a weakened version of the pathogen?\n    - A: Inactive vaccine\n    - B: Live attenuated vaccine\n    - C: Subunit vaccine\n    - D: DNA vaccine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) How do vaccines work to defend against contagious diseases?\n    - A: By triggering a series of responses to identify and remove foreign microbes after someone gets ill\n    - B: By preparing the body's immune response before someone gets ill, using the same principles as the body's natural defense\n    - C: By creating a barrier to prevent foreign microbes from entering the body\n    - D: By killing foreign microbes directly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the main reason why vaccines are important for the body's defense against pathogens?\n    - A: Because they provide immediate protection against pathogens\n    - B: Because they take time to learn how to respond to pathogens and build up defenses\n    - C: Because they can cure diseases caused by pathogens\n    - D: Because they can prevent all types of diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-World Scenarios)**\n\n1) What is a potential use of DNA vaccines in the field of medicine?\n    - A: To treat diseases like HIV, malaria, or Ebola\n    - B: To prevent outbreaks of diseases like smallpox\n    - C: To protect people with weakened immune systems, such as the elderly or young children\n    - D: To develop new treatments for invasive pathogens\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Who may benefit from vaccines to protect against diseases due to weakened immune systems?\n    - A: Healthcare workers\n    - B: Schoolchildren\n    - C: The elderly or young children\n    - D: Athletes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, Contrasts, Cause-and-Effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between vaccines and the immune system?\n    - A: Vaccines work by triggering the body's innate immune system\n    - B: Vaccines work by triggering the body's adaptive immune system\n    - C: Vaccines work by suppressing the body's immune system\n    - D: Vaccines work by bypassing the body's immune system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the main difference between live attenuated and inactive vaccines?\n    - A: Live attenuated vaccines are made from killed pathogens, while inactive vaccines are made from weakened pathogens\n    - B: Live attenuated vaccines are made from weakened pathogens, while inactive vaccines are made from killed pathogens\n    - C: Live attenuated vaccines provide long-lasting immunity, while inactive vaccines do not\n    - D: Live attenuated vaccines are easier to make than inactive vaccines\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1) How do DNA vaccines work to trigger an immune response?\n    - A: By instructing cells to make antibodies\n    - B: By instructing cells to make antigens\n    - C: By suppressing the body's immune system\n    - D: By bypassing the body's immune system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a potential benefit of combining the concept of adaptive immunity with the idea of vaccines?\n    - A: It could lead to the development of personalized vaccines that target specific antigens\n    - B: It could lead to the development of vaccines that provide immediate protection against pathogens\n    - C: It could lead to the development of vaccines that can cure diseases caused by pathogens\n    - D: It could lead to the development of vaccines that can prevent all types of diseases\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, Critique, Justification)**\n\n1) Which type of vaccine is most effective in preventing outbreaks of diseases?\n    - A: Live attenuated vaccine\n    - B: Inactive vaccine\n    - C: Subunit vaccine\n    - D: It depends on the specific disease and population being vaccinated\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is a potential justification for making vaccines mandatory for certain populations, such as healthcare workers or schoolchildren?\n    - A: To protect their individual health and well-being\n    - B: To prevent the spread of diseases in vulnerable populations\n    - C: To reduce the economic burden of vaccine-preventable diseases\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D"
