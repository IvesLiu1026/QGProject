    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the name of the crater in Mexico that was formed by an asteroid impact, which is believed to have led to the extinction of the dinosaurs?\n    - A: Chelyabinsk crater\n    - B: Chicxulub crater\n    - C: Yucatan crater\n    - D: Acapulco crater\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the proposed spacecraft mission to detect and track near-Earth asteroids?\n    - A: Sentinel spacecraft\n    - B: Laser Bees spacecraft\n    - C: Asteroid Tracker spacecraft\n    - D: Spacewatch spacecraft\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) Why is it crucial to detect and track near-Earth asteroids?\n    - A: To study the composition of asteroids\n    - B: To prevent potential impacts that could cause significant damage or extinction\n    - C: To understand the formation of the solar system\n    - D: To search for extraterrestrial life\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the main goal of the Laser Bees concept in asteroid deflection?\n    - A: To deflect an asteroid using a rocket\n    - B: To vaporize the surface of an asteroid and change its speed using a swarm of sunlight-powered lasers\n    - C: To study the effects of asteroid impacts\n    - D: To develop a new propulsion system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a crucial step in protecting the planet from asteroid impacts?\n    - A: Developing a system to detect and track near-Earth asteroids\n    - B: Studying the composition of asteroids\n    - C: Understanding the effects of asteroid impacts\n    - D: Searching for extraterrestrial life\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) How does the size of an asteroid relate to the potential damage it could cause upon impact?\n    - A: Larger asteroids cause less damage\n    - B: Smaller asteroids cause more damage\n    - C: Larger asteroids cause more damage\n    - D: There is no relationship between asteroid size and impact damage\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the advantage of using a swarm of sunlight-powered lasers, like the Laser Bees concept, to deflect an asteroid?\n    - A: It requires a large amount of fuel\n    - B: It can only be used for small asteroids\n    - C: It can be more effective and efficient than using a single rocket or spacecraft\n    - D: It is only effective for asteroids with a specific composition\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) Why is it challenging to detect and track near-Earth asteroids?\n    - A: Because they are too large and bright\n    - B: Because they are too small and faint\n    - C: Because they are too fast and unpredictable\n    - D: Because they are too far away and inaccessible\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can data from multiple sources be used to improve asteroid detection and tracking?\n    - A: By combining data from multiple sources to create a more comprehensive picture\n    - B: By using data from a single source to make predictions\n    - C: By ignoring data from multiple sources and relying on intuition\n    - D: By using data from multiple sources to create conflicting predictions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What could be the result of integrating different asteroid deflection methods?\n    - A: A less effective system for preventing asteroid impacts\n    - B: A more effective system for preventing asteroid impacts\n    - C: A system that is equally effective as using a single deflection method\n    - D: A system that is only effective for small asteroids\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What should be considered when assessing the feasibility of different asteroid deflection methods?\n    - A: Only the cost of the method\n    - B: Only the effectiveness of the method\n    - C: Both the cost and effectiveness of the method\n    - D: Neither the cost nor effectiveness of the method\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is it essential to evaluate the effectiveness of current asteroid detection and tracking systems?\n    - A: To identify areas for improvement and optimize the systems\n    - B: To prove that the current systems are effective\n    - C: To disprove that the current systems are effective\n    - D: To ignore the current systems and develop new ones\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-5 and 11-12, as they are already clear and concise. Questions 6-10 have been refined to better align with the key concepts in the transcript and to have more plausible but incorrect distractors."
