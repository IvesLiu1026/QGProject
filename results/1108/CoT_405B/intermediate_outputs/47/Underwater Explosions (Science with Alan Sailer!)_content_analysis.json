The camera used is a M320 Miro Phantom camera.\n4. An explosion is defined as a rapid formation of gas contained in a mechanical device that increases pressure.\n5. Cavitation is the formation of bubbles in a liquid due to a decrease in pressure.\n6. A phase diagram is a chart that describes the state of matter based on pressure and temperature.\n7. Super cavitation is a technique used by the Russians to create a bubble on the front of a torpedo to reduce drag.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The experiment involves detonating firecrackers underwater to study explosions.\n2. The goal of the experiment is to understand why the bottle is sucked in on the top instead of blown out.\n3. The concept of cavitation is crucial in understanding the phenomenon observed in the experiment.\n4. The phase diagram is used to explain how the pressure and temperature affect the state of the water.\n5. The experiment shows that the shock waves bouncing off the sides of the bottle create a low-pressure spot.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. High-speed photography can be used to study explosions in various fields, such as engineering or physics.\n2.
