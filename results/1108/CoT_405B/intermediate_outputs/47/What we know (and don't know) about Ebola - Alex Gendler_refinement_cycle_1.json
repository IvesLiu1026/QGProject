    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In what year was the Ebola virus first identified in a mysterious epidemic in central Africa?\n    - A: 1974\n    - B: 1976\n    - C: 1978\n    - D: 1980\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What animal is believed to be the natural carrier of the Ebola virus?\n    - A: Fruit flies\n    - B: Fruit bats\n    - C: Mosquitoes\n    - D: Ticks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) How does the Ebola virus initially affect the immune system's cells?\n    - A: It strengthens their responses\n    - B: It neutralizes their responses\n    - C: It has no effect on their responses\n    - D: It weakens their responses temporarily\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the result of the cytokine storm caused by the Ebola virus?\n    - A: It repairs damaged blood vessels\n    - B: It damages blood vessels, causing internal and external bleeding\n    - C: It has no effect on blood vessels\n    - D: It strengthens the immune system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is an effective way to prevent the spread of Ebola in a community?\n    - A: Isolation and sanitation\n    - B: Vaccination only\n    - C: Antibiotic treatment\n    - D: Increased travel\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) Why is it essential to properly clean and disinfect surfaces in areas where Ebola is present?\n    - A: Because Ebola can only survive on surfaces for a few minutes\n    - B: Because Ebola can survive on surfaces for several hours\n    - C: Because Ebola is only spread through bodily fluids\n    - D: Because Ebola is only spread through the air\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the viral load and the severity of Ebola?\n    - A: The severity of the disease decreases as the viral load increases\n    - B: The severity of the disease increases as the viral load decreases\n    - C: The severity of the disease is not related to the viral load\n    - D: The severity of the disease increases directly with the viral load\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) Why is Ebola considered highly virulent but relatively low in contagiousness?\n    - A: Because it is only spread through bodily fluids\n    - B: Because it is only spread through the air\n    - C: Because several factors limit its contagiousness, including its transmission through bodily fluids\n    - D: Because it is highly contagious but not very virulent\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a potential strategy for containing an Ebola outbreak?\n    - A: Isolation and sanitation, combined with vaccination\n    - B: Isolation and sanitation, combined with antibiotic treatment\n    - C: Vaccination only\n    - D: Isolation and sanitation only\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What could be a potential solution for addressing the economic and infrastructure challenges in regions where Ebola outbreaks occur?\n    - A: Investing in research and development of Ebola treatments and vaccines\n    - B: Increasing travel restrictions\n    - C: Implementing innovative solutions for research and development, and investing in local infrastructure\n    - D: Providing only humanitarian aid\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) How can the effectiveness of current treatments for Ebola be evaluated?\n    - A: By their impact on the economy\n    - B: By their impact on mortality rates\n    - C: By their impact on the environment\n    - D: By their impact on the healthcare system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What should be considered when evaluating the decision to invest in research and development of Ebola treatments and vaccines?\n    - A: Only the economic implications\n    - B: Only the social implications\n    - C: Both the economic and social implications\n    - D: Neither the economic nor social implications\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made some minor adjustments to questions 8, 10, and 12 to improve clarity and concision. No significant changes were made to the other questions, as they already aligned with the key concepts and had plausible but incorrect distractors."
