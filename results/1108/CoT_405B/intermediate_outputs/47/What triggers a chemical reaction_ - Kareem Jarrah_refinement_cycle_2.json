Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What term describes the increase or decrease of energy during a chemical reaction?\n    - A: Entropy\n    - B: Enthalpy\n    - C: Chemical potential energy\n    - D: Reaction rate\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which type of reaction releases energy into the surroundings?\n    - A: Endothermic reaction\n    - B: Exothermic reaction\n    - C: Chemical reaction\n    - D: Physical reaction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the relationship between enthalpy and entropy in chemical reactions?\n    - A: They are directly proportional to each other\n    - B: They are inversely proportional to each other\n    - C: They are two independent factors that influence chemical reactions\n    - D: They are the same concept\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) Why are exothermic reactions more likely to occur than endothermic reactions?\n    - A: Because they require more energy to initiate\n    - B: Because they require less energy to initiate\n    - C: Because they release more energy\n    - D: Because they absorb more energy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What type of reaction occurs when baking a cake in the oven?\n    - A: Exothermic reaction\n    - B: Endothermic reaction\n    - C: Chemical reaction\n    - D: Physical reaction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the role of energy from the match when lighting a campfire?\n    - A: The energy is used to cook food directly\n    - B: The energy is used to activate the exothermic reaction of combustion\n    - C: The energy is used to power a machine\n    - D: The energy is used to extinguish the fire\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How does the energy change during a reaction affect its likelihood of occurring?\n    - A: The energy change has no effect on the likelihood of the reaction\n    - B: The energy change directly affects the likelihood of the reaction\n    - C: The energy change indirectly affects the likelihood of the reaction\n    - D: The energy change is the only factor that affects the likelihood of the reaction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the main difference between exothermic and endothermic reactions?\n    - A: Exothermic reactions release energy, while endothermic reactions absorb energy\n    - B: Exothermic reactions absorb energy, while endothermic reactions release energy\n    - C: Exothermic reactions require more energy, while endothermic reactions require less energy\n    - D: Exothermic reactions occur at higher temperatures, while endothermic reactions occur at lower temperatures\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) How do enthalpy and entropy interact to influence the likelihood of a reaction?\n    - A: Enthalpy and entropy are directly proportional to each other and both increase the likelihood of a reaction\n    - B: Enthalpy and entropy are inversely proportional to each other and one increases the likelihood of a reaction while the other decreases it\n    - C: Enthalpy and entropy are two independent factors that interact to influence the likelihood of a reaction\n    - D: Enthalpy and entropy have no effect on the likelihood of a reaction\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How can understanding chemical reactions be applied to everyday experiences?\n    - A: By recognizing the role of enthalpy and entropy in everyday processes, such as baking or cooking\n    - B: By ignoring the role of enthalpy and entropy in everyday processes\n    - C: By applying chemical reactions to only industrial processes\n    - D: By applying chemical reactions to only laboratory experiments\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How can the likelihood of a reaction be predicted?\n    - A: By evaluating only the enthalpy change during the reaction\n    - B: By evaluating only the entropy change during the reaction\n    - C: By evaluating both the enthalpy and entropy changes during the reaction\n    - D: By ignoring the enthalpy and entropy changes during the reaction\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the role of energy in chemical reactions?\n    - A: Energy is only used to initiate reactions\n    - B: Energy is only used to sustain reactions\n    - C: Energy is used to both initiate and sustain reactions, and its usage can be optimized\n    - D: Energy is not used in chemical reactions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
