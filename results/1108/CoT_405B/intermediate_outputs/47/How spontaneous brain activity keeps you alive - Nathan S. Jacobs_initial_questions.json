    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) What is the primary function of the brain's autopilot function?\n    - A: To control voluntary movements\n    - B: To regulate emotions\n    - C: To control basic biological functions such as breathing and swallowing\n    - D: To facilitate complex decision-making\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a characteristic of REM sleep?\n    - A: Slow eye movements and steady brain activity\n    - B: Rapid eye movements and varied bursts of brain activity\n    - C: No eye movements and minimal brain activity\n    - D: Constant eye movements and steady brain activity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) What is the role of the brain's spontaneous activity in maintaining basic biological functions?\n    - A: It is only necessary for complex tasks\n    - B: It is not necessary for basic biological functions\n    - C: It is essential for maintaining basic biological functions\n    - D: It is only necessary for conscious awareness\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the relationship between the brain's autopilot function and conscious awareness?\n    - A: The autopilot function is only active during conscious awareness\n    - B: The autopilot function is not related to conscious awareness\n    - C: The autopilot function can take over complex tasks without conscious awareness\n    - D: The autopilot function is only necessary for simple tasks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application**\n\n1) A person is able to drive home from work without consciously thinking about the route. What brain function is most likely responsible for this ability?\n    - A: Conscious awareness\n    - B: Autopilot function\n    - C: Sensory perception\n    - D: Motor control\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why is sleep essential for cognitive function?\n    - A: It allows the brain to rest and recover\n    - B: It strengthens memory and rejuvenates cognitive capacity\n    - C: It only helps with physical recovery\n    - D: It is not essential for cognitive function\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the brain's spontaneous activity during sleep and wakefulness?\n    - A: The activity is the same during both states\n    - B: The activity is more synchronized and rhythmic during wakefulness\n    - C: The activity is more synchronized and rhythmic during sleep\n    - D: The activity is not related to sleep or wakefulness\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the role of the brain's autopilot function in motor control?\n    - A: It is only necessary for simple tasks\n    - B: It is not necessary for motor control\n    - C: It can coordinate complex tasks, such as walking\n    - D: It is only necessary for conscious awareness\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) How can the concepts of the brain's autopilot function and sleep be combined to explain complex behaviors?\n    - A: The autopilot function is only active during sleep\n    - B: The autopilot function can take over complex tasks during sleep\n    - C: The autopilot function can accomplish complex tasks, such as driving, without conscious awareness, and sleep helps to rejuvenate this function\n    - D: The autopilot function is not related to sleep\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How can the ideas of neural activity and sensory perception be integrated to explain how the brain interprets and responds to signals?\n    - A: Neural activity is not necessary for sensory perception\n    - B: Sensory perception is only necessary for conscious awareness\n    - C: Neural activity helps to interpret and respond to signals, which is essential for sensory perception\n    - D: Neural activity is only necessary for motor control\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) Why is the brain's autopilot function important for maintaining basic biological functions and coordinating complex tasks?\n    - A: It is not important for these functions\n    - B: It is only necessary for simple tasks\n    - C: It is essential for maintaining basic biological functions and coordinating complex tasks, allowing for efficient and automatic control\n    - D: It is only necessary for conscious awareness\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the significance of sleep and the brain's spontaneous activity during sleep in rejuvenating cognitive capacity, cellular homeostasis, and strengthening memory?\n    - A: Sleep is not necessary for cognitive function\n    - B: Sleep only helps with physical recovery\n    - C: Sleep is essential for rejuvenating cognitive capacity, cellular homeostasis, and strengthening memory, and the brain's spontaneous activity during sleep plays a critical role in this process\n    - D: Sleep is only necessary for conscious awareness\n[Correct answer]: C"
