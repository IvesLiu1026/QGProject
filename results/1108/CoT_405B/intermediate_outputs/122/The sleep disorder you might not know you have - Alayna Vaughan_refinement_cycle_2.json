    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript and initial set of questions, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are estimated to be unaware they have it?\n    - A: 20%\n    - B: 40%\n    - C: 80%\n    - D: 90%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the primary cause of central sleep apnea?\n    - A: Blockages in the airway\n    - B: The brain temporarily failing to regulate breathing\n    - C: Larger tongues and thicker necks\n    - D: Congestion and anatomical features\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What happens to the muscles around the respiratory tract during sleep?\n    - A: They become more rigid\n    - B: They relax and narrow the airway\n    - C: They expand and widen the airway\n    - D: They remain unchanged\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is a potential consequence of untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\n    - A: Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease\n    - B: Lower blood pressure\n    - C: Serious cardiovascular issues\n    - D: Improved breathing during sleep\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What should a person experiencing loud, chronic snoring do to address potential health concerns?\n    - A: Ignore the issue and hope it resolves itself\n    - B: Consult a doctor to rule out obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\n    - C: Try to lose weight without consulting a doctor\n    - D: Use a CPAP machine without consulting a doctor\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What are some potential solutions for alleviating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\n    - A: Gaining weight and avoiding exercise\n    - B: Limiting alcohol consumption before bed and elevating the head\n    - C: Avoiding exercise and physical activity\n    - D: Ignoring the condition and hoping it resolves itself\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\n    - A: Snoring is always caused by OSA\n    - B: Snoring is never caused by OSA\n    - C: Snoring can be a sign of OSA, but not all snoring is caused by OSA\n    - D: OSA is always caused by snoring\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the primary difference between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea?\n    - A: OSA is caused by the brain's failure to regulate breathing, while central sleep apnea is caused by blockages in the airway\n    - B: OSA is caused by blockages in the airway, while central sleep apnea is caused by the brain's failure to regulate breathing\n    - C: OSA is more common than central sleep apnea\n    - D: Central sleep apnea is more common than OSA\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What might be a comprehensive approach to treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\n    - A: Using a CPAP machine alone\n    - B: Losing weight alone\n    - C: A combination of weight loss, behavioral shifts, and devices like CPAP machines\n    - D: Ignoring the condition and hoping it resolves itself\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) Why is it essential to understand the relationship between snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\n    - A: So individuals can ignore the issue and hope it resolves itself\n    - B: So individuals can take proactive steps to address potential sleep disorders\n    - C: So individuals can use a CPAP machine without consulting a doctor\n    - D: So individuals can try to lose weight without consulting a doctor\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a potential drawback of using CPAP machines to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\n    - A: They are too effective and may cure OSA too quickly\n    - B: They may be uncomfortable to wear and can disrupt sleep patterns\n    - C: They are too inexpensive and may not be taken seriously\n    - D: They are only available for people with mild OSA\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Why is it crucial to address obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as a critical health issue?\n    - A: Because it can lead to serious cardiovascular issues if left untreated\n    - B: Because it is a minor condition that can be ignored\n    - C: Because it only affects older adults\n    - D: Because it is only caused by blockages in the airway\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefinements were made to improve clarity, conciseness, and to ensure that distractors are plausible but incorrect. Correct answers remain accurate. No more refinement needed."
