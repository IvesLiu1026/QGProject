    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is one of the historical treatments for snoring mentioned in the content?\n    - A: A leather mask that amplifies the sound of snoring\n    - B: A cannonball sewn into a soldier's uniform\n    - C: A machine that delivers soothing music to help sleep\n    - D: A device that monitors sleep patterns\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of people who suffer from obstructive sleep apnea are estimated to be unaware they have it?\n    - A: 20%\n    - B: 40%\n    - C: 60%\n    - D: 80%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What underlying condition can loud, chronic snoring be a sign of?\n    - A: Central sleep apnea\n    - B: Obstructive sleep apnea\n    - C: Insomnia\n    - D: Sleepwalking\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is a potential consequence of obstructive sleep apnea?\n    - A: Increased energy levels\n    - B: Improved concentration\n    - C: Serious cardiovascular issues\n    - D: Enhanced athletic performance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What should a person who experiences loud, chronic snoring do to address the issue?\n    - A: Ignore the snoring and hope it goes away\n    - B: Consult a doctor to rule out obstructive sleep apnea\n    - C: Try to sleep on their side instead of their back\n    - D: Use earplugs to block out the sound\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What behavioral shift can help alleviate obstructive sleep apnea?\n    - A: Drinking more alcohol before bed\n    - B: Limiting alcohol consumption before bed\n    - C: Eating a heavy meal before sleep\n    - D: Engaging in strenuous exercise before bed\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between snoring and obstructive sleep apnea?\n    - A: Snoring is a guaranteed indicator of obstructive sleep apnea\n    - B: Snoring is a potential sign of obstructive sleep apnea\n    - C: Snoring is unrelated to obstructive sleep apnea\n    - D: Snoring is a cure for obstructive sleep apnea\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the primary cause of central sleep apnea?\n    - A: Blockages in the airway\n    - B: The brain's failure to regulate breathing\n    - C: Weight gain\n    - D: Aging\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What combination of approaches can help alleviate obstructive sleep apnea?\n    - A: Weight loss, behavioral shifts, and medical treatments\n    - B: Weight gain, increased alcohol consumption, and ignoring the condition\n    - C: Only weight loss\n    - D: Only medical treatments\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is a potential consequence of not addressing sleep apnea?\n    - A: Improved overall health\n    - B: Reduced risk of cardiovascular issues\n    - C: Increased risk of cardiovascular issues and other health problems\n    - D: No impact on overall health\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) Why is it crucial to address sleep apnea?\n    - A: It is a minor condition with no significant consequences\n    - B: It is a serious condition that can have far-reaching consequences for overall health\n    - C: It is a condition that only affects older adults\n    - D: It is a condition that only affects people who are overweight\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What factors can contribute to the development of obstructive sleep apnea?\n    - A: Weight loss, smaller tongue, and larger jaw\n    - B: Weight gain, larger tongue, and smaller jaw\n    - C: Drinking less alcohol, sleeping on one's side, and having a smaller neck\n    - D: Engaging in strenuous exercise, eating a healthy diet, and having a larger airway\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 12 (evaluation of historical treatments) and 13 (importance of addressing sleep apnea, which is similar to question 11) to avoid duplication and ensure the questions are concise and relevant. I also removed question 14, as it is similar to question 12. The refined questions are clear, concise, and align with the key concepts in the transcript."
