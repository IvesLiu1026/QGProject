    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall of Specific Facts)**\n\n1. The speed of sound is approximately 1230 kilometers per hour.\n2. The Concorde jet was a supersonic plane that was in commercial service from the 1970s to 2003.\n3. The first human to successfully pilot an airplane was Orville Wright on December 17th, 1903.\n4. The Wright brothers' first flights lasted 12 seconds and 1 minute, respectively.\n5. The Bell X-1 was the first plane to break the sound barrier in 1947.\n6. The Concorde flew passengers from London to New York in about 3.5 hours.\n7. NASA is working on a project to dampen the effects of sonic booms.\n8. The Concorde 2 is a proposed supersonic plane that could fly at Mach 4.5.\n9. Hypersonic speeds are generally defined as Mach 5 or higher.\n10.
