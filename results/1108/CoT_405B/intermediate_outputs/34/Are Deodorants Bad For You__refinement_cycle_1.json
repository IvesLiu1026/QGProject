    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary cause of body odor?\n    - A: Overactive sweat glands\n    - B: Fatty oils in sweat\n    - C: Bacteria that feed on fatty oils in sweat\n    - D: Apocrine glands\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the name of the genotype associated with reduced body odor and a specific ear wax type?\n    - A: AB CC2\n    - B: AB CC1\n    - C: AB DD1\n    - D: AB EE1\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary difference between deodorants and antiperspirants in terms of their function?\n    - A: Deodorants reduce sweat, while antiperspirants mask the smell.\n    - B: Deodorants mask the smell, while antiperspirants reduce sweat.\n    - C: Deodorants and antiperspirants have the same function.\n    - D: Deodorants are used for men, while antiperspirants are used for women.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the role of genetics in determining body odor and ear wax type?\n    - A: Genetics plays no role in determining body odor and ear wax type.\n    - B: Genetics influences body odor but not ear wax type.\n    - C: Genetics influences ear wax type but not body odor.\n    - D: Genetics influences both body odor and ear wax type.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) A person with excessive body odor is considering using a deodorant or antiperspirant. Which option would be more effective for managing body odor in this scenario?\n    - A: Deodorant only\n    - B: Antiperspirant only\n    - C: Both deodorant and antiperspirant\n    - D: Neither deodorant nor antiperspirant\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) A person with the AB CC1 genotype is considering their personal hygiene practices. What might be a consideration for this individual?\n    - A: Using stronger deodorants and antiperspirants\n    - B: Using milder deodorants and antiperspirants\n    - C: Focusing on other aspects of personal hygiene\n    - D: Ignoring personal hygiene practices\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the AB CC1 genotype and body odor/ear wax type?\n    - A: The AB CC1 genotype is associated with increased body odor and wet ear wax.\n    - B: The AB CC1 genotype is associated with reduced body odor and dry ear wax.\n    - C: The AB CC1 genotype is associated with increased body odor and dry ear wax.\n    - D: The AB CC1 genotype is associated with reduced body odor and wet ear wax.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the difference in corini bacteria levels between men and women?\n    - A: Men have lower levels of corini bacteria than women.\n    - B: Men have higher levels of corini bacteria than women.\n    - C: Men and women have the same levels of corini bacteria.\n    - D: Corini bacteria levels are not related to sex.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How might the understanding of genetics and body odor be combined to develop new approaches to managing body odor?\n    - A: By creating personalized deodorants and antiperspirants based on genetic profiles\n    - B: By developing stronger deodorants and antiperspirants for everyone\n    - C: By ignoring genetic factors and focusing on other aspects of personal hygiene\n    - D: By using the same deodorants and antiperspirants for everyone\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What might be a potential benefit of integrating the knowledge of deodorant and antiperspirant functions?\n    - A: Developing more expensive deodorants and antiperspirants\n    - B: Developing more effective deodorants and antiperspirants\n    - C: Developing weaker deodorants and antiperspirants\n    - D: Ignoring the functions of deodorants and antiperspirants\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the current scientific consensus regarding the link between deodorant/antiperspirant ingredients and breast cancer/Alzheimer's?\n    - A: There is a proven link between deodorant/antiperspirant ingredients and breast cancer/Alzheimer's.\n    - B: There is no proven link between deodorant/antiperspirant ingredients and breast cancer/Alzheimer's.\n    - C: The link between deodorant/antiperspirant ingredients and breast cancer/Alzheimer's is still being researched.\n    - D: Deodorant/antiperspirant ingredients are the primary cause of breast cancer/Alzheimer's.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) How might the effectiveness of deodorants and antiperspirants in managing body odor be evaluated?\n    - A: By relying on anecdotal evidence and personal opinions\n    - B: By conducting rigorous scientific studies and gathering data\n    - C: By ignoring the effectiveness of deodorants and antiperspirants\n    - D: By assuming deodorants and antiperspirants are always effective\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-12. However, some minor adjustments were made to improve clarity and concision."
