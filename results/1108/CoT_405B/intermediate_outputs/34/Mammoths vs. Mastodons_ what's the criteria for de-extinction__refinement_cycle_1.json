    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how long ago did woolly mammoths widely disappear?\n    - A: 5,000 years ago\n    - B: 10,000 years ago\n    - C: 15,000 years ago\n    - D: 20,000 years ago\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the main difference in the molars of mammoths and mastodons?\n    - A: Mammoths have giant cusps, while mastodons have flat grinding surfaces.\n    - B: Mammoths have flat grinding surfaces, while mastodons have giant cusps.\n    - C: Mammoths have sharp teeth, while mastodons have dull teeth.\n    - D: Mammoths have small teeth, while mastodons have large teeth.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why is the woolly mammoth a candidate for de-extinction?\n    - A: Because its genetic information is poorly preserved.\n    - B: Because its genetic information is well-preserved in the permafrost.\n    - C: Because it is closely related to the African elephant.\n    - D: Because it is a well-studied species.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What can be inferred about the diets of mammoths and mastodons based on the shape of their teeth?\n    - A: Mammoths were browsers, and mastodons were grazers.\n    - B: Mammoths were grazers, and mastodons were browsers.\n    - C: Mammoths and mastodons had the same diet.\n    - D: The shape of their teeth does not provide any information about their diets.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential application of the concept of de-extinction?\n    - A: Studying the evolution of extinct species.\n    - B: Conserving endangered species on islands.\n    - C: Bringing back extinct species to modern ecosystems.\n    - D: Understanding the impact of environmental changes on species survival.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How can the understanding of island dwarfism be applied to conservation efforts?\n    - A: By introducing large predators to islands.\n    - B: By providing unlimited food resources to island species.\n    - C: By conserving species on islands and managing their habitats.\n    - D: By relocating island species to mainland habitats.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What can be inferred about the relationship between mammoths and mastodons based on their genetic differences?\n    - A: They are closely related species.\n    - B: They are distantly related species.\n    - C: They are the same species.\n    - D: Their genetic differences are not significant.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between island isolation and dwarfism?\n    - A: Island isolation leads to an increase in size due to abundant food resources.\n    - B: Island isolation leads to a decrease in size due to limited food resources and the absence of predators.\n    - C: Island isolation has no effect on the size of species.\n    - D: Island isolation leads to an increase in size due to the presence of predators.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be gained from combining genetic information and morphological characteristics in the study of extinct species?\n    - A: A comprehensive understanding of their evolution and survival.\n    - B: A limited understanding of their diets and habitats.\n    - C: A detailed understanding of their genetic differences.\n    - D: A superficial understanding of their morphological characteristics.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) How can the study of de-extinction lead to new insights into conservation efforts?\n    - A: By providing a better understanding of the technical challenges of de-extinction.\n    - B: By highlighting the ethics of de-extinction.\n    - C: By leading to new methods for preserving genetic information.\n    - D: By providing insights into the conservation of endangered species and the preservation of genetic information.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is a potential risk of introducing extinct species to modern ecosystems through de-extinction?\n    - A: The introduction of new predators to control prey populations.\n    - B: The disruption of delicate ecosystem balances.\n    - C: The creation of new habitats for endangered species.\n    - D: The preservation of genetic information for future generations.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a key consideration in evaluating the ethics of de-extinction?\n    - A: The technical feasibility of de-extinction.\n    - B: The potential consequences of introducing extinct species to modern ecosystems.\n    - C: The preservation of genetic information for future generations.\n    - D: The study of the evolution of extinct species.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
