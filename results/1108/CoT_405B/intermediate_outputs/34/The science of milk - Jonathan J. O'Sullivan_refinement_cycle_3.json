    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary function of milk in mammals?\n    - A: To provide hydration and aid in digestion\n    - B: To boost the immune system and support growth\n    - C: As a complete source of nutrition for newborns\n    - D: To regulate body temperature and support development\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined for clarity, but no changes made.\n\n2) What factors contribute to the unique makeup of milk in different species?\n    - A: Species and diet\n    - B: Location and climate\n    - C: Age and health of the mammal\n    - D: Species, diet, and location\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined option D to remove \"All of the above\" and list the specific factors.\n\n3) What is the process by which mammary glands produce milk?\n    - A: Respiration and digestion\n    - B: Photosynthesis and fermentation\n    - C: Lactation\n    - D: Hormone regulation and blood circulation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo changes made.\n\n4) Which type of mammal is commonly used for dairy production due to its easily domesticated nature and similar fat content to human milk?\n    - A: Goats and sheep\n    - B: Buffalo and yaks\n    - C: Cows\n    - D: Camels and horses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo changes made.\n\n5) What is the purpose of homogenization in milk processing?\n    - A: To separate fat from liquid and create cream\n    - B: To add flavor and nutrients to milk\n    - C: To create a uniform texture and prevent creaming\n    - D: To reduce microbial levels and extend shelf life\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined option C for clarity.\n\n6) Why is pasteurization used in milk processing?\n    - A: To improve its nutritional value and flavor\n    - B: To enhance its texture and appearance\n    - C: To reduce microbial levels and prevent spoilage\n    - D: To increase its shelf life and convenience\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined question for clarity.\n\n7) What is the main difference between ultra-high temperature (UHT) processing and regular pasteurization?\n    - A: UHT uses lower temperatures for a longer duration\n    - B: UHT uses higher temperatures for a shorter duration\n    - C: UHT is used for non-dairy products and regular pasteurization is used for dairy products\n    - D: UHT is a slower process and regular pasteurization is a faster process\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo changes made.\n\n8) What is the result of UHT processing on milk's shelf life and nutritional properties?\n    - A: UHT milk has a shorter shelf life and improved nutritional properties\n    - B: UHT milk has a longer shelf life and potentially reduced nutritional properties\n    - C: UHT milk has a longer shelf life and improved nutritional properties\n    - D: UHT milk has a shorter shelf life and reduced nutritional properties\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined option B to add \"potentially\" to reflect the transcript's statement that UHT processing \"may adversely affect\" nutritional properties."
