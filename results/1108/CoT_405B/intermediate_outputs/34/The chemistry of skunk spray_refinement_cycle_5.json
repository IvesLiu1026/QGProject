    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the Latin name of the striped skunk, which translates to \"foul stench\" or \"noxious vapor\"?\n    - A: Mephitis putrida\n    - B: Mephitis mephitis\n    - C: Skunkius odorifer\n    - D: Foulstenchius vaporius\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What type of chemical group, consisting of a sulfur and hydrogen atom bonded together, is found in skunk spray?\n    - A: Aldehydes\n    - B: Thiols\n    - C: Ethers\n    - D: Alcohols\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is primarily responsible for the distinctive smell of a skunk's defensive spray?\n    - A: The unique shape of the skunk's anal scent glands\n    - B: The presence of thioacetates in the spray\n    - C: The thiols present in the spray\n    - D: The combination of aldehydes and ethers\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the recommended method for removing skunk musk from skin or surfaces?\n    - A: Using tomato juice\n    - B: Applying a mixture of dilute hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and liquid soap\n    - C: Rinsing with hot water\n    - D: Using a strong detergent\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) If you encounter a skunk in the wild, what should you do to minimize the risk of getting sprayed?\n    - A: Approach the skunk slowly and carefully\n    - B: Recognize the warning signs, such as hissing and tail-raising, and back away slowly\n    - C: Try to scare the skunk away with loud noises\n    - D: Attempt to pet the skunk\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What happens to thioacetates in skunk spray when they are exposed to water?\n    - A: They are converted to a different type of compound\n    - B: They are converted to thiols\n    - C: They remain unchanged\n    - D: They are broken down into sulfur and hydrogen atoms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the purpose of a skunk's warning system, such as hissing and tail-raising?\n    - A: To scare away predators after spraying\n    - B: To signal to other skunks that it has already sprayed\n    - C: To warn potential threats before spraying\n    - D: To attract a mate\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a potential consequence of keeping skunks as pets without proper care and handling?\n    - A: A deeper understanding and appreciation of these animals, with no negative consequences\n    - B: Health risks for humans and stress for the animals\n    - C: A decline in the wild skunk population\n    - D: An increase in the demand for exotic animals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) Why is it not recommended to grab a skunk from the wild to keep as a pet?\n    - A: Because it may not be a striped skunk\n    - B: Because it may not be able to adapt to domestication\n    - C: Because it is not nice for the skunk and may cause stress\n    - D: Because it may not be able to produce musk\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nAfter reviewing the questions, I did not find any significant issues that would require major refinements. The questions align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Therefore, I conclude that:\n\nNo more refinement needed."
