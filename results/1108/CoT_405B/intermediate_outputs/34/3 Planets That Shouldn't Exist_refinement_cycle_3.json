    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How long have humans been studying astronomy?\n    - A: Since the invention of the telescope\n    - B: For as long as they have looked up at the night sky\n    - C: Since the discovery of exoplanets\n    - D: For the past century\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the estimated surface temperature of Kepler-78b?\n    - A: 1,000 Kelvin\n    - B: 2,000 Kelvin\n    - C: 3,100 Kelvin\n    - D: 4,000 Kelvin\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What makes the three exoplanets mentioned in the transcript unusual?\n    - A: They are similar in size to Earth\n    - B: They do not fit current theories of planetary formation\n    - C: They are all gas giants\n    - D: They are all located in the same galaxy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is Kepler-10c considered due to its large mass and small size?\n    - A: A mini-Earth\n    - B: A mega-Earth\n    - C: A gas giant\n    - D: A dwarf planet\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can studying exoplanets like Kepler-78b and Kepler-10c provide insights into?\n    - A: The formation and evolution of gas giants\n    - B: The potential for life on other planets and the conditions necessary for life to arise\n    - C: The composition of the Sun\n    - D: The formation and evolution of planetary systems\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) How can understanding the unusual characteristics of these exoplanets help scientists?\n    - A: By confirming their current theories of planetary formation\n    - B: By refining their theories of planetary formation\n    - C: By discovering new planets\n    - D: By studying the Sun\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What does the close orbit of Kepler-78b to its star suggest?\n    - A: That the planet formed in its current location\n    - B: That the planet may have formed farther away and migrated closer\n    - C: That the planet is a gas giant\n    - D: That the planet is similar to Earth\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is puzzling about Kepler-10c?\n    - A: Its small size\n    - B: Its large mass\n    - C: Its lack of a thick atmosphere despite its large mass\n    - D: Its close orbit to its star\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What does the discovery of these unusual exoplanets suggest?\n    - A: That current theories of planetary formation are correct\n    - B: That there may be other factors at play in planetary formation that are not yet understood\n    - C: That the universe is smaller than thought\n    - D: That there is no potential for life on other planets\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is unusual about the orbit of HD 106906 b?\n    - A: It is very close to its star\n    - B: It is very far from its star\n    - C: It is a highly eccentric orbit\n    - D: It is a perfectly circular orbit\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) How long does a year last on Kepler-78b?\n    - A: 365 days\n    - B: 8.5 hours\n    - C: 100 days\n    - D: 1,000 years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the estimated mass of Kepler-10c?\n    - A: 1-2 times the mass of Earth\n    - B: 5-10 times the mass of Earth\n    - C: 14-17 times the mass of Earth\n    - D: 20-30 times the mass of Earth\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 13-15 as they were redundant or not essential to the key concepts in the transcript. The refined questions are clear, concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. The correct answers are accurate and align with the key concepts in the transcript. No more refinement needed."
