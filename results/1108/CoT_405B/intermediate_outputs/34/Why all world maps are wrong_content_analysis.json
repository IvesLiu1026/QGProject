The surface of a sphere cannot be represented as a plane without some form of distortion.\n2. Mathematicians have been creating algorithms to translate the globe into a flat map since the 1500s.\n3. The process of translating the globe into a flat map is called projection.\n4. Popular rectangular maps use cylindrical projections.\n5. The Mercator projection preserves direction and shape but distorts size.\n6. The Gall-Peters projection is an equal-area map that accurately displays size but distorts shape.\n7. The Winkel tripel projection is used by the National Geographic Society for its balance between size and shape accuracy.\n8. Satellites and GPS technology changed the purpose of mapping and the way we think about projections.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The eternal dilemma of map makers is representing the surface of a sphere as a flat plane without distortion.\n2. Map projections can be misleading or helpful depending on their purpose.\n3. The Mercator projection was designed for navigation and preserves direction, but distorts size.\n4. The Gall-Peters projection is used to accurately display size, but distorts shape.\n5. Cartographers and mathematicians have created a variety of projections, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. Using the Mercator projection for navigation, as it preserves direction and shape.\n2. Using the Gall-Peters projection for displaying size comparisons between countries.\n3. Choosing a map projection for a specific purpose, such as navigation or display.\n4. Using GPS technology for navigation instead of paper maps.\n5. Creating a map that balances size and shape accuracy for a specific purpose.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. Comparing the strengths and weaknesses of different map projections.\n2. Analyzing the trade-offs between shape, size, direction, and land area in map projections.\n3. Understanding the historical context of map making and the impact of technology on the field.\n4. Evaluating the impact of map projections on our perception of the world.\n5. Recognizing the limitations and biases of different map projections.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. Combining different map projections to create a new projection that balances size and shape accuracy.\n2. Developing a new map projection that addresses the limitations of existing projections.\n3. Creating a map that incorporates multiple projections for different purposes.\n4. Using map projections to visualize and analyze complex data.\n5. Developing a framework for evaluating and choosing map projections for specific purposes.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. Critiquing the Mercator projection for its distortion of size and perpetuation of imperialist attitudes.\n2. Evaluating the effectiveness of different map projections for specific purposes.\n3. Justifying the use of a particular map projection for a specific purpose.\n4. Assessing the impact of map projections on our understanding of the world.\n5. Arguing for the importance of using multiple map projections to gain a more accurate understanding of the world."
