    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many symbols are used in the modern numbering system?\n    - A: 8\n    - B: 10\n    - C: 12\n    - D: 16\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the base used by computers to represent numbers?\n    - A: 8\n    - B: 10\n    - C: 12\n    - D: 2\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is the main idea behind counting up to 12 on one hand using finger sections?\n    - A: To use each finger as a single unit\n    - B: To divide each finger into multiple sections\n    - C: To use the other hand to keep track of groups\n    - D: To count only up to 10\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What concept allows for different magnitudes of value in a counting system?\n    - A: Positional notation\n    - B: Binary\n    - C: Decimal\n    - D: Algebra\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) A shopkeeper needs to count 18 items quickly using only their hands. Which method would be most efficient?\n    - A: Using finger sections to count up to 12 and then using the other hand\n    - B: Counting each item individually\n    - C: Using one hand to count up to 12 and the other hand to count up to 6\n    - D: Estimating the number of items\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is the binary representation of the decimal number 25?\n    - A: 10101\n    - B: 11001\n    - C: 11111\n    - D: 10011\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is a key difference between the decimal and binary counting systems?\n    - A: The number of symbols used\n    - B: The base used\n    - C: The concept of positional notation\n    - D: The use of finger sections\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a limitation of using finger sections to count?\n    - A: It is too slow\n    - B: It is too complex\n    - C: It has limited precision\n    - D: It is not versatile\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the maximum number that can be counted using finger sections and positional notation with two hands?\n    - A: 100\n    - B: 144\n    - C: 576\n    - D: 1023\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is the base used in the counting system that uses finger sections to count up to 12 on one hand?\n    - A: 2\n    - B: 3\n    - C: 10\n    - D: 12\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) How many states can each finger have in the binary counting system?\n    - A: 2\n    - B: 3\n    - C: 4\n    - D: 5\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is the maximum number that can be counted using the binary counting system with two hands?\n    - A: 100\n    - B: 1023\n    - C: 2048\n    - D: 4096\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) What is the concept that allows for different magnitudes of value in the binary counting system?\n    - A: Positional notation\n    - B: Decimal\n    - C: Algebra\n    - D: Geometry\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n14) Why is the binary counting system commonly used in computer programming and coding?\n    - A: It is more complex\n    - B: It is less efficient\n    - C: It allows for precise calculations using only two states (0 and 1)\n    - D: It is more user-friendly\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 7, 16, and redundant questions to ensure the set is concise and accurate. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and concision. No more refinement needed."
