Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the estimated ratio of people to cars on Earth?\n    - A: 1:1\n    - B: 1:3\n    - C: 1:6\n    - D: 1:10\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) According to the episode, how many collective years did American drivers waste in traffic last year?\n    - A: 500,000 years\n    - B: 750,000 years\n    - C: 1 million years\n    - D: 2 million years\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why are ants' traffic systems more efficient than human traffic systems?\n    - A: Ants have more advanced technology\n    - B: Ants prioritize individual interests over the collective good\n    - C: Ants have a complex social structure\n    - D: Ants have a simpler, genetically programmed approach to traffic\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What is the concept of \"unfair waits\" in the context of traffic delays?\n    - A: Waits that are longer than expected\n    - B: Waits that are perceived as unfair due to individual circumstances\n    - C: Waits caused by accidents or road closures\n    - D: Waits that occur during rush hour\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can the principles of ant traffic systems be applied to human traffic management?\n    - A: By using separate lanes for different types of traffic\n    - B: By prioritizing individual interests over the collective good\n    - C: By implementing a more cooperative approach to traffic flow\n    - D: By increasing the speed limit\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What strategy can be implemented to reduce anxiety and perceived wait times in traffic?\n    - A: Providing information signs or entertainment options\n    - B: Increasing the speed limit\n    - C: Reducing the number of traffic lights\n    - D: Encouraging aggressive driving\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is a key difference between human and ant traffic systems?\n    - A: Ants have more advanced technology\n    - B: Ants prioritize individual interests over the collective good\n    - C: Ants use pheromones to communicate, while humans use visual signals\n    - D: Ants have a more cooperative approach to traffic flow\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is a potential benefit of late merging in traffic?\n    - A: Increased congestion\n    - B: Reduced efficiency\n    - C: Increased anxiety\n    - D: Reduced congestion and increased efficiency\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) How can insights from ant traffic systems and human psychology be combined to improve traffic flow?\n    - A: By prioritizing individual interests over the collective good\n    - B: By using separate lanes for different types of traffic and providing information signs or entertainment options\n    - C: By implementing a more cooperative approach to traffic flow and using technology to optimize traffic systems\n    - D: By encouraging aggressive driving\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a potential benefit of integrating technology, such as self-driving cars, with cooperative behavior among drivers?\n    - A: Increased congestion\n    - B: Reduced efficiency\n    - C: Increased anxiety\n    - D: Improved traffic flow and reduced congestion\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is a key consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of different traffic management strategies?\n    - A: The impact on individual drivers\n    - B: The impact on the collective good\n    - C: The cost of implementation\n    - D: The level of technological advancement\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a potential drawback of emerging technologies, such as self-driving cars, on traffic management and congestion?\n    - A: Increased efficiency\n    - B: Reduced congestion\n    - C: Increased reliance on technology\n    - D: Job loss for human drivers\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo significant changes were made, but minor adjustments were made to improve clarity and concision. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
