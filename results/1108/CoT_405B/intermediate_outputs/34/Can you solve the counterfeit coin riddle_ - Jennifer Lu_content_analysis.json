The counterfeit coin is either slightly lighter or heavier than the rest.\n3. The mathematician has a balance scale and a marker to solve the problem.\n4. The mathematician can only use the scale three times to identify the counterfeit coin.\n5. The 12 coins are initially divided into three equal piles of four.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The mathematician must use a strategic approach to identify the counterfeit coin, as they cannot weigh each coin individually.\n2. The balance scale can be used to compare the weights of multiple coins at once.\n3. The marker is used to keep track of the results and mark the coins as authentic or potentially counterfeit.\n4. The problem requires the mathematician to think logically and make deductions based on the results of each weighing.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. This problem-solving approach can be applied to real-world scenarios where limited resources (e.g., the balance scale) must be used to identify a single anomaly (e.g., the counterfeit coin) among a group of similar items.\n2. The strategic thinking and logical deductions required to solve this problem can be applied to other areas of mathematics, science, and engineering.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between the weights of the coins and the results of the weighings is crucial to solving the problem.\n2. The mathematician must analyze the results of each weighing to determine the next step and eliminate possibilities.\n3. The use of the marker to keep track of the results and mark the coins is a key aspect of the problem-solving approach.\n4. The problem requires the mathematician to consider multiple possibilities and outcomes, and to use logical deductions to narrow down the options.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The mathematician combines the results of each weighing with logical deductions to form a new understanding of the problem and identify the counterfeit coin.\n2. The use of the marker to keep track of the results and mark the coins allows the mathematician to synthesize the information and make connections between the different weighings.\n3. The problem-solving approach requires the mathematician to think creatively and combine different pieces of information to form a solution.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The mathematician must evaluate the results of each weighing and determine the next step based on the outcome.\n2. The use of the marker to mark the coins as authentic or potentially counterfeit requires the mathematician to evaluate the results and make judgments about the coins.\n3. The final solution requires the mathematician to evaluate the evidence and make a conclusion about the identity of the counterfeit coin.\n4. The emperor's approval or disapproval of the mathematician's solution can be seen as an evaluation of the mathematician's problem-solving approach."
