    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How long have humans been studying astronomy?\n    - A: Since the invention of the telescope\n    - B: For as long as they have looked up at the night sky\n    - C: Since the discovery of exoplanets\n    - D: For the past century\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the estimated surface temperature of Kepler-78b?\n    - A: 1,000 Kelvin\n    - B: 2,000 Kelvin\n    - C: 3,100 Kelvin\n    - D: 4,000 Kelvin\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What makes the three exoplanets mentioned in the transcript unusual?\n    - A: They are similar in size to Earth\n    - B: They do not fit current theories of planetary formation\n    - C: They are all gas giants\n    - D: They are all located in the same galaxy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is Kepler-10c considered due to its large mass and small size?\n    - A: A mini-Earth\n    - B: A mega-Earth\n    - C: A gas giant\n    - D: A dwarf planet\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What can studying exoplanets like Kepler-78b and Kepler-10c provide insights into?\n    - A: The formation and evolution of gas giants\n    - B: The potential for life on other planets and the conditions necessary for life to arise\n    - C: The composition of the Sun\n    - D: The size of the universe\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to include \"and the conditions necessary for life to arise\" to make the correct answer more specific.\n\n6) How can understanding the unusual characteristics of these exoplanets help scientists?\n    - A: By confirming their current theories of planetary formation\n    - B: By refining their theories of planetary formation\n    - C: By discovering new planets\n    - D: By studying the Sun\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What does the close orbit of Kepler-78b to its star suggest?\n    - A: That the planet formed in its current location\n    - B: That the planet may have formed farther away and migrated closer\n    - C: That the planet is a gas giant\n    - D: That the planet is similar to Earth\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is puzzling about Kepler-10c?\n    - A: Its small size\n    - B: Its large mass\n    - C: Its lack of a thick atmosphere despite its large mass\n    - D: Its close orbit to its star\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What does the discovery of these unusual exoplanets suggest?\n    - A: That current theories of planetary formation are correct\n    - B: That there may be other factors at play in planetary formation that are not yet understood\n    - C: That the universe is smaller than thought\n    - D: That there is no potential for life on other planets\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What can the study of exoplanets like Kepler-78b, Kepler-10c, and HD 106906 b provide insights into?\n    - A: The formation and evolution of the Sun\n    - B: The potential for life on other planets and the formation and evolution of planetary systems\n    - C: The size of the universe\n    - D: The composition of gas giants\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What should scientists do in light of the discovery of these unusual exoplanets?\n    - A: Confirm their current theories of planetary formation\n    - B: Re-evaluate their current theories of planetary formation\n    - C: Stop studying exoplanets\n    - D: Focus on studying the Sun\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What does the discovery of exoplanets like Kepler-78b and Kepler-10c raise questions about?\n    - A: The size of the universe\n    - B: The composition of gas giants\n    - C: The potential for life on other planets and the conditions necessary for life to arise\n    - D: The formation and evolution of the Sun\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nAdditional questions:\n\n13) How long does a year last on Kepler-78b?\n    - A: 365 days\n    - B: 8.5 hours\n    - C: 100 days\n    - D: 1,000 years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n14) What is the estimated mass of Kepler-10c?\n    - A: 1-2 times the mass of Earth\n    - B: 5-10 times the mass of Earth\n    - C: 14-17 times the mass of Earth\n    - D: 20-30 times the mass of Earth\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n15) What is unusual about the orbit of HD 106906 b?\n    - A: It is very close to its star\n    - B: It is very far from its star\n    - C: It is a highly eccentric orbit\n    - D: It is a perfectly circular orbit\n[Correct answer]: B"
