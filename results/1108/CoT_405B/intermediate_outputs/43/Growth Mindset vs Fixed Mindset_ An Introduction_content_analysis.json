Knowledge**:\n- People with a growth mindset believe that intelligence can be developed.\n- People with a fixed mindset believe that intelligence is a fixed trait.\n- Students with a growth mindset approach school differently than students with a fixed mindset.\n- Students with a growth mindset view effort positively, while students with a fixed mindset view effort negatively.\n- Students with a growth mindset do better in school.\n\n**2. Comprehension**:\n- The concept of intelligence is viewed differently by people with growth and fixed mindsets (as a muscle vs. eye color).\n- Students with a growth mindset have the goal of learning, while students with a fixed mindset aim to show how smart they are or hide how unintelligent they are.\n- The way students with growth and fixed mindsets approach challenges and setbacks differs (persistence vs. giving up).\n\n**3. Application**:\n- Real-world scenario: A student is struggling with a difficult math problem. A student with a growth mindset would ask questions and persist, while a student with a fixed mindset might give up or avoid asking for help.\n- Teachers can use the concept of growth and fixed mindsets to inform their teaching strategies and encourage students to adopt a growth mindset.\n- Parents can apply the concept of growth and fixed mindsets to their parenting style, praising effort rather than just intelligence.\n\n**4. Analysis**:\n- Relationship between mindset and academic performance: Students with a growth mindset tend to do better in school.\n- Contrast between growth and fixed mindsets: Students with a growth mindset view challenges as opportunities for growth, while students with a fixed mindset view challenges as threats to their ego.\n- Cause-and-effect connection: The more students disagree with statements that reflect a fixed mindset, the more they have a growth mindset and the better they do in school.\n\n**5. Synthesis**:\n- Combining the concept of growth and fixed mindsets with other educational theories, such as self-efficacy and self-regulated learning, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of student motivation and achievement.\n- Integrating growth mindset principles into educational policies and practices could lead to improved academic outcomes and a more supportive learning environment.\n\n**6. Evaluation**:\n- Critique the statement \"You can learn new things, but you can't really change your basic intelligence\" and justify why it reflects a fixed mindset.\n- Evaluate the implications of having a growth or fixed mindset on students' academic performance and overall well-being.\n- Justify the importance of promoting a growth mindset in educational settings, considering the potential benefits for students' motivation, engagement, and achievement."
