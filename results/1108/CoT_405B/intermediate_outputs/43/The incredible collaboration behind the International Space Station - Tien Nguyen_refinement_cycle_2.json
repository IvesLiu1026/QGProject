    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the estimated cost of the International Space Station (ISS)?\n    - A: 50 billion U.S. dollars\n    - B: 100 billion U.S. dollars\n    - C: 150 billion U.S. dollars\n    - D: 200 billion U.S. dollars\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many nations signed the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement?\n    - A: 10 nations\n    - B: 12 nations\n    - C: 14 nations\n    - D: 16 nations\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) Why was the ISS assembled in space?\n    - A: Due to its complex design\n    - B: Due to its large size, which made it impossible to launch into orbit with a single rocket\n    - C: Due to the need for international collaboration\n    - D: Due to the lack of funding for a larger rocket\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is one of the primary functions of the ISS?\n    - A: To conduct military operations\n    - B: To serve as a research station, with astronauts conducting experiments in microgravity\n    - C: To provide a platform for space tourism\n    - D: To develop new technologies for Earth-based applications\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can the ISS be used to inform future space travel?\n    - A: By studying the long-term physical and psychological effects of being in space\n    - B: By conducting scientific experiments in microgravity\n    - C: By testing new space technologies and equipment\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What is one potential benefit of using the ISS as a model for international collaboration?\n    - A: Reduced costs for individual nations\n    - B: Increased competition among nations\n    - C: Improved communication and cooperation among nations\n    - D: Decreased scientific discovery\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is one way in which the ISS has demonstrated the importance of international cooperation?\n    - A: By showing that a single nation can achieve ambitious goals alone\n    - B: By highlighting the challenges and setbacks of international collaboration\n    - C: By demonstrating that nations can work together to achieve a common goal\n    - D: By reducing the role of national interests and politics in space exploration\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is one of the ways in which the ISS has enabled scientists to conduct research?\n    - A: By providing a platform for conducting experiments in microgravity\n    - B: By reducing the need for international collaboration\n    - C: By increasing the costs of space exploration\n    - D: By decreasing the importance of space research\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) How can the ISS be seen as a stepping stone for future space exploration?\n    - A: By providing a platform for testing new technologies and conducting scientific research\n    - B: By reducing the need for international collaboration\n    - C: By increasing the costs of space exploration\n    - D: By decreasing the importance of space research\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is one way in which the ISS can be used to develop new strategies for long-term space travel?\n    - A: By studying the effects of space travel on the human body\n    - B: By reducing the need for sustainable life support systems\n    - C: By increasing the risks and benefits of space exploration\n    - D: By decreasing the importance of radiation protection\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is one potential critique of the ISS program?\n    - A: The program has been too successful and has achieved too many discoveries\n    - B: The program has been too expensive and has not achieved enough discoveries\n    - C: The program has been too focused on international cooperation and has neglected national interests\n    - D: The program has been too focused on scientific research and has neglected other areas of space exploration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is one potential justification for the cost of the ISS program?\n    - A: The program has achieved significant scientific discoveries and has improved our understanding of space\n    - B: The program has reduced the costs of space exploration and has made it more accessible\n    - C: The program has increased the risks and benefits of space exploration\n    - D: The program has decreased the importance of space research\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-12. However, I would recommend adding more questions to cover other key concepts in the transcript, such as the ISS's size, weight, and orbit, as well as its modules and components.\n\nHere are some additional questions:\n\n13) What is the approximate size of the International Space Station?\n    - A: The size of a small car\n    - B: The size of a six-bedroom house\n    - C: The size of a football field\n    - D: The size of a city block\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n14) How much does the International Space Station weigh?\n    - A: More than 100 cars\n    - B: More than 200 cars\n    - C: More than 320 cars\n    - D: More than 400 cars\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n15) How often does the International Space Station orbit the Earth?\n    - A: Once every 24 hours\n    - B: Once every 90 minutes\n    - C: Once every 60 minutes\n    - D: Once every 30 minutes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n16) What is the name of the first module of the International Space Station?\n    - A: Zarya\n    - B: Unity\n    - C: Zvezda\n    - D: Destiny\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n17) What is the primary function of the Canadarm2 robotic arm?\n    - A: To conduct scientific experiments\n    - B: To unload new arrivals from shuttles\n    - C: To perform spacewalks\n    - D: To maintain the station's life support systems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n18) What is the name of the main airlock for strolls outside the International Space Station?\n    - A: Quest\n    - B: Pirs\n    - C: Unity\n    - D: Destiny\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n19) What is the name of the observation cupola on the International Space Station?\n    - A: Cupola\n    - B: Observatory\n    - C: Viewing Deck\n    - D: Not mentioned in the transcript\n[Correct answer]: A (Note: The transcript does not explicitly mention the name of the observation cupola, but it is commonly known as Cupola.)\n\n20) How many people have spent an average of six months on board the International Space Station?\n    - A: More than 100 visitors\n    - B: More than 200 visitors\n    - C: More than 300 visitors\n    - D: More than 400 visitors\n[Correct answer]: B"
