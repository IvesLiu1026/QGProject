    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many base pairs long is the human genome?\n    - A: 2.5 billion\n    - B: 3.2 billion\n    - C: 4.5 billion\n    - D: 5.5 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many international research centers collaborated on the Human Genome Project?\n    - A: 10\n    - B: 15\n    - C: 20\n    - D: 25\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What was the primary goal of the Human Genome Project?\n    - A: To develop new treatments for diseases\n    - B: To decipher the genetic instructions in the human body\n    - C: To improve our understanding of human genetics\n    - D: To develop personalized medicine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What was unique about the Human Genome Project's approach to data sharing?\n    - A: They shared data privately among researchers\n    - B: They shared data publicly after a year of collection\n    - C: They shared data publicly within 24 hours of collection\n    - D: They did not share data at all\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What are some potential applications of the Human Genome Project's findings in the field of medicine?\n    - A: Developing new treatments for diseases\n    - B: Improving our understanding of human genetics\n    - C: Developing personalized medicine\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What is a potential benefit of the Human Genome Project's approach to collaboration and data sharing?\n    - A: Accelerating discovery in other scientific research projects\n    - B: Slowing down discovery in other scientific research projects\n    - C: Improving data sharing in private companies\n    - D: Reducing collaboration in other scientific research projects\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What was a key difference between the Human Genome Project's approach and Celera's approach to sequencing the human genome?\n    - A: The Human Genome Project was faster and riskier, while Celera's approach was more cautious and time-consuming\n    - B: The Human Genome Project was more cautious and time-consuming, while Celera's approach was faster but riskier\n    - C: The Human Genome Project was more expensive, while Celera's approach was less expensive\n    - D: The Human Genome Project was less collaborative, while Celera's approach was more collaborative\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What do the Human Genome Project's findings highlight about the human genome?\n    - A: Its simplicity and ease of understanding\n    - B: Its complexity and the need for further research\n    - C: Its similarity to other genomes\n    - D: Its dissimilarity to other genomes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can the Human Genome Project's approach be combined with other genome sequencing approaches?\n    - A: By using a single approach for all genome sequencing projects\n    - B: By developing new methods that combine different approaches\n    - C: By abandoning the Human Genome Project's approach altogether\n    - D: By using the Human Genome Project's approach for all genome sequencing projects\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What are some potential outcomes of combining the Human Genome Project's findings with other research?\n    - A: Developing new treatments for diseases\n    - B: Improving our understanding of human genetics\n    - C: Developing personalized medicine\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What was the outcome of the competition between the Human Genome Project and Celera?\n    - A: The Human Genome Project completed the sequence first\n    - B: Celera completed the sequence first\n    - C: Both groups completed the sequence simultaneously\n    - D: Neither group completed the sequence\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential concern about the Human Genome Project's approach to data sharing?\n    - A: Private companies may profit from publicly shared data\n    - B: Researchers may be scooped by others\n    - C: The public may be misled by incomplete or inaccurate data\n    - D: The project's findings may be used for nefarious purposes\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI made minor changes to questions 1-4, 6, 8, and 12 to improve clarity and concision. I revised questions 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11 to better align with the key concepts and make the distractors more plausible but incorrect. I also rephrased question 11 to focus on the outcome of the competition rather than which approach was more effective."
