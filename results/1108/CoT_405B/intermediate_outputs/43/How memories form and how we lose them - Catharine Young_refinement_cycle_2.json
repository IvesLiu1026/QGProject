    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary mechanism by which neurons communicate at synapses?\n    - A: Electrical impulses\n    - B: Neurotransmitters\n    - C: Hormones\n    - D: Glial cells\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of neurons does the hippocampus lose every decade?\n    - A: 2%\n    - B: 5%\n    - C: 10%\n    - D: 15%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) How does age affect memory-making abilities?\n    - A: Enhances memory retrieval and formation\n    - B: Has no significant impact on memory\n    - C: Declines memory retrieval and formation\n    - D: Increases the risk of memory-related diseases\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What lifestyle choices can help preserve memories, according to research?\n    - A: Social isolation and a sedentary lifestyle\n    - B: Physical activity, a healthy diet, and mental stimulation\n    - C: Chronic stress and depression management\n    - D: Cognitive training programs only\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can individuals mitigate the negative effects of chronic stress on memory?\n    - A: Engage in more stressful activities to build resilience\n    - B: Manage chronic stress through relaxation techniques and lifestyle changes\n    - C: Ignore the impact of chronic stress on memory\n    - D: Focus solely on physical activity and diet\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What lifestyle choices can older adults make to support their brain health?\n    - A: Physical activity and social isolation\n    - B: Physical activity, a healthy diet, and mental stimulation\n    - C: Cognitive training programs only\n    - D: Ignoring the impact of age on memory\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between chronic stress and depression in terms of their impact on memory decline?\n    - A: They have a neutral effect on memory decline\n    - B: They have a compounding effect on memory decline\n    - C: They have a negligible impact on memory decline\n    - D: They only affect memory decline separately\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a crucial factor for preserving memories, according to research?\n    - A: Neuroplasticity\n    - B: Cognitive training programs\n    - C: Physical activity and diet\n    - D: Social interaction\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What can be created by combining knowledge of memory formation with an understanding of age-related decline?\n    - A: A comprehensive approach to supporting physical health\n    - B: A targeted intervention for improving memory\n    - C: A new cognitive training program\n    - D: A holistic approach to supporting mental health\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can be developed by recognizing the interconnections between chronic stress, depression, and memory decline?\n    - A: More effective strategies for mitigating these effects\n    - B: New cognitive training programs\n    - C: A comprehensive approach to supporting physical health\n    - D: A holistic approach to supporting mental health\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of different strategies for improving memory?\n    - A: Only the cost of the strategies\n    - B: Only the short-term benefits of the strategies\n    - C: The long-term benefits, limitations, and potential risks of the strategies\n    - D: Only the opinions of experts in the field\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What should be taken into account when justifying the importance of social interaction and mental stimulation for preserving memories?\n    - A: Only the physical health benefits\n    - B: Only the mental health benefits\n    - C: The complex relationships between physical and mental health\n    - D: Only the opinions of experts in the field\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n13) What happens to the efficiency of communication between neurons when they communicate repeatedly?\n    - A: It decreases\n    - B: It remains the same\n    - C: It increases\n    - D: It becomes unpredictable\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n14) What is the primary effect of depression on memory?\n    - A: Improved memory retrieval and formation\n    - B: No significant impact on memory\n    - C: Decline in memory retrieval and formation\n    - D: Increased risk of memory-related diseases\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n15) What is the name of the process by which memories are stored long-term?\n    - A: Long-term potentiation\n    - B: Neuroplasticity\n    - C: Synaptic pruning\n    - D: Neurogenesis\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
