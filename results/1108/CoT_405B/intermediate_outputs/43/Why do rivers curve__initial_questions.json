What is likely to happen to the river's course over time?\n    - A: The river will become straighter and more stable\n    - B: The river will continue to meander and change its course\n    - C: The river will become narrower and more turbulent\n    - D: The river will dry up completely\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a potential consequence of dredging a meandering river?\n    - A: The river will become more stable and less prone to flooding\n    - B: The river will change its course more rapidly\n    - C: The river will become more attractive to aquatic life\n    - D: The river will have no changes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and contrasts)**\n\n1) What is a key difference between meandering rivers and whitewater streams?\n    - A: Meandering rivers are faster-moving and more turbulent\n    - B: Meandering rivers are typically found in mountainous regions\n    - C: Meandering rivers have a more stable and less changing course\n    - D: Meandering rivers are typically found on the plains and have a more winding course\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection between natural disturbances, erosion, and the formation of bends in a river?\n    - A: Natural disturbances cause erosion, which leads to the formation of bends\n    - B: Erosion causes natural disturbances, which lead to the formation of bends\n    - C: The formation of bends causes natural disturbances and erosion\n    - D: There is no connection between natural disturbances, erosion, and the formation of bends\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How might climate change affect the formation of oxbow lakes?\n    - A: Climate change will lead to an increase in the formation of oxbow lakes\n    - B: Climate change will lead to a decrease in the formation of oxbow lakes\n    - C: Climate change will have no impact on the formation of oxbow lakes\n    - D: The impact of climate change on oxbow lakes is unknown\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) How might the principles of meandering rivers be applied to understanding ocean currents?\n    - A: By studying the similarities between the flow of rivers and ocean currents\n    - B: By studying the differences between the flow of rivers and ocean currents\n    - C: By applying the principles of river erosion to ocean currents\n    - D: By ignoring the principles of meandering rivers when studying ocean currents\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n1) What is the primary reason why preserving meandering rivers and oxbow lakes is important?\n    - A: For their aesthetic value\n    - B: For their recreational value\n    - C: For their ecological and environmental importance\n    - D: For their economic value\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a potential critique of the methods used to study and predict the behavior of meandering rivers?\n    - A: They are too complex and difficult to understand\n    - B: They are too simplistic and do not account for all variables\n    - C: They are too expensive and time-consuming\n    - D: They are too accurate and reliable\n[Correct answer]: B"
