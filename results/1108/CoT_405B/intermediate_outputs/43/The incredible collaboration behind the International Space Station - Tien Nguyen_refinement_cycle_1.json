    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the estimated cost of the International Space Station (ISS)?\n    - A: 50 billion U.S. dollars\n    - B: 100 billion U.S. dollars\n    - C: 150 billion U.S. dollars\n    - D: 200 billion U.S. dollars\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many nations signed the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement?\n    - A: 10 nations\n    - B: 12 nations\n    - C: 14 nations\n    - D: 16 nations\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) Why was the ISS assembled in space?\n    - A: Due to its complex design\n    - B: Due to its large size, which made it impossible to launch into orbit with a single rocket\n    - C: Due to the need for international collaboration\n    - D: Due to the lack of funding for a larger rocket\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is one of the primary functions of the ISS?\n    - A: To conduct military operations\n    - B: To serve as a research station, with astronauts conducting experiments in microgravity\n    - C: To provide a platform for space tourism\n    - D: To develop new technologies for Earth-based applications\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can the ISS be used to inform future space travel?\n    - A: By studying the long-term physical and psychological effects of being in space\n    - B: By conducting scientific experiments in microgravity\n    - C: By testing new space technologies and equipment\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What is one potential benefit of using the ISS as a model for international collaboration?\n    - A: Reduced costs for individual nations\n    - B: Increased competition among nations\n    - C: Improved communication and cooperation among nations\n    - D: Decreased scientific discovery\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is one way in which the ISS has demonstrated the importance of international cooperation?\n    - A: By showing that a single nation can achieve ambitious goals alone\n    - B: By highlighting the challenges and setbacks of international collaboration\n    - C: By demonstrating that nations can work together to achieve a common goal\n    - D: By reducing the role of national interests and politics in space exploration\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is one of the ways in which the ISS has enabled scientists to conduct research?\n    - A: By providing a platform for conducting experiments in microgravity\n    - B: By reducing the need for international collaboration\n    - C: By increasing the costs of space exploration\n    - D: By decreasing the importance of space research\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) How can the ISS be seen as a stepping stone for future space exploration?\n    - A: By providing a platform for testing new technologies and conducting scientific research\n    - B: By reducing the need for international collaboration\n    - C: By increasing the costs of space exploration\n    - D: By decreasing the importance of space research\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is one way in which the ISS can be used to develop new strategies for long-term space travel?\n    - A: By studying the effects of space travel on the human body\n    - B: By reducing the need for sustainable life support systems\n    - C: By increasing the risks and benefits of space exploration\n    - D: By decreasing the importance of radiation protection\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is one potential critique of the ISS program?\n    - A: The program has been too successful and has achieved too many discoveries\n    - B: The program has been too expensive and has not achieved enough discoveries\n    - C: The program has been too focused on international cooperation and has neglected national interests\n    - D: The program has been too focused on scientific research and has neglected other areas of space exploration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is one potential justification for the cost of the ISS program?\n    - A: The program has achieved significant scientific discoveries and has improved our understanding of space\n    - B: The program has reduced the costs of space exploration and has made it more accessible\n    - C: The program has increased the risks and benefits of space exploration\n    - D: The program has decreased the importance of space research\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and conciseness. I also ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. No significant changes were necessary, as the initial questions effectively covered the key concepts in the transcript."
