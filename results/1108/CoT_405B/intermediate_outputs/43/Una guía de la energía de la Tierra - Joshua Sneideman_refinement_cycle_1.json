Consider revising the question to \"What are the primary causes of global warming?\" and making it a multi-select question.)\n\n2) Which of the following is a renewable source of energy?\n    - A: Coal\n    - B: Natural Gas\n    - C: Solar Power\n    - D: Geothermal energy\n[Correct answer]: C (or D, as both are renewable sources of energy)\n\n3) What is the main purpose of reducing carbon emissions?\n    - A: To decrease air pollution and improve public health\n    - B: To increase energy efficiency and reduce costs\n    - C: To slow down global warming and mitigate climate change\n    - D: To promote sustainable development and economic growth\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) How does deforestation affect the environment?\n    - A: It increases oxygen levels and promotes biodiversity\n    - B: It decreases greenhouse gas emissions and supports climate change mitigation\n    - C: It disrupts ecosystems, reduces biodiversity, and contributes to climate change\n    - D: It prevents soil erosion and supports sustainable agriculture\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A company wants to reduce its carbon footprint. What can it do?\n    - A: Increase energy consumption and invest in non-renewable energy sources\n    - B: Implement energy-efficient practices and invest in renewable energy sources\n    - C: Reduce recycling efforts and increase waste generation\n    - D: Implement sustainable supply chain management and reduce business travel\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can an individual do to contribute to environmental conservation?\n    - A: Use public transport, carpool, or drive electric vehicles\n    - B: Increase water waste and energy consumption\n    - C: Reduce recycling efforts and increase single-use plastics\n    - D: Use non-biodegradable products and support unsustainable agriculture\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between climate change and sea levels?\n    - A: Climate change decreases sea levels and reduces coastal erosion\n    - B: Climate change has no effect on sea levels and coastal ecosystems\n    - C: Climate change increases sea levels, exacerbates coastal erosion, and threatens coastal communities\n    - D: Climate change stabilizes sea levels and supports coastal development\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How does pollution in oceans affect marine life?\n    - A: It increases marine biodiversity, supports fisheries, and promotes ecosystem health\n    - B: It decreases the risk of extinction, reduces marine pollution, and supports sustainable fishing\n    - C: It disrupts marine ecosystems, reduces biodiversity, and threatens human health\n    - D: It has no impact on marine life, ecosystems, or human well-being\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can governments, businesses, and individuals work together to address climate change?\n    - A: By increasing energy consumption, investing in non-renewable energy sources, and reducing recycling efforts\n    - B: By implementing sustainable practices, investing in renewable energy sources, and promoting climate change mitigation\n    - C: By reducing business travel, increasing virtual meetings, and promoting sustainable lifestyles\n    - D: By supporting climate change research, developing climate-resilient infrastructure, and promoting climate change adaptation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What are some potential consequences of not addressing climate change?\n    - A: Decreased risk of natural disasters, improved air and water quality, and increased economic growth\n    - B: Increased risk of natural disasters, reduced air and water quality, and decreased economic growth\n    - C: Improved public health, increased food security, and enhanced ecosystem services\n    - D: More frequent and severe weather events, increased risk of natural disasters, and exacerbated climate-related impacts\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is the most effective way to address climate change?\n    - A: Implementing a carbon tax, investing in renewable energy sources, and increasing energy efficiency\n    - B: Investing in climate change research, developing climate-resilient infrastructure, and promoting climate change adaptation\n    - C: Reducing business travel, increasing virtual meetings, and promoting sustainable lifestyles\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) How can the impact of environmental conservation efforts be measured?\n    - A: By tracking carbon emissions, monitoring changes in climate patterns, and assessing ecosystem health\n    - B: By evaluating the effectiveness of climate change policies, assessing the economic benefits of sustainability, and monitoring public perception\n    - C: By tracking changes in biodiversity, monitoring water quality, and assessing the impacts of conservation efforts on human well-being\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D"
