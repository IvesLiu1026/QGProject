    "refinement_output": "Refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary cause of global warming?\n    - A: Burning of fossil fuels\n    - B: Deforestation and land-use changes\n    - C: Pollution in oceans\n    - D: Overpopulation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness. Added \"and land-use changes\" to option B to make it more accurate.\n\n2) Which of the following gases is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect?\n    - A: Oxygen\n    - B: Methane\n    - C: Carbon dioxide\n    - D: Helium\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nReplaced option B with methane, which is also a greenhouse gas, to make it a more plausible distractor.\n\n3) What is the main consequence of rising sea levels due to climate change?\n    - A: Increased risk of droughts\n    - B: Loss of biodiversity\n    - C: Saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources\n    - D: Flooding of coastal areas\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nReplaced option C with saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources, which is a more specific consequence of rising sea levels.\n\n4) How does climate change affect global food production?\n    - A: Increased crop yields due to warmer temperatures\n    - B: Decreased crop yields due to changing weather patterns\n    - C: Shifts in growing seasons and suitable crop varieties\n    - D: Increased food production in developed countries\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nReplaced option C with shifts in growing seasons and suitable crop varieties, which is a more accurate description of the impact of climate change on food production.\n\n5) A company wants to reduce its carbon footprint by 20% in the next year. What strategy can they implement to achieve this goal?\n    - A: Increase energy efficiency through retrofitting and upgrades\n    - B: Switch to renewable energy sources\n    - C: Reduce employee salaries by 20%\n    - D: Expand operations to increase revenue\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nReplaced option A with increase energy efficiency through retrofitting and upgrades, which is another plausible strategy for reducing carbon footprint.\n\n6) A community is experiencing frequent flooding due to climate change. What adaptation strategy can they implement?\n    - A: Build a sea wall to protect against flooding\n    - B: Implement a flood-control levee system\n    - C: Develop a flood warning system\n    - D: Relocate to a higher elevation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nReplaced option B with implement a flood-control levee system, which is another plausible adaptation strategy.\n\n7) What are the potential consequences of climate change on human health?\n    - A: Increased risk of heat-related illnesses and mental health issues\n    - B: Increased risk of waterborne diseases\n    - C: Decreased risk of respiratory diseases\n    - D: Increased risk of cancer\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nReplaced option B with increased risk of waterborne diseases, which is another potential consequence of climate change on human health.\n\n8) How does climate change affect the water cycle?\n    - A: Increased precipitation in all regions\n    - B: Decreased precipitation in all regions\n    - C: Changes in precipitation patterns, leading to droughts and floods\n    - D: Increased evaporation from oceans and lakes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nReplaced option D with increased evaporation from oceans and lakes, which is a more accurate description of the impact of climate change on the water cycle.\n\n9) What combination of strategies can be implemented to mitigate the effects of climate change?\n    - A: Transition to renewable energy sources and increase energy efficiency\n    - B: Implement a carbon tax and promote sustainable land use practices\n    - C: Increase funding for climate change research and development\n    - D: Promote sustainable transportation options and reduce waste\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nReplaced option B with implement a carbon tax and promote sustainable land use practices, which is another plausible combination of strategies.\n\n10) How can climate change mitigation efforts be integrated into urban planning?\n    - A: Incorporate green spaces and renewable energy systems into building design\n    - B: Design cities with green infrastructure and climate-resilient buildings\n    - C: Implement a congestion pricing scheme\n    - D: Develop more high-rise buildings\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nReplaced option B with design cities with green infrastructure and climate-resilient buildings, which is another plausible way to integrate climate change mitigation efforts into urban planning.\n\n11) What is the most effective way to address climate change: mitigation or adaptation?\n    - A: Mitigation is more effective because it addresses the root cause of climate change\n    - B: Adaptation is more effective because it addresses the immediate impacts of climate change\n    - C: Both mitigation and adaptation are necessary and complementary approaches\n    - D: Neither mitigation nor adaptation is effective\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nReplaced option C with both mitigation and adaptation are necessary and complementary approaches, which is a more accurate description of the relationship between mitigation and adaptation.\n\n12) What is the ethical implication of climate change on future generations?\n    - A: Climate change has no impact on future generations\n    - B: Climate change will have a positive impact on future generations\n    - C: Climate change will have a negative impact on future generations, and it is our moral obligation to address it\n    - D: Climate change raises questions about intergenerational justice and equity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nReplaced option D with climate change raises questions about intergenerational justice and equity, which is another way to frame the ethical implication of climate change on future generations."
