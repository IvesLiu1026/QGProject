    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript and the initial set of questions (not provided), I will create refined questions that align with the key concepts in the transcript.\n\n1) What was the Guimaras oil spill of 2006, and what was its significance in the Philippines' history?\n    - A: It was the smallest oil spill in the Philippines' history, with only 1,000 gallons of oil spilled.\n    - B: It was the worst oil spill of its kind in the Philippines' history, with over 130,000 gallons of oil spilled.\n    - C: It was a minor oil spill that was easily contained.\n    - D: It was an oil spill that occurred in a remote area with no environmental impact.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What unconventional material was used to contain the Guimaras oil spill, and who came up with the idea?\n    - A: Synthetic materials fabricated in a lab, developed by NASA.\n    - B: Human hair, conceived by Phil McCroy, a hair stylist in Alabama.\n    - C: Oil-absorbing sponges, designed by a team of engineers.\n    - D: Chemical dispersants, created by a group of scientists.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What are the properties of human hair that make it suitable for cleaning up oil spills?\n    - A: It absorbs water and repels oil.\n    - B: It repels water and can collect contaminants, making it adsorbent.\n    - C: It is dense and heavy, allowing it to sink to the bottom of the ocean.\n    - D: It is brittle and prone to breakage, making it unsuitable for use in oil spills.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the difference between absorbent and adsorbent materials in the context of oil spills?\n    - A: Absorbent materials repel water, while adsorbent materials absorb oil.\n    - B: Absorbent materials absorb water, while adsorbent materials repel water and collect contaminants.\n    - C: Absorbent materials are natural, while adsorbent materials are synthetic.\n    - D: Absorbent materials are used for small spills, while adsorbent materials are used for large spills.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Why have hair booms and hair mats not been the primary method for cleaning major oil spills?\n    - A: They are not effective in containing oil spills.\n    - B: They are too expensive to produce and deploy.\n    - C: They have not been widely adopted or accepted as a viable solution.\n    - D: The transcript does not provide a clear reason, but it mentions that other methods, such as chemical dispersants and synthetic booms, have been used instead.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What are the potential benefits of using hair booms and hair mats for cleaning oil spills?\n    - A: They are made from synthetic materials and can be reused.\n    - B: They are natural, cheap, and renewable, making them an ideal material for cleaning up oil spills.\n    - C: They can only be used for small spills and are not effective for large-scale cleanups.\n    - D: They are too heavy and dense to be used in oil spills.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the main advantage of using hair booms and hair mats in oil spill cleanup efforts, according to the transcript?\n    - A: They can be used to clean up large oil spills quickly and effectively.\n    - B: They are a cheap and renewable resource that can be used to clean up oil spills.\n    - C: They can be used in conjunction with other methods to clean up oil spills.\n    - D: They have been widely adopted and accepted as a viable solution for oil spill cleanup.\n[Correct answer]: B"
