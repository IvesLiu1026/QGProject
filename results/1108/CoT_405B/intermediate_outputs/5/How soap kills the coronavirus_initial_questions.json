    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n1) What is effective in annihilating viruses by pulling apart their fatty layers?\n    - A: Hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol\n    - B: Soap\n    - C: Water\n    - D: Antibacterial soap\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the recommended percentage of alcohol in hand sanitizer to break down the fatty layer of viruses?\n    - A: 30%\n    - B: 40%\n    - C: 50%\n    - D: 60%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Comprehension**\n1) Why is soap necessary to dissolve viruses?\n    - A: Because viruses have a coating of proteins and fat\n    - B: Because the fatty layer of viruses makes them behave like oil in water\n    - C: Because soap has antibacterial properties\n    - D: Because hand sanitizer is not effective\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What can reduce the effectiveness of hand sanitizer?\n    - A: Washing hands for 20 seconds\n    - B: Using soap and water\n    - C: Having sweaty or dirty hands\n    - D: Using antibacterial soap\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application**\n1) When should you use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol?\n    - A: Before eating\n    - B: After using the bathroom\n    - C: When soap and water are not available\n    - D: After washing hands with soap\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What should you teach children to prevent the spread of illnesses?\n    - A: To use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol\n    - B: To wash hands with soap for 10 seconds\n    - C: To wash hands with soap for 20 seconds\n    - D: To use antibacterial soap\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the relationship between the fatty layer of viruses and their ability to stick to surfaces?\n    - A: The fatty layer makes viruses stick to surfaces, and soap breaks down this layer\n    - B: The fatty layer makes viruses repel surfaces, and soap attracts this layer\n    - C: The fatty layer has no effect on viruses' ability to stick to surfaces\n    - D: The fatty layer makes viruses stick to surfaces, and hand sanitizer breaks down this layer\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the main difference between soap and hand sanitizer in terms of effectiveness?\n    - A: Soap is more effective against bacteria, while hand sanitizer is more effective against viruses\n    - B: Soap is more effective against viruses, while hand sanitizer is more effective against bacteria\n    - C: Soap is more effective when hands are sweaty or dirty, while hand sanitizer is more effective when hands are clean\n    - D: Soap is more effective when used with water, while hand sanitizer is more effective when used alone\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) What is the importance of combining hand hygiene practices with the knowledge of soap's effectiveness against viruses?\n    - A: To promote the use of antibacterial soap\n    - B: To emphasize the importance of washing hands with soap for 10 seconds\n    - C: To prevent the spread of illnesses by using the most effective hand hygiene practices\n    - D: To reduce the use of hand sanitizer\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How do the properties of soap molecules contribute to their ability to break down the fatty layer of viruses?\n    - A: Soap molecules have one-sided molecules that attract fat\n    - B: Soap molecules have two-sided molecules that attract water and fat\n    - C: Soap molecules have antibacterial properties\n    - D: Soap molecules have antiviral properties\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) When is it justified to use soap over hand sanitizer?\n    - A: When hands are sweaty or dirty\n    - B: When soap and water are not available\n    - C: When washing hands for 10 seconds\n    - D: When possible, as recommended by the CDC\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) Why is the marketing of antibacterial soap as more effective than regular soap critiqued?\n    - A: Because antibacterial soap is more expensive\n    - B: Because antibacterial soap is not proven to be more effective\n    - C: Because antibacterial soap is more effective against viruses\n    - D: Because antibacterial soap is more effective against bacteria\n[Correct answer]: B"
