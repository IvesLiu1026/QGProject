Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary function of the brain's dopamine system?\n    - A: To regulate the body's temperature\n    - B: To convey pain messages throughout the body\n    - C: To convey pleasure messages throughout the body\n    - D: To regulate the body's metabolism\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) In the study on mice, what was the result after 10 generations?\n    - A: The running mice would run on their wheels 25% less often than the other group\n    - B: The running mice would run on their wheels 50% more often than the other group\n    - C: The running mice would run on their wheels 75% more often than the other group\n    - D: The running mice would run on their wheels 100% more often than the other group\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What are natural rewards, and how do they influence human behavior?\n    - A: Natural rewards are external motivators that influence human behavior through the serotonin system\n    - B: Natural rewards are internal motivators that influence human behavior through the dopamine system\n    - C: Natural rewards are external motivators that influence human behavior through the dopamine system\n    - D: Natural rewards are internal motivators that influence human behavior through the serotonin system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the relationship between genetics and motivation for physical activity, as demonstrated in the mouse study?\n    - A: Genetics play a minor role in motivation for physical activity\n    - B: Genetics play a significant role in motivation for physical activity\n    - C: Genetics have no impact on motivation for physical activity\n    - D: Environmental factors are the primary influence on motivation for physical activity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A fitness coach wants to design an exercise program that stimulates the dopamine system and increases motivation. What approach should they take?\n    - A: Focus on low-intensity exercises that don't challenge the individual\n    - B: Incorporate a variety of exercises that provide a sense of accomplishment and pleasure\n    - C: Emphasize the importance of external rewards, such as prizes or recognition\n    - D: Ignore the individual's genetic predisposition to physical activity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A person has a genetic predisposition to physical laziness. What strategy can they use to overcome it?\n    - A: Rely solely on willpower and self-discipline\n    - B: Develop a personalized fitness plan that takes into account their genetic predisposition\n    - C: Focus on finding external motivators, such as a workout buddy or a reward system\n    - D: Give up on physical activity altogether\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the dopamine system and motivation for physical activity, and how can this relationship be influenced by genetics?\n    - A: The dopamine system has no impact on motivation for physical activity\n    - B: Genetics play a minor role in influencing the dopamine system and motivation for physical activity\n    - C: The dopamine system plays a significant role in motivation for physical activity, and genetics can influence this relationship\n    - D: Environmental factors are the primary influence on the dopamine system and motivation for physical activity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the contrast between the brains of the running mice and those that did not run as much?\n    - A: The running mice had smaller dopamine systems and regions that deal with motivation and reward\n    - B: The running mice had larger dopamine systems and regions that deal with motivation and reward\n    - C: The running mice had the same size dopamine systems and regions that deal with motivation and reward as the other group\n    - D: The running mice had a different type of dopamine system and regions that deal with motivation and reward\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can the concepts of natural rewards, genetics, and motivation be combined to develop a comprehensive understanding of physical activity and its relationship to human behavior?\n    - A: By focusing solely on the role of genetics in physical activity\n    - B: By ignoring the impact of environmental factors on physical activity\n    - C: By integrating the knowledge of genetic predisposition to physical laziness with environmental factors and the concept of natural rewards\n    - D: By relying solely on external motivators to influence physical activity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What new approach can be developed by synthesizing the understanding of the brain's reward system with the concept of genetic addiction to physical activity?\n    - A: A focus on punishment and negative reinforcement to motivate physical activity\n    - B: A personalized approach that takes into account an individual's genetic predisposition and environmental factors\n    - C: A one-size-fits-all approach that ignores individual differences in motivation and genetics\n    - D: A reliance on external rewards and recognition to motivate physical activity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the validity of the concept of a \"couch potato gene\" and its implications for understanding physical laziness?\n    - A: The concept is entirely valid and explains all cases of physical laziness\n    - B: The concept is partially valid and explains some cases of physical laziness\n    - C: The concept is entirely invalid and has no implications for understanding physical laziness\n    - D: The concept is too simplistic and ignores the complexity of human behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors in determining an individual's level of physical activity?\n    - A: Genetics play a minor role, and environmental factors are the primary influence\n    - B: Genetics play a significant role, and environmental factors have a minor impact\n    - C: Genetics and environmental factors are equally important\n    - D: The relationship between genetics and environmental factors is too complex to determine\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
