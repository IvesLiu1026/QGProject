    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) According to the study, what percentage of meerkats lose their lives to other meerkats?\n    - A: 5%\n    - B: 10%\n    - C: 15%\n    - D: 20%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) Which of the following species is NOT among the top species for murder, according to the study?\n    - A: Lions\n    - B: Bears\n    - C: Elephants\n    - D: Wolves\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the central debate between philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau regarding human nature?\n    - A: Whether humans are naturally violent or if civilization corrupts us\n    - B: Whether humans are naturally good or if society makes us violent\n    - C: Whether humans are naturally social or if we are solitary animals\n    - D: Whether humans are naturally intelligent or if we are instinctual\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined for clarity.\n\n4) How did the rate of lethal violence in human societies change from paleolithic times to the Medieval period, according to the study?\n    - A: It increased\n    - B: It decreased\n    - C: It remained constant\n    - D: It fluctuated randomly\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined for conciseness.\n\n5) How can understanding the evolutionary roots of human violence inform strategies for reducing violence in modern societies?\n    - A: By identifying genetic markers for violence\n    - B: By developing more effective punishments for violent crimes\n    - C: By addressing the underlying social and environmental factors that contribute to violence\n    - D: By ignoring the evolutionary roots of human violence and focusing on social factors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) Which field(s) of study can benefit from the findings of the research on mammal killing behavior?\n    - A: Psychology\n    - B: Sociology\n    - C: Criminology\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What does the contrast between the rates of lethal violence in paleolithic times and the Medieval period suggest about human behavior?\n    - A: That humans are naturally violent and that society has no impact on our behavior\n    - B: That humans are naturally peaceful and that society corrupts us\n    - C: That societal changes can impact human behavior and rates of violence\n    - D: That human behavior is random and unpredictable\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What unique aspect of human violence is revealed by the distinction between infanticide and adult homicide in primates and humans?\n    - A: That humans are more violent than other primates\n    - B: That humans are less violent than other primates\n    - C: That humans kill each other as adults at a high rate, unlike many other mammals\n    - D: That humans are more likely to engage in infanticide than other primates\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What can be gained by combining the study's findings with philosophical perspectives on human nature?\n    - A: A more simplistic understanding of human violence\n    - B: A more nuanced understanding of human violence\n    - C: A more pessimistic view of human nature\n    - D: A more optimistic view of human nature\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What can be achieved by integrating insights from evolutionary biology, psychology, and sociology?\n    - A: A more comprehensive understanding of human violence\n    - B: A more narrow understanding of human violence\n    - C: A more fragmented understanding of human violence\n    - D: A more superficial understanding of human violence\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) Why is it crucial to evaluate the validity of the study's findings and methodology?\n    - A: To understand the implications of the research\n    - B: To criticize the researchers\n    - C: To ignore the findings\n    - D: To fulfill a publication requirement\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness.\n\n12) What is necessary to justify the use of evolutionary biology to inform strategies for reducing human violence?\n    - A: A superficial understanding of human behavior\n    - B: A comprehensive understanding of human behavior\n    - C: A narrow focus on genetic factors\n    - D: A broad focus on social and environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed."
