    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers.\n\n1) What was the significance of the Guimaras oil spill of 2006 in the Philippines' history?\n    - A: It was the smallest oil spill in the Philippines' history.\n    - B: It was the worst oil spill of its kind in the Philippines' history, with over 130,000 gallons of oil spilled.\n    - C: It was a minor oil spill that was easily contained.\n    - D: It was an oil spill that occurred in a remote area with no environmental impact.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Who came up with the idea of using human hair to contain oil spills, and what inspired this idea?\n    - A: Phil McCroy, a hair stylist in Alabama, who was inspired by the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the way oil affected a sea otter's fur.\n    - B: NASA scientists, who were experimenting with synthetic materials.\n    - C: A team of engineers, who were designing oil-absorbing sponges.\n    - D: A group of environmentalists, who were exploring alternative methods for cleaning up oil spills.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) What properties make human hair suitable for cleaning up oil spills?\n    - A: It absorbs water and repels oil.\n    - B: It repels water and can collect contaminants, making it adsorbent.\n    - C: It is dense and heavy, allowing it to sink to the bottom of the ocean.\n    - D: It is brittle and prone to breakage, making it unsuitable for use in oil spills.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the difference between absorbent and adsorbent materials in the context of oil spills?\n    - A: Absorbent materials repel water, while adsorbent materials absorb oil.\n    - B: Absorbent materials absorb water, while adsorbent materials repel water and collect contaminants.\n    - C: Absorbent materials are natural, while adsorbent materials are synthetic.\n    - D: Absorbent materials are used for small spills, while adsorbent materials are used for large spills.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Why have hair booms and hair mats not been the primary method for cleaning major oil spills, according to the transcript?\n    - A: They are not effective in containing oil spills.\n    - B: They are too expensive to produce and deploy.\n    - C: They have not been widely adopted or accepted as a viable solution.\n    - D: Other methods, such as chemical dispersants and synthetic booms, have been used instead, but the transcript does not provide a clear reason.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What are the potential benefits of using hair booms and hair mats for cleaning oil spills?\n    - A: They are made from synthetic materials and can be reused.\n    - B: They are natural, cheap, and renewable, making them an ideal material for cleaning up oil spills.\n    - C: They can only be used for small spills and are not effective for large-scale cleanups.\n    - D: They are too heavy and dense to be used in oil spills.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the main advantage of using hair booms and hair mats in oil spill cleanup efforts, according to the transcript?\n    - A: They can be used to clean up large oil spills quickly and effectively.\n    - B: They are a cheap and renewable resource that can be used to clean up oil spills.\n    - C: They can be used in conjunction with other methods to clean up oil spills.\n    - D: They have been widely adopted and accepted as a viable solution for oil spill cleanup.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more significant refinement needed. However, minor adjustments can be made based on specific requirements or further feedback."
