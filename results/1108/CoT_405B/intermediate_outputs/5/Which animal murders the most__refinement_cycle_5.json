    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) According to the study, what percentage of meerkats lose their lives to other meerkats?\n    - A: 10%\n    - B: 15%\n    - C: 18%\n    - D: 20%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) Which of the following species is NOT among the top species for murder, according to the study?\n    - A: Lions\n    - B: Bears\n    - C: Elephants\n    - D: Wolves\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the central debate between philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau regarding human nature?\n    - A: Whether humans are naturally violent or if civilization corrupts us\n    - B: Whether humans are shaped by nature or nurture\n    - C: Whether humans are inherently selfish or altruistic\n    - D: Whether humans are born with a fixed moral nature\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to remove duplicate question.\n\n4) How did the rate of lethal violence in human societies change from paleolithic times to the Medieval period, according to the study?\n    - A: It decreased\n    - B: It remained constant\n    - C: It increased from 3.5% to 12%\n    - D: It fluctuated randomly\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What unique aspect of human violence is revealed by the distinction between infanticide and adult homicide in primates and humans?\n    - A: That humans are more violent than other primates\n    - B: That humans are less violent than other primates\n    - C: That humans kill each other as adults at a high rate, unlike many other mammals\n    - D: That humans are more likely to engage in infanticide than other primates\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What can be gained by combining the study's findings with philosophical perspectives on human nature?\n    - A: A more simplistic understanding of human violence\n    - B: A more nuanced understanding of human violence\n    - C: A more comprehensive understanding of human behavior\n    - D: A more superficial understanding of human behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What can be achieved by integrating insights from evolutionary biology, psychology, and sociology?\n    - A: A more comprehensive understanding of human violence\n    - B: A more narrow understanding of human violence\n    - C: A more fragmented understanding of human violence\n    - D: A more interdisciplinary approach to understanding human behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) Which field(s) of study can benefit from the findings of the research on mammal killing behavior?\n    - A: Psychology\n    - B: Sociology\n    - C: Criminology\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What does the contrast between the rates of lethal violence in paleolithic times and the Medieval period suggest about human behavior?\n    - A: That humans are naturally violent and that society has no impact on our behavior\n    - B: That humans are naturally peaceful and that society corrupts us\n    - C: That societal changes can impact human behavior and rates of violence\n    - D: That human behavior is shaped by a combination of genetic and environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) Why is it crucial to evaluate the validity of the study's findings and methodology?\n    - A: To understand the implications of the research\n    - B: To critically assess the research design and methods\n    - C: To ignore the findings\n    - D: To fulfill a publication requirement\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nRemoved questions 11-17 as they were duplicates or not necessary.\n\nThe refined questions are clear, concise, and align with the key concepts in the transcript. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
