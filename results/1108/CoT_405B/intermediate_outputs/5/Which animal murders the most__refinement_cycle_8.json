Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) According to the study, what percentage of meerkats lose their lives to other meerkats?\n    - A: 15%\n    - B: 18%\n    - C: 20%\n    - D: 25%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which of the following species is NOT among the top species for murder, according to the study?\n    - A: Lions\n    - B: Bears\n    - C: Elephants\n    - D: Chimpanzees\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the central debate between philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau regarding human nature?\n    - A: Whether humans are naturally violent or if civilization corrupts us\n    - B: Whether humans are shaped by nature or nurture\n    - C: Whether humans are inherently selfish or altruistic\n    - D: Whether humans are born with a fixed moral nature\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) How did the rate of lethal violence in human societies change from paleolithic times to the Medieval period, according to the study?\n    - A: It decreased\n    - B: It remained constant\n    - C: It increased from 3.5% to 12%\n    - D: It fluctuated randomly\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What unique aspect of human violence is revealed by the distinction between infanticide and adult homicide in primates and humans?\n    - A: That humans are more violent than other primates\n    - B: That humans are less violent than other primates\n    - C: That humans kill each other as adults at a high rate, unlike many other mammals\n    - D: That humans are more likely to engage in infanticide than other primates\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What can be gained by combining the study's findings with philosophical perspectives on human nature?\n    - A: A more simplistic understanding of human violence\n    - B: A more nuanced understanding of human violence\n    - C: A more comprehensive understanding of human behavior\n    - D: A more superficial understanding of human behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) (Removed due to duplication with question 6)\n\n8) (Removed due to duplication with question 6)\n\n9) (Removed due to duplication with question 6)\n\n10) Which field(s) of study can benefit from the findings of the research on mammal killing behavior?\n    - A: Psychology\n    - B: Sociology\n    - C: Criminology\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What does the contrast between the rates of lethal violence in paleolithic times and the Medieval period suggest about human behavior?\n    - A: That humans are naturally violent and that society has no impact on our behavior\n    - B: That humans are naturally peaceful and that society corrupts us\n    - C: That societal changes can impact human behavior and rates of violence\n    - D: That human behavior is shaped by a combination of genetic and environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is it crucial to evaluate the validity of the study's findings and methodology?\n    - A: To understand the implications of the research\n    - B: To critically assess the research design and methods\n    - C: To ignore the findings\n    - D: To fulfill a publication requirement\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) (Removed due to duplication with question 12)\n\nThe refined questions aim to improve clarity and conciseness, while ensuring that the correct answers are accurate and the distractors are plausible but incorrect."
