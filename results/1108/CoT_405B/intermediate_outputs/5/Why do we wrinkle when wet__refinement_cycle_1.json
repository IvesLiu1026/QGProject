    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What happens to fingers and toes after being immersed in water for longer than 10 minutes?\n    - A: They become smoother\n    - B: They remain unchanged\n    - C: They become wrinkled\n    - D: They become numb\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What was the initial theory about the cause of wrinkled digits?\n    - A: Nervous system constricting blood vessels\n    - B: Osmosis\n    - C: Water pressure\n    - D: Skin elasticity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What did the 1935 study disprove about wrinkled digits?\n    - A: The role of skin elasticity\n    - B: The theory of osmosis\n    - C: The importance of water pressure\n    - D: The effect of nerve damage on skin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make distractors more plausible.\n\n4) What is the proposed advantage of wrinkly skin in certain environments?\n    - A: Improved vision\n    - B: Enhanced hearing\n    - C: Better grip in wet conditions\n    - D: Increased sensitivity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) A construction worker is often required to work in wet conditions.

What concept from the study of wrinkly skin could be applied to this design?\n    - A: Using smooth surfaces to reduce friction\n    - B: Creating channels to direct water away\n    - C: Increasing the material's weight to improve traction\n    - D: Using a hydrophobic coating to repel water\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make distractors more plausible.\n\n7) What is the key factor in understanding the phenomenon of wrinkled digits?\n    - A: The role of osmosis\n    - B: The relationship between the nervous system and wrinkled digits\n    - C: The effect of water pressure on skin\n    - D: The importance of skin elasticity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What does the contrast between the initial theory of osmosis and the later discovery of the nervous system's role highlight?\n    - A: The importance of relying on initial theories\n    - B: The need for continued scientific investigation\n    - C: The role of chance in scientific discovery\n    - D: The importance of considering alternative explanations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make distractors more plausible.\n\n9) What could be a potential innovation resulting from combining the ideas of wrinkly skin providing a better grip and the design of materials or surfaces that need to provide traction in wet conditions?\n    - A: A new type of waterproof coating\n    - B: A material that changes texture in response to moisture\n    - C: A surface that uses micro-ridges to improve traction\n    - D: A tool that uses increased weight to improve traction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make distractors more plausible.\n\n10) How could integrating the concept of wrinkly skin as an evolutionary adaptation with other examples of adaptations that provide advantages in specific environments contribute to our understanding of evolutionary biology?\n    - A: By highlighting the importance of genetic drift in adaptation\n    - B: By demonstrating the role of mutation in evolution\n    - C: By providing a deeper understanding of how adaptations provide advantages in specific environments\n    - D: By showing the limitations of evolutionary biology in explaining complex phenomena\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make distractors more plausible.\n\n11) What would be a potential limitation of the 2013 study on wrinkly skin providing a better grip in wet conditions?\n    - A: The study's small sample size\n    - B: The study's limited control over variables\n    - C: The study's limited generalizability to other environments\n    - D: The study's lack of consideration of alternative explanations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make distractors more plausible.\n\n12) Why is continued scientific investigation into the phenomenon of wrinkled digits important?\n    - A: Because it could lead to new innovations and a deeper understanding of evolutionary biology\n    - B: Because it is a trivial matter that warrants no further study\n    - C: Because it has no potential applications or implications\n    - D: Because it is a well-understood phenomenon that requires no further investigation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make distractors more plausible."
