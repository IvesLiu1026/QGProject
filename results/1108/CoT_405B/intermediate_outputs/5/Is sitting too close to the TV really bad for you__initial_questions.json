    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. What type of televisions were known to emit X-rays in the late 1960s?\n    - A: LCD TVs\n    - B: CRT TVs\n    - C: Plasma TVs\n    - D: OLED TVs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. What is the primary cause of X-ray generation in old CRT TVs?\n    - A: Electrons striking a screen in a vacuum\n    - B: The use of lead in the glass ray tubes\n    - C: The deflection of X-rays out of the bottom of the TV set\n    - D: The emission of radiation from the phosphors\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. Why is the idea that sitting too close to the TV hurts your eyes no longer true?\n    - A: Because old CRT TVs are still widely used\n    - B: Because modern LCD TVs emit more radiation than old CRT TVs\n    - C: Because advancements in technology have eliminated the risk of radiation exposure\n    - D: Because people are no longer concerned about eye-strain\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What is a common cause of eye-strain, regardless of the type of screen being used?\n    - A: Sitting too close to the screen\n    - B: Staring at a screen for an extended period\n    - C: Using a screen with a high refresh rate\n    - D: Adjusting the screen's brightness and contrast\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. What precaution can people take when using vintage electronics, such as old CRT TVs?\n    - A: Sit closer to the screen to reduce eye-strain\n    - B: Use a screen protector to block radiation\n    - C: Take regular breaks to reduce exposure to radiation\n    - D: Adjust the screen's brightness and contrast to reduce eye-strain\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What is a benefit of knowing that modern LCD TVs do not emit harmful radiation?\n    - A: It allows people to sit closer to the screen without worrying about eye-strain\n    - B: It eliminates the need for regular breaks when using screens\n    - C: It alleviates concerns about sitting close to the TV\n    - D: It reduces the risk of radiation exposure from other electronic devices\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. What is the relationship between the faulty GE televisions and the risk of radiation exposure?\n    - A: The faulty televisions reduced the risk of radiation exposure\n    - B: The faulty televisions had no impact on the risk of radiation exposure\n    - C: The faulty televisions increased the risk of radiation exposure\n    - D: The faulty televisions eliminated the risk of radiation exposure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What is a key difference between old CRT TVs and modern LCD TVs in terms of radiation emission?\n    - A: Old CRT TVs emit less radiation than modern LCD TVs\n    - B: Old CRT TVs emit more radiation than modern LCD TVs\n    - C: Both old CRT TVs and modern LCD TVs emit the same amount of radiation\n    - D: Neither old CRT TVs nor modern LCD TVs emit radiation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. How does understanding the historical context of the catchphrase \"don't sit too close to the TV\" relate to advancements in technology?\n    - A: It shows that the catchphrase is still relevant today\n    - B: It highlights the importance of taking breaks when using screens\n    - C: It demonstrates how technology has eliminated the risk of radiation exposure\n    - D: It reveals that the catchphrase was never based on scientific evidence\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What can be inferred about the evolution of television technology by comparing CRT TVs and LCD TVs?\n    - A: That LCD TVs are more prone to radiation emission than CRT TVs\n    - B: That CRT TVs are more energy-efficient than LCD TVs\n    - C: That LCD TVs have eliminated the risk of radiation exposure associated with CRT TVs\n    - D: That CRT TVs are more environmentally friendly than LCD TVs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. What can be said about the effectiveness of the recall notice issued for the faulty GE televisions?\n    - A: It was unnecessary because the risk of radiation exposure was low\n    - B: It was ineffective because it did not reach all affected consumers\n    - C: It was successful in preventing further radiation exposure\n    - D: It was irrelevant because the faulty televisions were no longer in use\n[Correct answer]: C (Note: This question assumes that the recall notice was successful, but the actual effectiveness of the recall notice is not provided in the content analysis.)\n\n2. What justification can be made for taking regular breaks when using screens to prevent eye-strain?\n    - A: It is unnecessary because eye-strain is not a serious health concern\n    - B: It is ineffective because breaks do not reduce eye-strain\n    - C: It is important because staring at a screen for too long can cause eye-strain and headaches\n    - D: It is irrelevant because eye-strain is only caused by sitting too close to the screen\n[Correct answer]: C"
