    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the top-selling item at Wal-mart, according to the video?\n    - A: Apples\n    - B: Bananas\n    - C: Oranges\n    - D: Grapes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Where are bananas originally from?\n    - A: Central and South America\n    - B: South and Southeast Asia\n    - C: Africa and Europe\n    - D: North America and Australia\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why are cultivated bananas considered sterile mutants?\n    - A: They are genetically modified\n    - B: They are resistant to diseases\n    - C: They lack fertile seeds\n    - D: They are grown in greenhouses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What made the Gros Michel crop vulnerable to disease?\n    - A: Its genetic diversity\n    - B: Its genetic monotony\n    - C: Its resistance to pests\n    - D: Its high yield\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can be learned from the history and genetics of bananas?\n    - A: How to grow bananas in different climates\n    - B: How to develop new, disease-resistant varieties of bananas\n    - C: How to increase the yield of banana crops\n    - D: How to reduce the nutritional value of bananas\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential consequence of relying on a single, genetically identical crop?\n    - A: Increased crop yields\n    - B: Improved disease resistance\n    - C: Reduced genetic diversity\n    - D: Increased nutritional value\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How did the genetic monotony of the Gros Michel crop affect its vulnerability to disease?\n    - A: It made it more resistant to disease\n    - B: It had no effect on its vulnerability to disease\n    - C: It made it more vulnerable to disease\n    - D: It made it less vulnerable to disease\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a key difference between wild bananas and cultivated bananas?\n    - A: Wild bananas are smaller than cultivated bananas\n    - B: Wild bananas have seeds, while cultivated bananas do not\n    - C: Wild bananas are more resistant to disease than cultivated bananas\n    - D: Wild bananas are less nutritious than cultivated bananas\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can knowledge of genetics, epidemics, fungi, and pathology be used to preserve the Cavendish variety and develop new, disease-resistant varieties of bananas?\n    - A: By creating genetically modified bananas\n    - B: By developing new pesticides\n    - C: By breeding bananas with wild relatives to increase genetic diversity\n    - D: By using lab-grown plant stock to reduce disease transmission\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What broader theme in agriculture and food security is illustrated by the story of the Gros Michel and Cavendish bananas?\n    - A: The importance of crop rotation\n    - B: The risks of relying on a single, genetically identical crop\n    - C: The benefits of genetic engineering\n    - D: The importance of reducing pesticide use\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a potential risk of relying on a single, genetically identical crop, such as the Cavendish banana?\n    - A: Increased crop yields\n    - B: Improved disease resistance\n    - C: Reduced genetic diversity\n    - D: Increased nutritional value\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential benefit of developing disease-resistant crops, such as bananas, through genetic engineering?\n    - A: Reduced genetic diversity\n    - B: Increased pesticide use\n    - C: Improved disease resistance\n    - D: Decreased crop yields\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor changes to questions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 to improve clarity and concision. I revised question 3 to make the correct answer more specific. I also revised question 9 to make the correct answer more accurate and specific to the transcript."
