    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the lowest temperature that wood frogs can survive?\n    - A: 32 degrees Fahrenheit\n    - B: 3 degrees Fahrenheit\n    - C: 0 degrees Fahrenheit\n    - D: -10 degrees Fahrenheit\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What are the primary components of the antifreeze produced by wood frogs?\n    - A: Glucose and water\n    - B: Glucose and urine\n    - C: Urine and salt\n    - D: Water and salt\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary purpose of the antifreeze produced by wood frogs?\n    - A: To regulate body temperature\n    - B: To prevent dehydration and death\n    - C: To slow down metabolic activity\n    - D: To speed up heart rate\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What unique adaptation allows wood frogs to survive the winter months?\n    - A: Hibernation\n    - B: Migration\n    - C: Producing antifreeze and entering suspended animation\n    - D: Camouflage\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What potential medical application could arise from studying the wood frog's antifreeze production?\n    - A: Developing new treatments for cancer\n    - B: Preserving organs for transplantation\n    - C: Improving vision in low-light conditions\n    - D: Enhancing athletic performance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How does the wood frog's antifreeze production help prevent cell damage during freezing temperatures?\n    - A: By reducing the amount of glucose in the blood\n    - B: By increasing the amount of salt in the blood\n    - C: By preventing the formation of ice crystals in the cells\n    - D: By reducing the amount of urine in the blood\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the wood frog's antifreeze production and its ability to survive in cold temperatures?\n    - A: The antifreeze production is unrelated to the frog's survival in cold temperatures\n    - B: The antifreeze production is a key adaptation to the frog's environment\n    - C: The antifreeze production is only necessary in warm temperatures\n    - D: The antifreeze production is only necessary in dry environments\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the wood frog's body respond to the onset of winter?\n    - A: It increases its metabolic activity\n    - B: It decreases its metabolic activity and produces antifreeze\n    - C: It migrates to a warmer location\n    - D: It hibernates without producing antifreeze\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the antifreeze production and the prevention of dehydration and death?\n    - A: The antifreeze production causes dehydration and death\n    - B: The antifreeze production prevents dehydration and death\n    - C: The antifreeze production has no effect on dehydration and death\n    - D: The antifreeze production only prevents dehydration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) How could understanding the wood frog's ability to freeze and thaw inform the development of new technologies for preserving and reviving tissues and organs?\n    - A: By developing new cooling systems\n    - B: By developing new heating systems\n    - C: By informing the development of new technologies for preserving and reviving tissues and organs\n    - D: By developing new medical imaging technologies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 11-14 as they were redundant or not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript. The refined questions are clear, concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors, ensuring that they effectively assess the understanding of the wood frog's unique adaptations and their potential applications."
