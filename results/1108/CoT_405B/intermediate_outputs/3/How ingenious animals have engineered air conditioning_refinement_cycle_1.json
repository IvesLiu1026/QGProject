Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the approximate height of the largest termite mounds, equivalent to a human-scale skyscraper of what height?\n    - A: 1 kilometer\n    - B: 2 kilometers\n    - C: 3.5 kilometers\n    - D: 5 kilometers\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which phenomenon is used by prairie dogs and ants to ventilate their underground tunnels?\n    - A: Bernoulli's principle\n    - B: The Coandă effect\n    - C: The Venturi effect\n    - D: The Magnus effect\n[Correct answer]: B (No change)\n\n3) What is the primary function of termite mounds in terms of air circulation?\n    - A: To trap heat and maintain a constant temperature\n    - B: To exchange CO2 and oxygen like a big lung\n    - C: To filter out pollutants and toxins\n    - D: To regulate humidity levels\n[Correct answer]: B (No change)\n\n4) What is the main similarity between the ventilation systems of different species, such as ants and prairie dogs?\n    - A: They all use fans to circulate air\n    - B: They all rely on the Coandă effect\n    - C: They all use complex networks of tunnels and chambers\n    - D: They all have a decentralized control system\n[Correct answer]: B (Modified option D to decentralized control system for better clarity)\n\n5) A team of engineers is designing a new ventilation system for an underground parking garage. Which natural system could they use as inspiration?\n    - A: The human respiratory system\n    - B: The termite mound ventilation system\n    - C: The water cycle\n    - D: The process of photosynthesis\n[Correct answer]: B (No change)\n\n6) What is a potential benefit of using biomimicry to develop innovative solutions for air circulation in closed spaces?\n    - A: Increased energy consumption\n    - B: Reduced construction costs\n    - C: Improved efficiency and sustainability\n    - D: Enhanced aesthetic appeal\n[Correct answer]: C (No change)\n\n7) What is a key difference between natural and human-made ventilation systems?\n    - A: Natural systems are more complex and expensive\n    - B: Human-made systems are more efficient and sustainable\n    - C: Natural systems often rely on instinct and cooperation\n    - D: Human-made systems are more adaptable to changing conditions\n[Correct answer]: C (No change)\n\n8) What is a potential application of the Coandă effect in a field other than engineering?\n    - A: Medicine\n    - B: Agriculture\n    - C: Aerospace\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D (No change)\n\n9) How could the principles of termite mounds and the Coandă effect be combined to develop a new ventilation system?\n    - A: By using fans to circulate air through a network of tunnels\n    - B: By creating a system that relies on daily temperature cycles and the Coandă effect\n    - C: By developing a centralized control system to regulate air flow\n    - D: By using a combination of natural and mechanical ventilation methods\n[Correct answer]: B (No change)\n\n10) What is a potential benefit of integrating biomimicry and engineering to create innovative solutions for air circulation in closed spaces?\n    - A: Reduced creativity and innovation\n    - B: Increased complexity and cost\n    - C: Improved efficiency and sustainability\n    - D: Enhanced collaboration and knowledge-sharing\n[Correct answer]: C (No change)\n\n11) What is a key factor to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of different ventilation systems in closed spaces?\n    - A: Aesthetic appeal\n    - B: Energy consumption\n    - C: Air quality and circulation\n    - D: Construction costs\n[Correct answer]: C (No change)\n\n12) What is a potential limitation of using biomimicry in engineering?\n    - A: Increased complexity and cost\n    - B: Reduced creativity and innovation\n    - C: Limited scalability and adaptability\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D (No change)\n\nRefined questions 1, 4, and minor adjustments to the wording of some options for better clarity. The rest of the questions remain unchanged."
