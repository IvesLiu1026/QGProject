Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How is COVID-19 primarily spread?\n    - A: Through contaminated food and water\n    - B: Through air currents carrying microscopic droplets of coronavirus\n    - C: Through direct contact with an infected person\n    - D: Through insect vectors\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What imaging technique can visualize airflow and the spread of coronavirus?\n    - A: MRI imaging\n    - B: CT scanning\n    - C: Schlieren imaging\n    - D: X-ray imaging\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) How do masks help slow airborne infection, according to the concept of schlieren imaging?\n    - A: By capturing smaller droplets and allowing larger droplets to pass through\n    - B: By capturing larger droplets and reducing the momentum of smaller droplets\n    - C: By filtering out all droplets, regardless of size\n    - D: By creating a barrier that prevents all airflow\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why is a proper mask fit essential for effectiveness?\n    - A: To filter out all droplets, regardless of size\n    - B: To capture larger droplets and reduce the momentum of smaller droplets\n    - C: To create a tight seal around the face and prevent air from escaping\n    - D: To wear the mask comfortably for extended periods\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is the primary reason for wearing a mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19?\n    - A: To protect the wearer from getting infected\n    - B: To protect others from getting infected by the wearer\n    - C: To reduce transmission through contaminated surfaces\n    - D: To reduce transmission through insect vectors\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What combination of safety measures is most effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19?\n    - A: Wearing a mask and washing hands frequently\n    - B: Wearing a mask and maintaining physical distancing\n    - C: Washing hands frequently and maintaining physical distancing\n    - D: Wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, and maintaining physical distancing\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) How do the sizes of viral particles and fabric weaves compare?\n    - A: Viral particles are larger than the weave of most fabrics\n    - B: Viral particles are smaller than the weave of most fabrics\n    - C: Viral particles are the same size as the weave of most fabrics\n    - D: The size of viral particles is irrelevant to the weave of fabrics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the primary benefit of using schlieren imaging to study COVID-19 spread?\n    - A: Visualizing coronavirus spread in real-time\n    - B: Providing a cost-effective method for testing mask effectiveness\n    - C: Studying viral particle behavior in different environments\n    - D: Understanding how masks capture larger droplets and reduce smaller droplet momentum\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) How can schlieren imaging and mask effectiveness be combined to reduce COVID-19 spread?\n    - A: Using schlieren imaging to study coronavirus spread in different environments and designing new masks based on schlieren imaging principles\n    - B: Using schlieren imaging to study coronavirus spread in different environments and implementing mask-wearing policies\n    - C: Designing new masks based on schlieren imaging principles and implementing physical distancing policies\n    - D: Using schlieren imaging to study coronavirus spread in different environments and developing new technologies to improve mask effectiveness\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is the most effective way to integrate mask-wearing with other safety measures to prevent COVID-19 spread?\n    - A: Implementing mask-wearing policies, encouraging handwashing, and physical distancing\n    - B: Designing new masks based on schlieren imaging principles and implementing physical distancing policies\n    - C: Using schlieren imaging to study coronavirus spread in different environments and developing new technologies to improve mask effectiveness\n    - D: Creating public health campaigns emphasizing mask-wearing and social distancing importance\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
