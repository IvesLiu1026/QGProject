Spending extended hours indoors can have developmental effects on children, particularly on their eye health.\n3. TV viewing can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, which is a major contributor to obesity.\n4. Engaging in mentally rigorous tasks, such as reading or playing board games, can require more energy and burn more calories.\n5.
