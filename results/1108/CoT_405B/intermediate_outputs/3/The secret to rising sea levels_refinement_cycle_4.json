    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is a primary cause of the melting of ice caps and glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica?\n    - A: Changes in ocean currents\n    - B: Increased temperatures\n    - C: Shifts in the Earth's axis\n    - D: Decreased atmospheric pressure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the approximate volume of water contained in the Earth's oceans, as mentioned in the transcript?\n    - A: 1.4 million cubic km\n    - B: 1.4 billion cubic km\n    - C: 14 billion cubic km\n    - D: 140 billion cubic km\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) How can the concept of thermal expansion be understood through everyday experiences?\n    - A: It is only observed in extreme temperatures\n    - B: It is only applicable to solids\n    - C: It can be understood through experiences like boiling water or observing a thermometer\n    - D: It is not relevant to everyday life\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What happens to the particles in a substance as it heats up, according to the concept of thermal expansion?\n    - A: They move more slowly\n    - B: They remain stationary\n    - C: They move more vigorously\n    - D: They disappear\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is a key consequence of thermal expansion in the context of sea level rise?\n    - A: Decreased ocean volume\n    - B: Increased ocean salinity\n    - C: Increased ocean volume\n    - D: Decreased ocean temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What does the contrast between the melting of ice caps and glaciers and thermal expansion highlight?\n    - A: The simplicity of sea level rise\n    - B: The complexity of sea level rise\n    - C: The irrelevance of thermal expansion\n    - D: The sole cause of sea level rise\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is a key factor in understanding thermal expansion?\n    - A: The relationship between temperature and pressure\n    - B: The relationship between temperature and volume\n    - C: The relationship between pressure and volume\n    - D: The relationship between temperature and density\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What can be gained by combining the concepts of thermal expansion, sea level rise, and global climate change?\n    - A: A more fragmented understanding of the issue\n    - B: No new insights\n    - C: New insights into the interconnectedness of these phenomena\n    - D: A sole focus on thermal expansion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is required to evaluate the relative importance of thermal expansion versus melting ice caps and glaciers in contributing to sea level rise?\n    - A: Only recall of specific facts\n    - B: Only comprehension of key concepts\n    - C: Critical thinking and analysis\n    - D: No evaluation is necessary\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is involved in assessing the accuracy of predictions regarding sea level rise and its impacts on coastal communities?\n    - A: Only accepting the predictions at face value\n    - B: Only evaluating the underlying assumptions\n    - C: Evaluating the underlying assumptions and evidence\n    - D: Ignoring the predictions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nQuestions 11 and 12 were removed as they are somewhat redundant with questions 9 and 10. Questions 6, 8, and 9 were refined to improve clarity and conciseness."
