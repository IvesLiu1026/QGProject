    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary component of tendons and ligaments?\n    - A: Elastin\n    - B: Muscle fibers\n    - C: Bone tissue\n    - D: Collagen\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) According to research, what is the minimum duration of stretching per week required to see benefits in improved range of motion or flexibility?\n    - A: 1 minute\n    - B: 3 minutes\n    - C: 5 minutes\n    - D: 10 minutes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the scientific term for people with a greater range of motion?\n    - A: Flexibility\n    - B: Range of motion\n    - C: Hyper flexibility\n    - D: Hyper mobility\n[Correct answer]: C (Note: Both hyper flexibility and hyper mobility are correct terms, but the transcript uses hyper flexibility more frequently.)\n\n4) How can stretching modify sensation, according to Michael Rowley?\n    - A: Increasing pain sensitivity\n    - B: Decreasing pain sensitivity\n    - C: Desensitization to pain over time\n    - D: Increasing sensitivity to touch\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What type of stretching is considered the best method for improving range of motion or flexibility, according to the meta-analysis mentioned in the transcript?\n    - A: Dynamic stretching\n    - B: Ballistic stretching\n    - C: PNF stretching\n    - D: Static stretching\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What is the relationship between collagen types and hyper flexibility, according to Michael Rowley?\n    - A: Collagen types have no effect on hyper flexibility\n    - B: People with hyper flexibility tend to have a higher proportion of type I collagen\n    - C: People with hyper flexibility tend to have a higher proportion of type III collagen\n    - D: The relationship is unknown\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is one way to analyze the effects of stretching on muscles versus tendons and ligaments?\n    - A: Comparing the short-term effects on muscles versus the long-term effects on tendons and ligaments\n    - B: Comparing the long-term effects on muscles versus the short-term effects on tendons and ligaments\n    - C: Analyzing the effects of stretching on bones\n    - D: Analyzing the effects of stretching on joints\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What can be achieved by combining knowledge of biomechanics and stretching physiology?\n    - A: Development of a new stretching technique\n    - B: Creation of a personalized stretching program\n    - C: Understanding of the underlying mechanisms of stretching\n    - D: Development of a more effective stretching routine\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is required to justify the use of stretching as a means of improving range of motion or flexibility?\n    - A: Evaluation of the scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness\n    - B: Comparison with other forms of exercise\n    - C: Analysis of the underlying mechanisms of stretching\n    - D: Development of a new stretching technique\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) How often should stretching be done to see maximum benefits, according to the meta-analysis mentioned in the transcript?\n    - A: 3 days a week\n    - B: 5 days a week\n    - C: 6 days a week\n    - D: Every day\n[Correct answer]: C"
