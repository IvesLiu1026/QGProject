Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary function of the ozone layer in the Earth's atmosphere?\n    - A: To regulate the Earth's temperature\n    - B: To absorb two types of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun\n    - C: To produce oxygen and release carbon dioxide\n    - D: To protect against acid rain\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What international treaty aimed at reducing ozone-depleting substances was signed in 1987?\n    - A: The Paris Agreement\n    - B: The Montreal Protocol\n    - C: The Kyoto Protocol\n    - D: The Stockholm Convention\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What was the significance of the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica in 1985?\n    - A: It marked the beginning of the end of the ozone layer\n    - B: It was a wake-up call for scientists and the public to take action\n    - C: It proved that ozone depletion was not a real issue\n    - D: It showed that the ozone layer was self-healing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What was a crucial factor in the success of the Montreal Protocol?\n    - A: The lack of public awareness and pressure\n    - B: The public's awareness and pressure on leaders to act\n    - C: The failure of scientific research to understand ozone depletion\n    - D: The inability of countries to work together\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What lesson can be applied to other environmental issues based on the success of the Montreal Protocol?\n    - A: That collective action and international cooperation are ineffective\n    - B: That public awareness and pressure are unnecessary\n    - C: That alternative technologies and substitutes can be effective solutions\n    - D: That a single solution can solve all environmental problems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) Why do CFCs have a significant impact on ozone depletion?\n    - A: Due to their short lifetime in the atmosphere\n    - B: Due to their long lifetime in the atmosphere and cumulative impact\n    - C: Due to their inability to react with ozone molecules\n    - D: Due to their limited use in human activities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is a limitation of using HFCs as a substitute for CFCs?\n    - A: They contribute to ozone depletion\n    - B: They are not effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: They are not widely available\n    - D: They contribute to climate change\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the current status of the ozone hole, and what is expected to happen by 2065?\n    - A: The ozone hole is still growing and will continue to do so\n    - B: The ozone hole has stopped growing and is expected to recover completely\n    - C: The ozone hole has disappeared, but is expected to return\n    - D: The ozone hole is still present, but its size is unknown\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be integrated with other sustainable practices to reduce environmental impact?\n    - A: The use of ozone-depleting substances\n    - B: The use of alternative technologies and substitutes for ozone-depleting substances\n    - C: The reliance on a single solution to solve all environmental problems\n    - D: The neglect of public awareness and pressure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) How can the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol be evaluated?\n    - A: Based on its impact on the ozone layer\n    - B: Based on its failure to address climate change\n    - C: Based on the number of countries that signed the treaty\n    - D: Based on the lack of public awareness and pressure\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What are the three key factors that contributed to the success of the Montreal Protocol, according to Dr. Solomon?\n    - A: Personal, perceptible, and impractical\n    - B: Personal, perceptible, and practical\n    - C: Public, political, and practical\n    - D: Scientific, social, and economic\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the main environmental issue that still requires big solutions, according to the transcript?\n    - A: Ozone depletion\n    - B: Climate change\n    - C: Acid rain\n    - D: Deforestation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
