    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary function of the ozone layer in the Earth's atmosphere?\n    - A: To regulate the Earth's temperature\n    - B: To absorb two types of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun\n    - C: To produce oxygen and release carbon dioxide\n    - D: To protect against acid rain\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the name of the international treaty aimed at reducing ozone-depleting substances?\n    - A: The Paris Agreement\n    - B: The Montreal Protocol\n    - C: The Kyoto Protocol\n    - D: The Stockholm Convention\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why was the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica significant?\n    - A: It marked the beginning of the end of the ozone layer\n    - B: It was a wake-up call for scientists and the public to take action\n    - C: It proved that ozone depletion was not a real issue\n    - D: It showed that the ozone layer was self-healing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What was a key factor in the success of the Montreal Protocol?\n    - A: The lack of public awareness and pressure\n    - B: The public's awareness and pressure on leaders to act\n    - C: The failure of scientific research to understand ozone depletion\n    - D: The inability of countries to work together\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can the Montreal Protocol serve as a model for addressing other environmental problems?\n    - A: By promoting the use of ozone-depleting substances\n    - B: By demonstrating the effectiveness of collective action and international cooperation\n    - C: By ignoring the role of public awareness and pressure\n    - D: By focusing solely on scientific research\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can be applied to other environmental issues based on the success of the Montreal Protocol?\n    - A: The use of alternative technologies and substitutes for ozone-depleting substances\n    - B: The reliance on a single solution to solve all environmental problems\n    - C: The neglect of public awareness and pressure\n    - D: The failure to consider the cumulative impact of human activities\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between CFCs and ozone depletion?\n    - A: CFCs have no impact on ozone depletion\n    - B: CFCs contribute to ozone depletion through a cause-and-effect connection\n    - C: CFCs are a result of ozone depletion\n    - D: CFCs are a natural part of the ozone layer\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) Why do CFCs have a significant impact on ozone depletion?\n    - A: Due to their short lifetime in the atmosphere\n    - B: Due to their long lifetime in the atmosphere and cumulative impact\n    - C: Due to their inability to react with ozone molecules\n    - D: Due to their limited use in human activities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a limitation of using HFCs as a substitute for CFCs?\n    - A: They contribute to ozone depletion\n    - B: They are not effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: They are not widely available\n    - D: They contribute to climate change\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) How can the success of the Montreal Protocol be combined with other environmental initiatives?\n    - A: By creating a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change\n    - B: By ignoring the role of public awareness and pressure\n    - C: By focusing solely on scientific research\n    - D: By promoting the use of ozone-depleting substances\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What can be integrated with other sustainable practices to reduce environmental impact?\n    - A: The use of ozone-depleting substances\n    - B: The use of alternative technologies and substitutes for ozone-depleting substances\n    - C: The reliance on a single solution to solve all environmental problems\n    - D: The neglect of public awareness and pressure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) How can the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol be evaluated?\n    - A: Based on its impact on the ozone layer\n    - B: Based on its failure to address climate change\n    - C: Based on the number of countries that signed the treaty\n    - D: Based on the lack of public awareness and pressure\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed some redundant questions and rephrased others to make them more concise and clear. I also ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
