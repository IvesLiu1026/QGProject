The ozone layer protects every living thing by absorbing two types of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.\n3. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are a man-made compound that contributes to ozone depletion.\n4. The Montreal Protocol is an international treaty aimed at reducing ozone-depleting substances.\n5. The treaty was signed by every single country and is the only universal treaty to be ratified.\n6. The consumption of ozone-depleting substances, including CFCs, plummeted after the protocol went into effect.\n7. The ozone hole has stopped growing and is now shrinking.\n8. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The ozone layer is fragile and can be depleted by human activities.\n2. The discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica was a wake-up call for scientists and the public.\n3. The Montreal Protocol was a response to the growing threat of ozone depletion and its potential consequences.\n4. The treaty's success was due to the public's awareness and pressure on leaders to act.\n5. Climate change is a pressing environmental issue that requires big solutions.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. The Montreal Protocol can serve as a model for addressing other environmental problems, such as climate change.\n2. The use of alternative technologies and substitutes for ozone-depleting substances can be applied to other environmental issues.\n3. Public awareness and pressure can be effective in pushing leaders to take action on environmental issues.\n4. The success of the Montreal Protocol demonstrates that collective action can lead to significant positive change.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between CFCs and ozone depletion is a cause-and-effect connection.\n2. The long lifetime of CFCs in the atmosphere contributes to their cumulative impact on ozone depletion.\n3. The Montreal Protocol's success was due to a combination of factors, including public awareness, scientific research, and international cooperation.\n4. The use of HFCs as a substitute for CFCs has led to a new environmental problem, highlighting the need for continued innovation and problem-solving.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The Montreal Protocol's success can be combined with other environmental initiatives to create a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change.\n2. The use of alternative technologies and substitutes for ozone-depleting substances can be integrated with other sustainable practices to reduce environmental impact.\n3. The public's awareness and pressure can be leveraged to push for policy changes and technological innovations that address climate change.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol in reducing ozone-depleting substances can be evaluated based on its impact on the ozone layer.\n2. The use of HFCs as a substitute for CFCs can be critiqued for its contribution to climate change.\n3. The success of the Montreal Protocol can be justified as a model for addressing other environmental problems, such as climate change.\n4. The need for continued innovation and problem-solving in addressing environmental issues can be evaluated based on the emergence of new challenges, such as climate change."
