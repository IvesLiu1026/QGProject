    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) What is the primary method through which COVID-19 is spread?\n    - A: Through contaminated food and water\n    - B: Through air currents carrying microscopic droplets of coronavirus\n    - C: Through direct contact with an infected person\n    - D: Through insect vectors\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What type of imaging technique can visualize airflow and the spread of coronavirus?\n    - A: MRI imaging\n    - B: CT scanning\n    - C: Schlieren imaging\n    - D: X-ray imaging\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) How do masks help slow airborne infection, according to the concept of schlieren imaging?\n    - A: By capturing smaller droplets and allowing larger droplets to pass through\n    - B: By capturing larger droplets and reducing the momentum of smaller droplets\n    - C: By filtering out all droplets, regardless of size\n    - D: By creating a barrier that prevents all airflow\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why is it essential for a mask to fit properly to be effective?\n    - A: So that it can filter out all droplets, regardless of size\n    - B: So that it can capture larger droplets and reduce the momentum of smaller droplets\n    - C: So that it can create a tight seal around the face and prevent air from escaping\n    - D: So that it can be worn comfortably for extended periods\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application**\n\n1) A public health official wants to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in a crowded public place. What policy would be most effective?\n    - A: Implementing a handwashing station\n    - B: Implementing a mask-wearing policy\n    - C: Implementing a physical distancing policy\n    - D: Implementing a temperature-checking station\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A person wants to protect themselves and others from COVID-19. What combination of safety measures would be most effective?\n    - A: Wearing a mask and washing hands frequently\n    - B: Wearing a mask and maintaining physical distancing\n    - C: Washing hands frequently and maintaining physical distancing\n    - D: Wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, and maintaining physical distancing\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the size of viral particles and the weave of fabrics?\n    - A: Viral particles are larger than the weave of most fabrics\n    - B: Viral particles are smaller than the weave of most fabrics\n    - C: Viral particles are the same size as the weave of most fabrics\n    - D: The size of viral particles is irrelevant to the weave of fabrics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the main difference between the effectiveness of N95 masks and cloth masks?\n    - A: N95 masks are more comfortable to wear\n    - B: N95 masks filter out smaller droplets than cloth masks\n    - C: Cloth masks are more breathable than N95 masks\n    - D: N95 masks are more expensive than cloth masks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) How could the concepts of schlieren imaging and mask effectiveness be combined to develop new strategies for reducing the spread of COVID-19?\n    - A: By using schlieren imaging to study the spread of coronavirus in different environments and designing new masks that take into account the principles of schlieren imaging\n    - B: By using schlieren imaging to study the spread of coronavirus in different environments and implementing mask-wearing policies in public places\n    - C: By designing new masks that take into account the principles of schlieren imaging and implementing physical distancing policies\n    - D: By using schlieren imaging to study the spread of coronavirus in different environments and developing new technologies to improve mask effectiveness\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What would be the most effective way to integrate mask-wearing with other safety measures to create a comprehensive approach to preventing the spread of COVID-19?\n    - A: By implementing mask-wearing policies in public places and encouraging handwashing and physical distancing\n    - B: By designing new masks that take into account the principles of schlieren imaging and implementing physical distancing policies\n    - C: By using schlieren imaging to study the spread of coronavirus in different environments and developing new technologies to improve mask effectiveness\n    - D: By creating public health campaigns that emphasize the importance of mask-wearing and social distancing\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) What would be the most effective way to assess the effectiveness of different types of masks in reducing the spread of COVID-19?\n    - A: By conducting a randomized controlled trial\n    - B: By conducting a observational study\n    - C: By conducting a laboratory experiment\n    - D: By conducting a survey of public health officials\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What would be the most effective way to evaluate the impact of mask-wearing policies on public health outcomes?\n    - A: By analyzing data on COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations before and after the implementation of mask-wearing policies\n    - B: By conducting a survey of public health officials\n    - C: By conducting a laboratory experiment\n    - D: By conducting a randomized controlled trial\n[Correct answer]: A"
