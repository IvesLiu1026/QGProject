    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary function of the appendix in the human body?\n    - A: To aid in digestion\n    - B: To hold gut bacteria\n    - C: To regulate body temperature\n    - D: To produce hormones\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes needed.\n\n2) Who wrote the book \"On the Origin of Species\"?\n    - A: Charles Dickens\n    - B: Charles Darwin\n    - C: Galileo Galilei\n    - D: Isaac Newton\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes needed.\n\n3) What are vestigial structures in humans?\n    - A: Body parts that have evolved to become more complex and are necessary for survival\n    - B: Remnants of body parts that were once useful but are no longer needed due to changes in the environment or lifestyle\n    - C: Body parts that have been genetically engineered to become obsolete\n    - D: Body parts that have been damaged due to disease or injury\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness.\n\n4) According to Darwin's theory of evolution, why do humans and other animals have vestigial structures?\n    - A: Because they are necessary for survival\n    - B: Because they are remnants of body parts that were once useful but are no longer needed\n    - C: Because they are a result of genetic mutation\n    - D: Because they are a result of environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness.\n\n5) What is a common issue associated with wisdom teeth in modern humans?\n    - A: They are too small\n    - B: They are too large\n    - C: They are impacted and cause discomfort\n    - D: They are missing\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to focus on the specific issue with wisdom teeth.\n\n6) How can understanding vestigial structures inform our appreciation of human evolution?\n    - A: By showing us that humans have not evolved over time\n    - B: By highlighting the similarities between humans and other animals\n    - C: By demonstrating the gradual changes that have occurred in the human body over millions of years\n    - D: By proving that evolution is a myth\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness.\n\n7) What can be inferred about human evolution by comparing vestigial structures in humans and other animals?\n    - A: That humans and other animals have evolved separately and have no common ancestors\n    - B: That humans and other animals have evolved from a common ancestor and share similar body parts\n    - C: That humans and other animals have not evolved over time\n    - D: That vestigial structures are unique to humans and do not exist in other animals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness.\n\n8) What does the presence of vestigial structures in humans reveal about the changes that have occurred in the human body over time?\n    - A: That the human body has remained unchanged over millions of years\n    - B: That the human body has evolved to become more complex and sophisticated\n    - C: That the human body has undergone gradual changes in response to environmental and lifestyle factors\n    - D: That the human body has been genetically engineered to retain vestigial structures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness.\n\n9) How can combining the concepts of vestigial structures and evolution lead to a deeper understanding of the history of life on Earth?\n    - A: By showing us that evolution is a random and unguided process\n    - B: By highlighting the interconnectedness of all living things and the gradual changes that have occurred over millions of years\n    - C: By proving that evolution is a myth and that creationism is the correct explanation for the origin of life\n    - D: By demonstrating that humans and other animals have evolved separately and have no common ancestors\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness.\n\n10) What insights can be gained from recognizing the presence of vestigial structures in humans and other animals?\n    - A: That humans and other animals are separate and distinct species with no common ancestors\n    - B: That humans and other animals share a common ancestor and have evolved over time\n    - C: That vestigial structures are unique to humans and do not exist in other animals\n    - D: That the presence of vestigial structures is evidence against evolution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness.\n\n11) How can the significance of vestigial structures in supporting the theory of evolution be evaluated?\n    - A: By considering only the evidence from biology and ignoring other fields of study\n    - B: By considering the evidence from multiple fields of study, including biology, anthropology, and paleontology\n    - C: By relying solely on personal opinion and ignoring scientific evidence\n    - D: By assuming that vestigial structures are irrelevant to the theory of evolution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness.\n\n12) What is the relevance of vestigial structures to our understanding of human evolution?\n    - A: Vestigial structures are irrelevant to our understanding of human evolution\n    - B: Vestigial structures provide evidence of human evolution and the gradual changes that have occurred in the human body over millions of years\n    - C: Vestigial structures are only relevant to our understanding of human anatomy\n    - D: Vestigial structures are only relevant to our understanding of human behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
