    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is the approximate age of the universe?\n    - A: 10 billion years\n    - B: 13.8 billion years\n    - C: 15 billion years\n    - D: 20 billion years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What does the Universe with a capital U refer to?\n    - A: Only the observable universe\n    - B: Everything that exists, has existed, or will exist\n    - C: Only the universe that we can see\n    - D: The universe that is currently expanding\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) Why is the distinction between the observable universe and the whole universe necessary for scientific discussion?\n    - A: Because it helps us understand the universe's age\n    - B: Because it helps us understand the universe's composition\n    - C: Because it highlights the limitations of our knowledge\n    - D: Because it is necessary for understanding the concept of parallel universes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What gives rise to gravity, matter, and forces in the universe?\n    - A: The universe's age and composition\n    - B: The universe's expansion and contraction\n    - C: The interaction between spacetime, particles, and physical laws\n    - D: The concept of parallel universes or multiverses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application (Real-world Scenarios)**\n\n1) Why may we not be able to see distant objects or events?\n    - A: Because they are too small\n    - B: Because they are too far away and light takes time to travel through space\n    - C: Because they are not emitting any light\n    - D: Because they are blocked by other objects\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) In what field can the concept of parallel universes or multiverses be explored?\n    - A: Only in science fiction\n    - B: Only in theoretical physics\n    - C: In both science fiction and theoretical physics\n    - D: In neither science fiction nor theoretical physics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and Contrasts)**\n\n1) What does the relationship between the observable universe and the whole universe highlight?\n    - A: The complexity of the universe\n    - B: The limitations of our knowledge\n    - C: The universe's age and composition\n    - D: The concept of parallel universes or multiverses\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What explains why we may not be able to see distant objects?\n    - A: The connection between the universe's age and expansion\n    - B: The connection between the universe's age and the time it takes for light to travel through space\n    - C: The connection between spacetime, particles, and physical laws\n    - D: The concept of parallel universes or multiverses\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1) What does the concept of the multiverse raise questions about?\n    - A: The nature of reality and the possibility of other universes with different physical laws\n    - B: The universe's age and composition\n    - C: The concept of parallel universes or multiverses\n    - D: The interaction between spacetime, particles, and physical laws\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What can be used to infer the existence of phenomena that are not directly observable?\n    - A: The relationship between the universe's age and expansion\n    - B: The relationship between the universe's age, composition, and the laws of physics\n    - C: The connection between spacetime, particles, and physical laws\n    - D: The concept of parallel universes or multiverses\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and Critique)**\n\n1) How can the concept of parallel universes or multiverses be evaluated?\n    - A: Only in terms of its scientific validity\n    - B: Only in terms of its implications\n    - C: In terms of both its scientific validity and implications\n    - D: In neither terms of its scientific validity nor implications\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What can be critiqued in terms of its philosophical and mathematical implications?\n    - A: The concept of parallel universes or multiverses\n    - B: The idea that mathematics exists outside of the universe\n    - C: The universe's age and composition\n    - D: The interaction between spacetime, particles, and physical laws\n[Correct answer]: B"
