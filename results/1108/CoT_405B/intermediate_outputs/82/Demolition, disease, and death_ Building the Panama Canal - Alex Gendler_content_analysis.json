The California gold rush brought thousands of settlers to America's west coast in the mid-19th century.\n2. The Isthmus of Panama is 48 kilometers wide.\n3. A railroad spanning the region was built by 1855.\n4. The first attempt at building the Panama Canal was made by French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps in 1881.\n5. De Lesseps had previously supervised the construction of the Suez Canal.\n6. The French abandoned the project after spending $287 million and losing 22,000 lives.\n7. The United States considered building a canal through Nicaragua.\n8. Panama gained independence from Colombia in 1903.\n9. The Americans built the canal using massive steel gates and a lock system.\n10. The Gatun Dam is 32 meters high and over 800 meters wide.\n11. The canal took over nine years to complete and required the excavation of 76 million cubic meters of rock.\n12. The canal was opened in 1913 and is now used by nearly 14,000 vessels annually.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The California gold rush led to an increased need for a faster and more efficient way to transport goods and people between the east and west coasts of the United States.\n2. The Isthmus of Panama was a critical location for building a canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n3. The French attempt at building the canal failed due to a combination of factors, including the difficulty of excavating through the Continental Divide mountain range and the challenges of working in a tropical environment.\n4. The Americans learned from the French mistakes and developed a new plan to build the canal using a lock system and a massive dam.\n5. The construction of the canal required significant infrastructure development, including the building of a railway and the excavation of a large amount of rock.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. The construction of the Panama Canal is an example of how a large-scale engineering project can be used to solve a real-world problem.\n2. The use of a lock system and a massive dam in the construction of the canal demonstrates the importance of innovative thinking and problem-solving in engineering.\n3. The challenges faced by the French and American teams during the construction of the canal highlight the importance of careful planning and preparation in large-scale engineering projects.\n4. The Panama Canal is an example of how a critical piece of infrastructure can have a significant impact on global trade and commerce.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The French attempt at building the canal failed due to a combination of technical and logistical challenges, while the American attempt succeeded due to a combination of innovative thinking and careful planning.\n2. The use of a lock system and a massive dam in the construction of the canal allowed the Americans to overcome the technical challenges that had defeated the French.\n3. The construction of the canal required significant infrastructure development, including the building of a railway and the excavation of a large amount of rock.\n4. The challenges faced by the French and American teams during the construction of the canal highlight the importance of careful planning and preparation in large-scale engineering projects.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The construction of the Panama Canal is an example of how a large-scale engineering project can be used to solve a real-world problem, and how innovative thinking and problem-solving can be used to overcome technical challenges.\n2. The use of a lock system and a massive dam in the construction of the canal demonstrates the importance of interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration in engineering.\n3. The Panama Canal is an example of how a critical piece of infrastructure can have a significant impact on global trade and commerce, and how it can be used to drive economic growth and development.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The decision by the French to attempt to build the canal at sea level was a critical mistake that ultimately led to the failure of the project.\n2. The American decision to use a lock system and a massive dam in the construction of the canal was a key factor in the success of the project.\n3. The construction of the canal required significant investment and sacrifice, including the loss of thousands of lives and the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n4. The impact of the Panama Canal on global trade and commerce has been significant, and it continues to play a critical role in the global economy today."
