Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004 and was completed in 2009.\n3. The Burj Khalifa is 828 meters tall and surpassed the previous record holder by over 60%.\n4. Fazlur Rahman Khan is known as the father of modern skyscrapers.\n5. Khan developed the tubular design, which features a steel and concrete exoskeleton.\n6. The Burj Khalifa was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) and features a buttressed core design.\n7. The building has 163 floors and a Y-shaped layout to minimize local wind forces.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n1. The introduction of industrial steel in the early 20th century allowed buildings to shed weight and reach new heights.\n2. Tall steel skyscrapers had limitations, including vulnerability to strong winds and the need for intensive labor to produce.\n3. Fazlur Rahman Khan's tubular design revolutionized skyscraper construction by providing a more resilient and efficient way to build tall structures.\n4. The buttressed core design used in the Burj Khalifa allowed the entire structure to work as a single load-bearing unit.\n5. The Burj Khalifa's design strategically places the strongest load-bearing areas where the wind is most powerful.\n\n**Application**:\n1. The use of tubular designs and buttressed cores in skyscraper construction can be applied to future building projects to achieve greater heights and efficiency.\n2. The Burj Khalifa's Y-shaped layout and spiral shape can be used as a model for minimizing local wind forces in tall buildings.\n3. The construction of the Burj Khalifa highlights the importance of prioritizing worker safety and protection laws in large-scale building projects.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. The relationship between the introduction of industrial steel and the development of taller skyscrapers can be analyzed to understand the impact of new materials on building design.\n2. The contrast between the limitations of traditional steel skyscrapers and the benefits of Khan's tubular design can be analyzed to understand the significance of innovative design solutions.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the use of buttressed core design and the ability to build taller structures can be analyzed to understand the impact of design innovations on building capabilities.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n1. Combining the ideas of tubular designs and buttressed cores could lead to the development of even more efficient and resilient skyscraper designs.\n2. Integrating innovative materials and design solutions, such as those used in the Burj Khalifa, could lead to the creation of more sustainable and environmentally friendly buildings.\n3. Considering the human cost of large-scale building projects, such as the Burj Khalifa, could lead to the development of more equitable and humane construction practices.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n1. The ethics of prioritizing building projects over worker safety and protection laws can be evaluated to determine the moral implications of such practices.\n2. The impact of the Burj Khalifa's design on the environment and local ecosystem can be evaluated to determine its sustainability and environmental friendliness.\n3. The effectiveness of the buttressed core design in withstanding natural disasters and extreme weather conditions can be evaluated to determine its reliability and durability."
