    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the estimated number of neurons in the human brain?\n    - A: 50 billion\n    - B: 70 billion\n    - C: 86 billion\n    - D: 100 billion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the approximate latency of a dragonfly's response to prey?\n    - A: 20 milliseconds\n    - B: 30 milliseconds\n    - C: 40 milliseconds\n    - D: 50 milliseconds\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) Why is the speaker studying the dragonfly brain?\n    - A: To understand how animal nervous systems solve particular problems\n    - B: To develop a new type of computer software\n    - C: To study the behavior of insects\n    - D: To understand the human brain\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is a key advantage of studying smaller brains, such as the dragonfly brain?\n    - A: They are more complex than the human brain\n    - B: They are more difficult to study than the human brain\n    - C: They can perform specific tasks with great efficiency and have fewer neurons to study\n    - D: They are less efficient than the human brain\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is the speaker trying to create by studying the human brain and insect brains?\n    - A: A new type of robot\n    - B: A new type of computer chip\n    - C: Artificial intelligence that replicates how biological brains work\n    - D: A new type of medical device\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential application of brain-inspired computers?\n    - A: Developing more efficient air conditioning systems\n    - B: Creating more efficient and low-power devices, vehicles, and artificial intelligences\n    - C: Developing new medical treatments\n    - D: Creating more efficient solar panels\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How many neurons does the dragonfly brain have?\n    - A: 100,000\n    - B: 1 million\n    - C: 10 million\n    - D: 100 million\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the potential benefit of developing brain-inspired computers in terms of power requirements?\n    - A: They would require more power\n    - B: They would require the same amount of power\n    - C: They would require less power\n    - D: They would not require any power\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What sets the speaker's approach to artificial intelligence apart from traditional approaches?\n    - A: The speaker's approach is more complex\n    - B: The speaker's approach is more traditional\n    - C: The speaker is studying insect brains to replicate biological brain function\n    - D: The speaker is not using computers\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What could be a potential outcome of integrating insect brain research with brain-inspired computer development?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of brain function\n    - B: A new type of computer chip\n    - C: A new type of robot\n    - D: A new medical treatment\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions that were redundant or not aligned with the key concepts. I also rephrased some questions to make them clearer and more concise. Additionally, I ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
