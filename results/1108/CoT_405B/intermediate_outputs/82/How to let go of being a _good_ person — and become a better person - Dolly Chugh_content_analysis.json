The concept of bounded rationality, which states that the human mind has limited storage resources and processing power, leading to reliance on shortcuts.\n2. The idea of bounded ethicality, which applies the concept of bounded rationality to ethical decision-making.\n3. The statistics that 11 million pieces of information are processed by the brain in a given moment, but only 40 are processed consciously.\n4. The existence of unconscious bias and its effects on decision-making.\n5. The concept of conflicts of interest and how they can affect decision-making.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The importance of moral identity and how it affects our behavior and decision-making.\n2. The idea that our attachment to being good people can get in the way of us being better people.\n3. The concept of the \"red zone\" and how it relates to defensiveness and protecting our moral identity.\n4. The idea that our self-view as a good person affects our behavior and decision-making.\n5.

The relationship between bounded rationality and bounded ethicality, and how they impact decision-making.\n2. The contrast between our conscious and unconscious beliefs, and how they affect our behavior.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between our attachment to being good people and our defensiveness when challenged.\n4. The relationship between our self-view as a good person and our behavior, and how it affects our decision-making.\n5. The comparison between the traditional notion of a \"good person\" and the concept of a \"good-ish person\".\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. Combining the concepts of bounded rationality and bounded ethicality to understand how our brains process information and make decisions.\n2. Integrating the ideas of unconscious bias and conflicts of interest to understand how they impact decision-making.\n3. Merging the concepts of moral identity and self-view to understand how they affect our behavior and decision-making.\n4. Creating a new understanding of what it means to be a \"good person\" by combining the ideas of growth, improvement, and self-awareness.\n5. Developing a new approach to ethics and decision-making by synthesizing the concepts of bounded ethicality and the \"good-ish person\".\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of the traditional notion of a \"good person\" in promoting moral behavior.\n2. Assessing the impact of unconscious bias and conflicts of interest on decision-making and behavior.\n3. Justifying the importance of self-reflection and self-awareness in improving moral identity and decision-making.\n4.
