B: By practicing self-reflection and self-awareness.\n    - C: By blaming others for their biases.\n    - D: By denying the impact of unconscious bias on decision-making.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is an example of applying the concept of bounded ethicality to a real-world scenario?\n    -

B: Bounded rationality leads to bounded ethicality, as our limited cognitive resources affect our ethical decision-making.\n    - C: Bounded ethicality leads to bounded rationality, as our ethical considerations affect our cognitive resources.\n    - D: They are identical concepts that refer to the same thing.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the contrast between our conscious and unconscious beliefs, and how do they affect our behavior?\n    - A: Our conscious beliefs always override our unconscious biases.\n    - B: Our unconscious biases have no impact on our behavior.\n    - C: Our conscious and unconscious beliefs often conflict, leading to inconsistent behavior.\n    - D: Our unconscious biases always align with our conscious beliefs.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) What is the result of combining the concepts of bounded rationality and bounded ethicality?\n    - A: A complete understanding of how our brains process information and make decisions.\n    - B: A new approach to ethics and decision-making that ignores the impact of unconscious bias.\n    - C: A deeper understanding of how our cognitive limitations affect our ethical decision-making.\n    - D: A rejection of the concept of bounded rationality in favor of bounded ethicality.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the result of integrating the ideas of unconscious bias and conflicts of interest?\n    - A: A complete elimination of unconscious bias and conflicts of interest.\n    - B: A deeper understanding of how these factors impact decision-making and behavior.\n    - C: A new approach to ethics and decision-making that prioritizes personal gain.\n    - D: A rejection of the concept of unconscious bias in favor of conflicts of interest.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) What is the effectiveness of the traditional notion of a \"good person\" in promoting moral behavior?\n    -

A: It is unnecessary and can even be counterproductive.\n    - B: It is somewhat important, but not crucial.\n    - C: It is essential for improving moral identity and decision-making.\n    - D: It is only important for certain individuals, not everyone.\n[Correct answer]: C"
