    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level based on the content analysis:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) What percentage of Earth's atmosphere is composed of nitrogen generated by volcanic activity?\n    - A: 50%\n    - B: 60%\n    - C: 78%\n    - D: 90%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which gas accounts for 0.93% of the air and is formed from the radioactive decay of potassium?\n    - A: Argon\n    - B: Oxygen\n    - C: Nitrogen\n    - D: Carbon dioxide\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) What is the origin of oxygen gas in the Earth's atmosphere?\n    - A: Volcanic activity\n    - B: The evolution of ocean-dwelling microorganisms\n    - C: The interaction of primary pollutants with natural compounds\n    - D: The decay of potassium\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why are regional responses necessary to address air pollution?\n    - A: Because air pollution is a local issue\n    - B: Because air pollution is a global issue, but regional pollutant profiles vary\n    - C: Because human activities have no impact on air quality\n    - D: Because air pollution is only caused by natural sources\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n\n1) A city is experiencing high levels of air pollution due to industrial activities. What strategy could be employed to reduce air pollution?\n    - A: Increase the number of cars on the road\n    - B: Implement regulations to reduce emissions from industrial sources\n    - C: Plant more trees to absorb pollutants\n    - D: Reduce the use of public transportation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A policymaker wants to develop targeted regulations to reduce air pollution. What information would be most useful to them?\n    - A: The composition of the air in a specific region\n    - B: The effects of primary and secondary pollutants on human health\n    - C: The impact of human activities on air quality\n    - D: The percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between human activities and air pollution?\n    - A: Human activities have no impact on air pollution\n    - B: Human activities are the primary cause of air pollution\n    - C: Human activities are a minor contributor to air pollution\n    - D: Human activities only affect air pollution in urban areas\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the contrast between primary and secondary pollutants?\n    - A: Primary pollutants are formed through the interaction of natural compounds, while secondary pollutants are directly emitted from a source\n    - B: Primary pollutants are directly emitted from a source, while secondary pollutants are formed through the interaction of primary pollutants with natural compounds\n    - C: Primary pollutants are only caused by human activities, while secondary pollutants are only caused by natural sources\n    - D: Primary pollutants are only found in urban areas, while secondary pollutants are only found in rural areas\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) What could be the result of integrating knowledge of air composition, pollutant sources, and regional responses?\n    - A: The development of a new air pollutant\n    - B: The creation of a new technology to reduce air pollution\n    - C: The development of effective air pollution mitigation strategies\n    - D: The increase of air pollution levels\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What could be the result of combining understanding of primary and secondary pollutants?\n    - A: The development of a new regulation to reduce air pollution\n    - B: The creation of a new technology to reduce air pollution\n    - C: The design of targeted regulations and technologies to reduce air pollution\n    - D: The increase of air pollution levels\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) What would be an effective way to assess the effectiveness of regional responses to air pollution?\n    - A: By comparing the air quality of different regions\n    - B: By evaluating the impact of human activities on air quality\n    - C: By identifying areas for improvement and revising regulations accordingly\n    - D: By ignoring regional differences and implementing a one-size-fits-all approach\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What would be a valid justification for promoting international cooperation to address air pollution?\n    - A: Air pollution is a local issue and does not require international cooperation\n    - B: Air pollution is a global issue and requires international cooperation to address\n    - C: Human activities have no impact on air quality\n    - D: Air pollution is only caused by natural sources\n[Correct answer]: B"
