    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the power capacity of the world's biggest lithium-ion battery connected to the Southern California power grid?\n    - A: 100 million watts\n    - B: 250 million watts\n    - C: 500 million watts\n    - D: 1 billion watts\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How much greenhouse gas is currently produced per year to generate enough electricity to power the world?\n    - A: 5 billion tons\n    - B: 10 billion tons\n    - C: 14 billion tons\n    - D: 20 billion tons\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What concept do the two lakes illustrate in the context of energy storage?\n    - A: Kinetic energy conversion\n    - B: Gravitational potential energy storage\n    - C: Chemical energy storage\n    - D: Thermal energy storage\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why are lithium-ion batteries less suitable for large-scale energy storage?\n    - A: Due to their high energy density\n    - B: Because of their long lifespan\n    - C: Due to their size, weight, and resource requirements\n    - D: Because of their low cost\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is a potential application of the two-lake system as a model for energy storage?\n    - A: Powering small homes in remote areas\n    - B: Supporting widespread adoption of clean energy sources\n    - C: Providing backup power for data centers\n    - D: Powering electric vehicles\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How can energy storage solutions be integrated into existing power grids to improve efficiency?\n    - A: By replacing traditional power plants\n    - B: By providing backup power during outages\n    - C: By storing excess energy generated by clean energy sources\n    - D: By increasing energy consumption\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between energy storage capacity and greenhouse gas emissions?\n    - A: As energy storage capacity increases, greenhouse gas emissions increase\n    - B: As energy storage capacity increases, greenhouse gas emissions remain the same\n    - C: As energy storage capacity increases, greenhouse gas emissions can decrease\n    - D: As energy storage capacity decreases, greenhouse gas emissions decrease\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a trade-off between lithium-ion batteries and other battery technologies, such as the two-lake system?\n    - A: Size and weight vs. energy density\n    - B: Cost vs. lifespan\n    - C: Environmental impact vs. energy storage capacity\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What could be a potential benefit of combining the concept of the two-lake system with other energy storage technologies?\n    - A: Increased energy storage capacity\n    - B: Improved efficiency\n    - C: Reduced environmental impact\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What could be a potential outcome of developing new battery technologies that address the limitations of existing technologies?\n    - A: Increased reliance on fossil fuels\n    - B: Reduced energy storage capacity\n    - C: Improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact\n    - D: Increased greenhouse gas emissions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a justification for investing in new battery technologies to support a sustainable future?\n    - A: The high cost of existing battery technologies\n    - B: The limitations of lithium-ion batteries\n    - C: The need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support widespread adoption of clean energy sources\n    - D: The lack of energy storage capacity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of different battery technologies in reducing greenhouse gas emissions?\n    - A: Energy storage capacity\n    - B: Cost\n    - C: Environmental impact\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 3 and 4 to improve clarity and conciseness. The other questions remain unchanged, as they align with the key concepts and have plausible but incorrect distractors."
