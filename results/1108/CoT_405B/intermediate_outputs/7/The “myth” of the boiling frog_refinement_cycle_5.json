    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the estimated global average temperature rise since 1850?\n    - A: 0.5 degrees Celsius\n    - B: 1 degree Celsius\n    - C: 1.5 degrees Celsius\n    - D: 2 degrees Celsius\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) According to scientists, what is the predicted temperature rise from pre-industrial levels by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current pace?\n    - A: 2 degrees Celsius\n    - B: 3 degrees Celsius\n    - C: 4 degrees Celsius\n    - D: 5 degrees Celsius\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the main purpose of using the parable of the frogs in the context of climate change?\n    - A: To illustrate the effects of climate change on ecosystems\n    - B: To demonstrate the importance of scientific research on climate change\n    - C: To illustrate human behavior in the face of gradual changes, such as climate change\n    - D: To highlight the role of individual actions in mitigating climate change\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What does the concept of \"net zero emissions\" refer to?\n    - A: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero immediately\n    - B: Balancing the amount of greenhouse gases emitted and removed from the atmosphere\n    - C: Increasing the use of fossil fuels to meet energy demands\n    - D: Implementing policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions only\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can the concept of net zero emissions be achieved in real-world scenarios?\n    - A: By transitioning to clean energy sources and balancing emissions and removals\n    - B: By increasing the use of fossil fuels and implementing policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions\n    - C: By reducing energy consumption only\n    - D: By relying solely on natural methods to remove greenhouse gases\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) According to the transcript, what is an example of observing the effects of climate change in different regions?\n    - A: Comparing the effects of climate change in the Arctic and the Amazon rainforest\n    - B: Studying the effects of climate change on polar bear populations only\n    - C: Analyzing the effects of climate change in the Arctic and Mumbai\n    - D: Examining the effects of climate change on coral reefs only\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the cause-and-effect connection between burning fossil fuels and global warming?\n    - A: Burning fossil fuels releases oxygen, which cools the planet\n    - B: Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, which absorbs infrared wavelengths and warms the planet\n    - C: Burning fossil fuels has no effect on global warming\n    - D: Burning fossil fuels releases methane, which is the primary cause of global warming\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) (Removed due to duplication with question 7)\n\n9) What is the relationship between greenhouse gases and the trapping of heat in the atmosphere?\n    - A: Greenhouse gases absorb infrared wavelengths and cool the planet\n    - B: Greenhouse gases absorb infrared wavelengths and warm the planet\n    - C: Greenhouse gases have no effect on the trapping of heat in the atmosphere\n    - D: Greenhouse gases release heat from the atmosphere\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a crucial step in mitigating climate change?\n    - A: Increasing the use of fossil fuels and implementing policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions\n    - B: Transitioning to clean energy sources and balancing emissions and removals\n    - C: Reducing energy consumption only\n    - D: Implementing policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions only\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the most urgent action needed to mitigate climate change?\n    - A: Reducing energy consumption only\n    - B: Implementing policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions only\n    - C: Transitioning to clean energy sources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\n    - D: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through multiple strategies, including transitioning to clean energy sources and balancing emissions and removals\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-7, 9-11. Question 8 was removed due to duplication."
