The battery can provide 250 million watts of power, enough to power 250,000 homes.\n3. A battery is defined as something that stores energy and releases it on demand.\n4. Lithium-ion batteries store energy in lithium ions and release it by separating ions from their electrons.\n5. The two-lake system stores energy by pumping water from the lower lake to the higher lake, giving it gravitational potential energy.\n6. The two-lake system can generate 3 billion watts of power for 10 hours.\n7. Currently, generating enough electricity to power the world produces 14 billion tons of greenhouse gas per year.\n8. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero.\n9. Many clean energy sources cannot produce electricity 24/7, requiring energy storage solutions.\n10.
