Menstruation is a unique phenomenon among mammals, occurring in humans, some primates, bats, the elephant shrew, and the spiny mouse.\n2. The brain triggers the ovary to produce an egg, releasing estrogen, which builds up the lining of the uterus.\n3. Progesterone is released during ovulation, acting as a mortar to hold the uterine lining together.\n4. The uterine lining releases substances that are made into chemicals called prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators, causing cramping and pain.\n5. The pressure generated in the uterus during menstruation is 120 millimeters of mercury, equivalent to the pressure during the second stage of labor.\n6. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) can reduce menstrual pain for 80% of women and reduce blood volume by 30-40%.\n7. Hormonal contraception can give a thinner uterine lining, reducing prostaglandins and blood volume.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The speaker describes their personal experience with heavy periods, cramps, and period diarrhea, highlighting the lack of understanding and support.\n2. The concept of menstruation as a natural process is contrasted with societal taboos and shame.\n3.
