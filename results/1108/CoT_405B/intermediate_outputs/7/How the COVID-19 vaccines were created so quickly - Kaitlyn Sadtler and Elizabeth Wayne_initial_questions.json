    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is the typical storage temperature range for mRNA vaccines?\n    - A: 0 to 10 degrees Celsius\n    - B: -20 to -80 degrees Celsius\n    - C: 20 to 30 degrees Celsius\n    - D: 30 to 40 degrees Celsius\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary function of mRNA in the human body?\n    - A: To encode instructions for producing carbohydrates\n    - B: To encode instructions for producing proteins\n    - C: To encode instructions for producing lipids\n    - D: To encode instructions for producing nucleic acids\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) How does the mRNA vaccine trigger an immune response in the body?\n    - A: By introducing a live virus into the body\n    - B: By using the body's cells to produce a viral protein\n    - C: By injecting antibodies directly into the bloodstream\n    - D: By suppressing the immune system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a key advantage of the mRNA vaccine over traditional vaccines?\n    - A: It contains live viral particles\n    - B: It contains weakened viral particles\n    - C: It does not contain any viral particles\n    - D: It requires multiple doses to be effective\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) What is a potential benefit of using the mRNA vaccine platform to develop vaccines for other diseases?\n    - A: It would increase the time it takes to develop new vaccines\n    - B: It would decrease the safety of new vaccines\n    - C: It would allow for more efficient and rapid development of new vaccines\n    - D: It would only be effective against COVID-19\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How could the mRNA vaccine be used to protect against future COVID-19 infections?\n    - A: By providing a one-time cure for the disease\n    - B: By protecting against only the original strain of COVID-19\n    - C: By adapting the vaccine to protect against new variants of COVID-19\n    - D: By suppressing the immune system\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is a significant advantage of the mRNA vaccine over traditional vaccines?\n    - A: It contains live viral particles\n    - B: It contains weakened viral particles\n    - C: It can trigger an immune response without causing infection\n    - D: It requires multiple doses to be effective\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How do the components of the mRNA vaccine work together to ensure effective delivery?\n    - A: The lipids and sugars work together to break down the mRNA\n    - B: The lipids and sugars work together to deliver the mRNA effectively\n    - C: The lipids and sugars have no role in delivering the mRNA\n    - D: The lipids and sugars are only used to store the vaccine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) What could be a potential outcome of combining the mRNA vaccine platform with other technologies, such as gene editing?\n    - A: It could lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine\n    - B: It could lead to new treatments for diseases that were previously difficult to target\n    - C: It could only be used to treat COVID-19\n    - D: It could lead to a decrease in the safety of the vaccine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How could the mRNA vaccine's ability to be adapted to treat new diseases impact global health?\n    - A: It could lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of global health responses\n    - B: It could lead to a more efficient and effective global response to pandemics\n    - C: It could only be used to treat COVID-19\n    - D: It could lead to a decrease in the safety of global health responses\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) What should be done to ensure the safety and efficacy of the mRNA vaccine as it is used to treat new diseases?\n    - A: It should be widely distributed without testing\n    - B: It should be subject to rigorous testing and regulatory oversight\n    - C: It should only be used to treat COVID-19\n    - D: It should be discontinued due to potential risks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What should be considered when weighing the potential risks and benefits of the mRNA vaccine against traditional vaccines?\n    - A: Only the potential benefits of the mRNA vaccine\n    - B: Only the potential risks of the mRNA vaccine\n    - C: Both the potential risks and benefits of the mRNA vaccine, as well as those of traditional vaccines\n    - D: Neither the potential risks nor benefits of the mRNA vaccine\n[Correct answer]: C"
