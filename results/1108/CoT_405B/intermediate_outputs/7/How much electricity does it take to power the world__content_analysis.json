    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge** (Recall of specific facts or details):\n\n1. A joule is a unit of energy.\n2. Watts measure energy per second.\n3. One joule per second equals one watt.\n4. It takes about 0.1 watts to power a smartphone, 1,000 watts to power a house, 1 million watts for a small town, and 1 billion watts for a mid-size city.\n5. As of 2020, it takes 3 trillion watts to power the entire world.\n6. Almost a billion people donâ€™t have access to reliable electricity.\n7. Electricity demand is expected to increase by 80% by 2050.\n8. Only one-third of the electricity generated comes from clean sources.\n9. Nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to generate carbon-free electricity.\n\n**Comprehension** (Understanding and interpretation of important concepts):\n\n1. The process of generating electricity from coal burning in a furnace to powering homes.\n2. The concept of measuring electricity in watts and its relation to joules.\n3. The impact of industrialization and population growth on electricity demand.\n4. The need to switch from fossil fuels to electric power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n5. The importance of clean energy sources in meeting future electricity needs.\n\n**Application** (Real-world scenarios or applications):\n\n1. Electrifying cars, buildings, and industrial processes to reduce fossil fuel consumption.\n2. Using wind and solar power in suitable locations to generate clean energy.\n3. Implementing nuclear power plants as a carbon-free electricity source.\n4. Developing energy storage solutions, such as batteries, to store excess energy from renewable sources.\n5. Improving power grid infrastructure to transport clean energy over long distances.\n\n**Analysis** (Relationships, contrasts, or cause-and-effect connections):\n\n1. The relationship between electricity demand and industrialization/population growth.\n2. The contrast between fossil fuels and clean energy sources in terms of environmental impact.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.\n4. The trade-offs between different clean energy sources (e.g., wind, solar, nuclear) in terms of cost, convenience, and environmental impact.\n5. The potential breakthroughs in nuclear fusion, fission, solar, and wind technologies and their impact on the energy landscape.\n\n**Synthesis** (Combining ideas to form new understanding):\n\n1. Integrating multiple clean energy sources to meet future electricity needs.\n2. Developing new technologies to improve energy storage and transportation.\n3. Creating policies and incentives to promote the adoption of clean energy sources.\n4. Encouraging international cooperation to address global energy challenges.\n5. Considering the social, economic, and environmental implications of different energy scenarios.\n\n**Evaluation** (Judgment, critique, or justification):\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of different clean energy sources in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n2. Assessing the economic viability of transitioning to clean energy sources.\n3. Justifying the need for investment in energy storage and grid infrastructure.\n4. Critiquing the environmental impact of different energy sources (e.g., nuclear waste disposal).\n5. Weighing the pros and cons of different energy scenarios and making informed decisions."
