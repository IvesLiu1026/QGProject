    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions as follows:\n\n1) What unique characteristics of feathers enable them to support birds in flight?\n    - A: They are extremely heavy and dense.\n    - B: They are very fragile and prone to breakage.\n    - C: They are strong, delicate, and lightweight.\n    - D: They are only found on the wings of birds.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which anatomical feature do birds share with certain dinosaurs?\n    - A: Hollow bones\n    - B: Wish bones\n    - C: Scales\n    - D: Fins\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) How can we better understand the evolution of feathers?\n    - A: By studying the family tree of mammals\n    - B: By examining the family tree of dinosaurs and birds\n    - C: By researching the evolution of reptiles\n    - D: By analyzing the feathers of modern fish\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What were the likely functions of intermediate forms of feathers, such as half-feathers?\n    - A: Only for flight\n    - B: Only for insulation\n    - C: For purposes other than flight, such as insulation, display, or camouflage\n    - D: For no specific function\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) (Removed, as it is not directly related to the transcript)\n\n6) (Removed, as it is not directly related to the transcript)\n\n7) What is the relationship between the structure of feathers and their function?\n    - A: The structure of feathers has no impact on their function.\n    - B: The structure of feathers is only important for insulation, not flight or display.\n    - C: The structure of feathers is closely related to their function in flight, insulation, and display.\n    - D: The structure of feathers is only important for display, not flight or insulation.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How did the feathers on dinosaurs change over time?\n    - A: They remained sparse patches of fuzz\n    - B: They immediately developed into dense plumage\n    - C: They evolved from sparse patches of fuzz to dense plumage\n    - D: They disappeared over time\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) (Removed, as it is not directly related to the transcript)\n\n10) (Removed, as it is not directly related to the transcript)\n\n11) What is the significance of the discovery of feathered dinosaurs for our understanding of evolution?\n    - A: It provides evidence against the theory of evolution\n    - B: It provides evidence for the evolution of mammals\n    - C: It provides evidence for the connection between dinosaurs and birds\n    - D: It provides evidence for the evolution of reptiles\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is it essential to consider alternative functions and explanations for the evolution of feathers?\n    - A: Because feathers evolved solely for the purpose of flight\n    - B: Because feathers have no other functions besides flight\n    - C: Because it allows us to develop a more nuanced understanding of the evolution of feathers\n    - D: Because it is not important to consider alternative explanations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 5, 6, 9, and 10, as they were not directly related to the transcript. The remaining questions were refined to improve clarity and conciseness, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect."
