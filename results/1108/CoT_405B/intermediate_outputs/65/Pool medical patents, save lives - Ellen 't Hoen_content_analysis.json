The Wright brothers developed the airplane and held patents on essential parts.\n2. In 2002, a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane and its relevance to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n3. Nelson Otwoma, a Kenyan social scientist, discovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment in 2002.\n4. The prices for ARVs (antiretroviral drugs) were around $12,000 per patient per year in 2002.\n5. Indian pharmaceutical companies started producing generic versions of ARVs, reducing the price to $350 per patient per year.\n6. Today, the same triple pill cocktail is available for $60 per patient per year.\n7. The World Trade Organization's intellectual property rules require countries to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years.\n8. The Medicines Patent Pool was established in 2010 to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The development of the airplane and the subsequent patent wars hindered the growth of the aviation industry.\n2. The U.S. government intervened and forced patent holders to make their patents available to others.\n3. The HIV/AIDS epidemic was exacerbated by the high cost of ARVs, making treatment inaccessible to many people in developing countries.\n4. The production of generic versions of ARVs by Indian pharmaceutical companies increased access to treatment for people in developing countries.\n5. The Medicines Patent Pool works by licensing patents from pharmaceutical companies and making them available to generic manufacturers.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. The concept of patent pools can be applied to other industries, such as the pharmaceutical industry, to increase access to essential products.\n2. The Medicines Patent Pool can be used as a model to address other global health crises.\n3. Pharmaceutical companies can choose to license their patents to the Medicines Patent Pool, allowing generic manufacturers to produce low-cost versions of their medicines.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between patent holders and generic manufacturers can be adversarial, leading to patent wars and limiting access to essential products.\n2. The U.S. government's intervention in the aviation industry can be compared to the need for government intervention in the pharmaceutical industry to ensure access to essential medicines.\n3. The impact of the Medicines Patent Pool on the HIV/AIDS epidemic can be analyzed in terms of increased access to treatment and the reduction of new infections.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The concept of patent pools can be combined with other strategies, such as tiered pricing and voluntary licensing, to increase access to essential medicines.\n2. The Medicines Patent Pool can be seen as a step towards a more collaborative approach to addressing global health crises, where pharmaceutical companies work together with generic manufacturers and governments to ensure access to essential medicines.\n3. The success of the Medicines Patent Pool can be used as a model to address other global health challenges, such as tuberculosis and malaria.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The effectiveness of the Medicines Patent Pool in increasing access to ARVs can be evaluated in terms of the number of people receiving treatment and the reduction of new infections.\n2. The impact of the World Trade Organization's intellectual property rules on access to essential medicines can be evaluated in terms of the limitations they place on generic manufacturers.\n3. The decision of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents to the Medicines Patent Pool can be evaluated in terms of their commitment to increasing access to essential medicines and their willingness to collaborate with generic manufacturers."
