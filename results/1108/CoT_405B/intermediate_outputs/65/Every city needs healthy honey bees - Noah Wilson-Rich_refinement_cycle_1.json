    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to enhance clarity, conciseness, and accuracy. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD)?\n    - A: A disease that kills honeybees instantly\n    - B: A phenomenon where honeybees disappear without leaving dead bodies\n    - C: A type of parasite that affects honeybees\n    - D: A decline in honey production\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the veroa mite?\n    - A: A type of honeybee\n    - B: A parasite that affects honeybees and has spread globally\n    - C: A disease that affects honeybees\n    - D: A type of pesticide\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the speaker's goal regarding the audience's perspective on honeybees?\n    - A: To increase fear of honeybees\n    - B: To promote the use of pesticides\n    - C: To change the audience's perspective from fear to appreciation\n    - D: To encourage the destruction of honeybee habitats\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the impact of habitat loss and pesticide use on honeybee populations?\n    - A: It increases their populations\n    - B: It has no effect on their populations\n    - C: It decreases their populations\n    - D: It only affects their honey production\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What can be a solution to the decline of honeybee populations?\n    - A: Urban beekeeping\n    - B: Destroying honeybee habitats\n    - C: Using more pesticides\n    - D: Reducing green spaces in cities\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What can provide habitat for honeybees in urban areas?\n    - A: Green roofs and urban gardens\n    - B: Parking lots and skyscrapers\n    - C: Highways and industrial areas\n    - D: Only rural areas\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between honeybee health and human health?\n    - A: They are unrelated\n    - B: Honeybee health only affects agriculture\n    - C: Honeybee health is linked to human health, including the impact of pesticides and habitat loss\n    - D: Honeybee health only affects the economy\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the comparison between urban and rural environments and their effects on honeybee populations?\n    - A: Urban environments are always worse for honeybees\n    - B: Rural environments are always better for honeybees\n    - C: Urban environments can be beneficial for honeybees, while rural environments can be challenging\n    - D: There is no difference between the two\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be a way to promote environmental awareness and honeybee conservation?\n    - A: Integrating honeybee education into school curricula\n    - B: Destroying honeybee habitats\n    - C: Using more pesticides\n    - D: Reducing green spaces in cities\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can be a way to improve honeybee health?\n    - A: Developing new technologies, such as oral vaccines and probiotics\n    - B: Using more pesticides\n    - C: Reducing green spaces in cities\n    - D: Only relying on traditional methods\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is the effectiveness of urban beekeeping in addressing honeybee decline?\n    - A: It is completely ineffective\n    - B: It is somewhat effective, but more research is needed\n    - C: It is very effective and should be widely implemented\n    - D: It is only effective in rural areas\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the impact of pesticide use on honeybee populations?\n    - A: It has no effect\n    - B: It is beneficial for honeybees\n    - C: It is detrimental to honeybee populations\n    - D: It only affects their honey production\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 to enhance clarity and conciseness. I also ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
