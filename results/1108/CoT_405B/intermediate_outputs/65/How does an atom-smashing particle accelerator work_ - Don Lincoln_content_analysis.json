The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has a circumference of about 18 miles.\n2. The LHC can heat matter to temperatures last seen at a trillionth of a second after the universe began.\n3. The beam-containing region of the LHC is a vacuum with lower pressure than what surrounds the international space station.\n4. The temperature of the LHC is 456 degrees Fahrenheit below zero.\n5. A previous accelerator holds the world record for velocity, accelerating an electron to a speed close to the speed of light.\n6. Photons travel at approximately 186,000 miles per second.\n7. Electric fields are used to make charged particles move in particle accelerators.\n8. Magnetic fields make charged particles move in a circular path.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. An atom smasher, or particle accelerator, is a device that collides atomic nuclei together at extremely high energy.\n2. Particle accelerators work by using electric fields to make charged particles move, and magnetic fields to guide them in a circular path.\n3. The strength of the magnets and the radius of the circular path determine the maximum energy of the beam.\n4. High-energy accelerators consist of a short region with accelerating electric fields, combined with a long series of magnets.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. Particle accelerators can be used to study the fundamental rules that govern matter.\n2. The technology used in particle accelerators can be applied to other fields, such as engineering and materials science.\n3. The principles of electric and magnetic fields used in particle accelerators can be applied to other areas, such as electronics and transportation.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The relationship between electric fields and charged particles is similar to the relationship between gravity and objects with mass.\n2. The use of magnetic fields to guide particles in a circular path allows for more efficient acceleration.\n3. The design of modern particle accelerators, such as the LHC, is a result of the limitations of earlier designs.\n4. The energy achieved by particle accelerators is dependent on the strength of the magnets and the radius of the circular path.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. Combining electric and magnetic fields in a particle accelerator allows for the creation of high-energy beams.\n2. The use of particle accelerators to study subatomic particles can lead to new insights into the fundamental nature of matter.\n3. The technology developed for particle accelerators can be combined with other technologies to create new applications.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. The design of the LHC can be evaluated in terms of its effectiveness in achieving high-energy collisions.\n2. The use of particle accelerators to study subatomic particles can be justified in terms of the potential benefits to our understanding of the universe.\n3. The cost and complexity of building and operating particle accelerators can be evaluated in terms of their potential benefits to science and society.\n4. The ethics of using particle accelerators to create high-energy collisions can be debated in terms of potential risks and benefits."
