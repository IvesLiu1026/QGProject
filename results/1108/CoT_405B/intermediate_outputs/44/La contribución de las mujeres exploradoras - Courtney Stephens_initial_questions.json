    "initial_questions": "Unfortunately, I cannot generate multiple-choice questions without the provided transcript for analysis. However, I can demonstrate how to create multiple-choice questions across the six Bloom's Taxonomy levels using a hypothetical topic.\n\nLet's assume the topic is climate change. Here are two sample multiple-choice questions for each level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n1) What is the primary cause of global warming?\n    - A: Burning fossil fuels\n    - B: Deforestation\n    - C: Pollution in oceans\n    - D: Melting glaciers\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Which of the following greenhouse gases is most prevalent in the Earth's atmosphere?\n    - A: Carbon dioxide\n    - B: Methane\n    - C: Nitrous oxide\n    - D: Ozone\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Comprehension**\n1) What is the main effect of rising global temperatures on polar ice caps?\n    - A: Increased ice formation\n    - B: No significant impact\n    - C: Melting of ice sheets\n    - D: Shift in Earth's axis\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which of the following best describes the relationship between climate change and extreme weather events?\n    - A: Climate change causes all extreme weather events\n    - B: Climate change has no impact on extreme weather events\n    - C: Climate change increases the likelihood of extreme weather events\n    - D: Climate change only affects temperature-related events\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application**\n1) A company wants to reduce its carbon footprint by 20% in the next year. Which of the following actions would be most effective?\n    - A: Implementing a recycling program\n    - B: Increasing energy-efficient lighting\n    - C: Switching to renewable energy sources\n    - D: Reducing water usage\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) A city is planning to build a new transportation system. Which of the following options would be most beneficial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions?\n    - A: Building a highway system\n    - B: Implementing a public bus system\n    - C: Creating a bike-sharing program\n    - D: Investing in electric vehicle infrastructure\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the primary difference between climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies?\n    - A: Mitigation focuses on reducing emissions, while adaptation focuses on preparing for climate change impacts\n    - B: Mitigation focuses on preparing for climate change impacts, while adaptation focuses on reducing emissions\n    - C: Mitigation and adaptation are interchangeable terms\n    - D: Mitigation is a short-term strategy, while adaptation is a long-term strategy\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Which of the following is an example of a climate change feedback loop?\n    - A: Melting Arctic ice reduces global temperatures\n    - B: Increased CO2 levels lead to more plant growth, which absorbs CO2\n    - C: Thawing permafrost releases methane, which accelerates global warming\n    - D: Rising temperatures cause more frequent hurricanes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) Which of the following combinations of strategies would be most effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture?\n    - A: Implementing regenerative agriculture practices and reducing synthetic fertilizer use\n    - B: Increasing crop yields and implementing conservation tillage\n    - C: Promoting agroforestry and reducing livestock production\n    - D: Implementing precision agriculture and increasing irrigation efficiency\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What would be the potential benefits of integrating climate change education into school curricula?\n    - A: Increased awareness of climate change impacts and mitigation strategies\n    - B: Improved critical thinking and problem-solving skills\n    - C: Enhanced environmental literacy and civic engagement\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) Which of the following statements about climate change is most accurate?\n    - A: Climate change is a natural phenomenon that has no significant impact on human societies\n    - B: Climate change is primarily caused by human activities and requires immediate attention\n    - C: Climate change is a distant threat that can be addressed in the future\n    - D: Climate change is a local issue that only affects certain regions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the most significant limitation of relying solely on renewable energy sources to address climate change?\n    - A: High upfront costs\n    - B: Intermittent energy supply\n    - C: Limited scalability\n    - D: Dependence on non-renewable resources for manufacturing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nPlease provide the actual transcript, and I'll be happy to assist you in creating multiple-choice questions tailored to the content."
