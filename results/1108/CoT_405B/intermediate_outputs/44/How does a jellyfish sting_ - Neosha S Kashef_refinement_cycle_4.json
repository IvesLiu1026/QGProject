    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of a jellyfish's body is composed of water?\n    - A: 70%\n    - B: 80%\n    - C: 90%\n    - D: 95%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) Which species of jellyfish has the longest tentacles, extending over 100 feet?\n    - A: Indo-Pacific box jelly\n    - B: Lion's mane\n    - C: Sea nettle\n    - D: Moon jellyfish\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of cnidocytes in jellyfish?\n    - A: To aid in digestion and nutrient absorption\n    - B: To facilitate movement and locomotion\n    - C: To regulate body temperature and osmotic balance\n    - D: To capture prey and defend against predators\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What is the typical outcome of most jellyfish stings on humans?\n    - A: They can cause severe allergic reactions\n    - B: They are usually fatal\n    - C: They are just painful nuisances\n    - D: They have no effect on humans\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is the recommended treatment to prevent further harm after a jellyfish sting?\n    - A: Rinse the affected area with fresh water\n    - B: Apply heat to the affected area\n    - C: Rinse the affected area with vinegar\n    - D: Use a topical antibiotic ointment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential benefit of studying the adaptations of predators that eat jellyfish?\n    - A: Informing the development of new materials or technologies\n    - B: Discovering new species of jellyfish\n    - C: Improving our understanding of the marine ecosystem\n    - D: Providing insights into the evolution of jellyfish\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How do the stinging cells of jellyfish eject venom?\n    - A: Through a complex process involving multiple steps\n    - B: Through a nematocyst that fires under high osmotic pressure\n    - C: Through a process that is still not fully understood\n    - D: Through a process that involves the use of muscles\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a key difference between the venom of the Indo-Pacific box jelly and other species of jellyfish?\n    - A: The venom of the Indo-Pacific box jelly is less potent than other species\n    - B: The venom of the Indo-Pacific box jelly is more potent than other species\n    - C: The venom of the Indo-Pacific box jelly is the same as other species\n    - D: The venom of the Indo-Pacific box jelly is still not fully understood\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a potential benefit of combining the knowledge of jellyfish stinging cells with medical technology?\n    - A: Developing new treatments for jellyfish stings\n    - B: Developing new painkillers\n    - C: Developing new treatments for cancer\n    - D: Developing new methods for delivering medicine\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is a potential application of using jellyfish venom in medical treatments?\n    - A: Developing new painkillers\n    - B: Developing new treatments for cancer\n    - C: Developing new treatments for heart conditions\n    - D: Developing new methods for delivering medicine\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) Why should you not use fresh water to rinse a jellyfish sting?\n    - A: Because it can cause an allergic reaction\n    - B: Because it can activate the nematocysts and cause further harm\n    - C: Because it can reduce the effectiveness of the venom\n    - D: Because it can increase the risk of infection\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What unique adaptation allows some predators to eat jellyfish without getting stung?\n    - A: Thick skin that protects them from the stinging cells\n    - B: Specialized digestive enzymes that break down the venom\n    - C: Ability to avoid touching the jellyfish's tentacles\n    - D: Presence of antibodies that neutralize the venom\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
