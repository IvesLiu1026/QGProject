    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level based on the provided content analysis:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What percentage of a jellyfish's body is made up of water?\n    - A: 50%\n    - B: 75%\n    - C: 95%\n    - D: 99%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the name of the largest species of jellyfish, known for its tentacles that can extend over 100 feet?\n    - A: Indo-Pacific box jelly\n    - B: Lion's mane\n    - C: Sea wasp\n    - D: Ocean sunfish\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) Why do jellyfish rely on their stinging cells for protection and prey capture?\n    - A: Because they are apex predators in the ocean\n    - B: Because their delicate bodies require additional defense mechanisms\n    - C: Because they are slow swimmers and need to capture prey quickly\n    - D: Because they have poor eyesight and need to rely on other senses\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary function of the nematocyst discharge process in jellyfish?\n    - A: To move through the water\n    - B: To capture prey\n    - C: To defend against predators\n    - D: To regulate body temperature\n[Correct answer]: B and C (both are correct, but for the purpose of this question, B is the correct answer)\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) If you are stung by a jellyfish, what is the recommended course of action to alleviate the pain?\n    - A: Rinse the affected area with fresh water\n    - B: Remove lingering tentacles stuck to the skin and rinse with vinegar or seawater\n    - C: Apply heat to the affected area\n    - D: Take a pain reliever and wait for the pain to subside\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the necessary response in the event of an Indo-Pacific box jelly sting?\n    - A: Administer anti-venom immediately\n    - B: Rinse the affected area with vinegar or seawater\n    - C: Remove lingering tentacles stuck to the skin\n    - D: Wait for medical help to arrive\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the structure of a jellyfish and its ability to sting?\n    - A: The structure of a jellyfish makes it vulnerable to predators\n    - B: The structure of a jellyfish allows it to capture prey quickly\n    - C: The structure of a jellyfish is crucial for its survival, as it enables the jellyfish to sting\n    - D: The structure of a jellyfish has no relation to its ability to sting\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is an example of evolutionary adaptation in jellyfish?\n    - A: The development of powerful swimming abilities\n    - B: The growth of sharp teeth for capturing prey\n    - C: The contrast between the delicate body of a jellyfish and its powerful stinging cells\n    - D: The ability to change color for camouflage\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How could the unique characteristics of jellyfish stinging cells be applied in the field of medicine?\n    - A: By developing new methods for delivering treatments using cnidocytes\n    - B: By studying the venom of jellyfish to understand its potential applications\n    - C: By exploring the use of jellyfish as a food source\n    - D: By investigating the potential of jellyfish as a source of renewable energy\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What could be a potential outcome of studying jellyfish biology and their interactions with other marine species?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the complex relationships within ecosystems\n    - B: The development of new methods for capturing jellyfish\n    - C: The discovery of new species of jellyfish\n    - D: A greater understanding of the impact of human activities on jellyfish populations\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) What is a potential risk of using cnidocytes to deliver medicine?\n    - A: The risk of triggering an allergic reaction in patients\n    - B: The risk of the cnidocytes not being effective in delivering the treatment\n    - C: The risk of the treatment being too expensive for widespread use\n    - D: The risk of the cnidocytes causing unintended harm to the patient\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is a potential benefit of using jellyfish venom for medical purposes?\n    - A: The venom could be used to develop new painkillers\n    - B: The venom could be used to develop new treatments for diseases\n    - C: The venom could be used to develop new methods for delivering treatments\n    - D: The venom could be used to develop new diagnostic tools\n[Correct answer]: B"
