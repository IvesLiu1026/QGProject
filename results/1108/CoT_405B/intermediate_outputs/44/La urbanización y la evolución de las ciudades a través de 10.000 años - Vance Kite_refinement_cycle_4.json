However, I can review the initial questions for clarity, conciseness, plausible distractors, and accurate correct answers.\n\nUpon reviewing the questions, I noticed that most of them are well-written and align with the general topic of renewable energy. However, without the transcript, it's challenging to confirm whether each question aligns with the specific key concepts discussed.\n\nHere are the refined questions with minor adjustments for clarity and conciseness:\n\n1) What percentage of the world's energy is currently generated from renewable sources?\n    - A: 5%\n    - B: 20%\n    - C: 40%\n    - D: 60%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which energy source is NOT considered renewable?\n    - A: Geothermal\n    - B: Biomass\n    - C: Nuclear\n    - D: Hydroelectric\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary environmental advantage of using renewable energy sources?\n    - A: Reduced greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: Increased energy independence\n    - C: Improved air quality\n    - D: Enhanced energy security\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is the concept of sustainability in the context of renewable energy?\n    - A: Meeting the energy needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\n    - B: Reducing energy consumption to minimize environmental impact\n    - C: Increasing energy production to meet growing demand\n    - D: Focusing on short-term energy solutions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) Which option would be the most environmentally friendly for a company investing in a new energy source?\n    - A: Building a new natural gas-fired power plant\n    - B: Installing solar panels on the facility's roof\n    - C: Purchasing energy from a nearby nuclear power plant\n    - D: Drilling for oil on the facility's property\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) Which action would be the most effective for a homeowner looking to reduce their energy bills and carbon footprint?\n    - A: Upgrading to energy-efficient appliances\n    - B: Installing a programmable thermostat\n    - C: Investing in a solar water heater\n    - D: Adding insulation to the attic\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the primary difference between a renewable energy source and a non-renewable energy source?\n    - A: The amount of energy produced\n    - B: The cost of production\n    - C: The environmental impact\n    - D: The availability and replenishment of the resource\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What are potential drawbacks of relying on renewable energy sources? (Select all that apply)\n    - A: Intermittent energy supply\n    - B: High upfront costs\n    - C: Limited geographical suitability\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) How can governments and businesses work together to promote the adoption of renewable energy sources?\n    - A: By providing tax incentives for renewable energy investments\n    - B: By implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: By investing in renewable energy research and development\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What role can individuals play in promoting the use of renewable energy sources?\n    - A: By reducing their energy consumption\n    - B: By investing in renewable energy technologies\n    - C: By advocating for renewable energy policies\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is the most significant advantage of investing in renewable energy sources?\n    - A: Reduced energy costs\n    - B: Increased energy independence\n    - C: Mitigating climate change\n    - D: Creating jobs in the renewable energy sector\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How can the benefits of renewable energy be balanced against the potential drawbacks?\n    - A: By prioritizing economic growth over environmental concerns\n    - B: By investing in research and development to improve renewable energy technologies\n    - C: By implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\n    - D: By considering the long-term benefits and trade-offs of renewable energy\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nWithout the transcript, I couldn't make significant changes. If you provide the transcript and further feedback, I can refine the questions more accurately."
