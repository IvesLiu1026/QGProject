    "refinement_output": "Based on the initial set of questions and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary greenhouse gas responsible for global warming?\n    - A: Carbon dioxide\n    - B: Methane\n    - C: Ozone\n    - D: Nitrous oxide\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the name of the international agreement aimed at mitigating climate change, adopted in 2015?\n    - A: The Kyoto Protocol\n    - B: The Paris Agreement\n    - C: The Copenhagen Accord\n    - D: The Montreal Protocol\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary cause of climate change?\n    - A: Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and land use changes\n    - B: Natural fluctuations in Earth's temperature\n    - C: Changes in the Earth's orbit\n    - D: Volcanic eruptions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is the expected outcome of climate change if left unchecked?\n    - A: A decrease in global temperatures\n    - B: An increase in global temperatures, leading to more extreme weather events\n    - C: No significant change in global temperatures\n    - D: A decrease in sea levels\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A company is considering investing in renewable energy sources to reduce its carbon footprint. What would be the most effective way to achieve this goal?\n    - A: Investing in carbon capture and storage technology\n    - B: Building a new coal-fired power plant\n    - C: Installing solar panels and wind turbines\n    - D: Implementing energy-efficient lighting\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) A city is experiencing frequent flooding due to rising sea levels. What would be an effective adaptation strategy?\n    - A: Building a sea wall to protect the city\n    - B: Implementing a flood insurance program\n    - C: Relocating residents to higher ground\n    - D: Investing in flood-resistant construction materials\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between climate change and extreme weather events?\n    - A: Climate change causes a decrease in extreme weather events\n    - B: Climate change has no impact on extreme weather events\n    - C: Climate change causes an increase in extreme weather events\n    - D: The relationship between climate change and extreme weather events is unclear\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the impact of climate change on global food systems?\n    - A: Climate change will lead to an increase in crop yields and food security\n    - B: Climate change will have no impact on global food systems\n    - C: Climate change will lead to a decrease in crop yields and food security\n    - D: The impact of climate change on global food systems is unclear\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can climate change mitigation efforts be integrated into urban planning to create more sustainable cities?\n    - A: By investing in green infrastructure and promoting public transportation\n    - B: By increasing the use of fossil fuels and reducing energy efficiency\n    - C: By implementing a carbon tax and reducing public transportation\n    - D: By promoting suburbanization and reducing urban density\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What are the potential benefits of combining climate change mitigation efforts with sustainable development goals?\n    - A: Reduced economic growth and increased poverty\n    - B: Increased economic growth and reduced poverty\n    - C: No significant impact on economic growth or poverty\n    - D: Reduced economic growth and reduced poverty\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the most effective way to evaluate the success of climate change mitigation efforts?\n    - A: By measuring the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: By measuring the increase in global temperatures\n    - C: By measuring the economic costs of mitigation efforts\n    - D: By measuring the public perception of climate change\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is a significant limitation of the current international climate change framework?\n    - A: The lack of binding emissions targets for developed countries\n    - B: The lack of participation from developing countries\n    - C: The lack of funding for climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts\n    - D: The lack of public awareness and engagement on climate change issues\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nChanges made:\n\n- Minor rewording for clarity and concision\n- Emphasized human activities as the primary cause of climate change in question 3\n- Changed question 12 to \"a significant limitation\" to make the question more accurate and nuanced.\n\nNo major changes were necessary, as the initial questions were well-aligned with the key concepts and had plausible distractors."
