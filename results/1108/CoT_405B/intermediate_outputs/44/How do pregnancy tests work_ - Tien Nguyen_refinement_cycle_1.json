    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In what year was the earliest known pregnancy test recorded?\n    - A: 1000 BC\n    - B: 1350 BC\n    - C: 1500 AD\n    - D: 1963 AD\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What hormone do modern pregnancy tests detect to determine pregnancy?\n    - A: Estrogen\n    - B: Progesterone\n    - C: Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)\n    - D: Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the principle behind the ancient Egyptian pregnancy test?\n    - A: Detecting HCG in urine\n    - B: Measuring estrogen levels in blood\n    - C: Observing seed growth promoted by estrogen in urine\n    - D: Analyzing the color of urine\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the purpose of the control zone in a modern pregnancy test?\n    - A: To detect HCG levels\n    - B: To confirm the test is working properly\n    - C: To predict the sex of the baby\n    - D: To measure estrogen levels\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) In what situation might the ancient Egyptian pregnancy test be useful?\n    - A: In a hospital setting with modern equipment\n    - B: In a resource-poor setting with limited access to medical facilities\n    - C: For detecting ectopic pregnancies\n    - D: For monitoring HCG levels in IVF treatment\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential use of modern pregnancy tests beyond detecting pregnancy?\n    - A: Detecting certain types of cancer\n    - B: Monitoring blood sugar levels\n    - C: Measuring blood pressure\n    - D: Analyzing urine for infection\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What factors can affect the accuracy of the modern pregnancy test?\n    - A: Time of day and presence of other substances in the urine\n    - B: Only time of day\n    - C: Only presence of other substances in the urine\n    - D: Neither time of day nor presence of other substances in the urine\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What can influence the results of a modern pregnancy test?\n    - A: IVF injections and certain types of cancer\n    - B: Only IVF injections\n    - C: Only certain types of cancer\n    - D: Neither IVF injections nor certain types of cancer\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What can be gained by studying the ancient Egyptian pregnancy test in relation to modern pregnancy tests?\n    - A: A more accurate method for detecting pregnancy\n    - B: A more comprehensive understanding of the biology of pregnancy\n    - C: A simpler method for detecting pregnancy\n    - D: A more expensive method for detecting pregnancy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a potential application of the sandwich assay used in pregnancy tests?\n    - A: Cancer detection\n    - B: Infectious disease diagnosis\n    - C: Genetic disorder screening\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) How can the accuracy of the ancient Egyptian pregnancy test be evaluated?\n    - A: By comparing it to modern pregnancy tests\n    - B: By testing it on a large population\n    - C: By analyzing its ability to detect HCG levels\n    - D: By evaluating its cost-effectiveness\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What are important aspects to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of a pregnancy test?\n    - A: Sensitivity and specificity\n    - B: Cost and availability\n    - C: Ease of use and interpretation\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made some minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and concision, but overall, the initial questions were well-written and aligned with the key concepts in the transcript."
