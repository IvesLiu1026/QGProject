Which of the following strategies is most likely to achieve this goal?\n    - A: Implementing energy-efficient lighting and HVAC systems\n    - B: Encouraging employees to carpool to work and use public transportation\n    - C: Investing in renewable energy sources\n    - D: Reducing the number of employees\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make option B more comprehensive.\n\n6) A city is experiencing frequent flooding due to rising sea levels. Which of the following measures is most likely to mitigate this issue?\n    - A: Building a seawall to protect the city\n    - B: Implementing a flood-control system and upgrading drainage infrastructure\n    - C: Relocating residents to higher ground\n    - D: Increasing the city's water storage capacity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make option B more comprehensive.\n\n7) What is the relationship between climate change and extreme weather events?\n    - A: Climate change causes extreme weather events\n    - B: Extreme weather events cause climate change\n    - C: Climate change and extreme weather events are unrelated\n    - D: Climate change exacerbates extreme weather events\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) Which of the following factors contributes to the increase in global temperatures?\n    - A: Increase in solar radiation\n    - B: Decrease in volcanic eruptions\n    - C: Increase in greenhouse gas emissions\n    - D: Changes in ocean currents\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make option D more plausible.\n\n9) How can climate change mitigation efforts be integrated into urban planning?\n    - A: By building more roads and highways\n    - B: By increasing the number of parks and green spaces\n    - C: By implementing energy-efficient building codes, promoting public transportation, and encouraging mixed-use development\n    - D: By reducing the number of buildings and infrastructure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make option C more comprehensive.\n\n10) What is a potential benefit of transitioning to a low-carbon economy?\n    - A: Increased reliance on fossil fuels\n    - B: Decreased economic growth\n    - C: Improved public health and reduced healthcare costs\n    - D: Increased energy costs in the short term\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make option D more plausible.\n\n11) What is the most effective way to address climate change?\n    - A: Implementing a carbon tax\n    - B: Investing in renewable energy sources\n    - C: Promoting sustainable land use practices\n    - D: A combination of the above measures\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined for clarity and conciseness.\n\n12) Which of the following climate change policies is most likely to be effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions?\n    - A: Cap-and-trade system\n    - B: Carbon tax\n    - C: Renewable portfolio standard\n    - D: A combination of the above policies\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined to reflect that a combination of policies is likely to be more effective."
