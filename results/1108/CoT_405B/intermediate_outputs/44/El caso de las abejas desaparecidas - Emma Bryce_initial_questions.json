However, I can provide you with a general template and example questions based on a fictional transcript.\n\nLet's assume a transcript about climate change and its effects on the environment.\n\n**Knowledge**\n1) What is the primary cause of global warming?\n    - A: Burning of fossil fuels\n    - B: Deforestation\n    - C: Pollution in oceans\n    - D: Overpopulation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Which of the following gases is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect?\n    - A: Oxygen\n    - B: Carbon dioxide\n    - C: Nitrogen\n    - D: Helium\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension**\n1) What is the primary effect of rising sea levels due to climate change?\n    - A: Increased risk of droughts\n    - B: More frequent earthquakes\n    - C: Loss of coastal ecosystems and habitats\n    - D: Decreased risk of floods\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How does climate change impact global food production?\n    - A: Increased crop yields due to warmer temperatures\n    - B: Decreased crop yields due to changing weather patterns\n    - C: No significant impact on food production\n    - D: Increased risk of pests and diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n1) A company wants to reduce its carbon footprint by switching to renewable energy sources. Which of the following options would be the most effective?\n    - A: Building a new coal-fired power plant\n    - B: Investing in solar panels and wind turbines\n    - C: Implementing energy-efficient lighting\n    - D: Reducing employee travel\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A community is experiencing frequent flooding due to rising sea levels. What would be an effective adaptation strategy?\n    - A: Building a seawall to protect against floods\n    - B: Relocating residents to higher ground\n    - C: Implementing flood-control measures such as levees\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the relationship between climate change and extreme weather events?\n    - A: Climate change causes a decrease in extreme weather events\n    - B: Climate change has no impact on extreme weather events\n    - C: Climate change contributes to an increase in extreme weather events\n    - D: The relationship is unclear\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How does climate change affect global biodiversity?\n    - A: Climate change leads to an increase in species populations\n    - B: Climate change has no impact on global biodiversity\n    - C: Climate change contributes to a decline in species populations\n    - D: The impact is unknown\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) What would be a potential consequence of combining climate change mitigation efforts with sustainable development strategies?\n    - A: Reduced economic growth\n    - B: Increased greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: Improved public health and economic benefits\n    - D: Decreased global cooperation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How could climate change adaptation strategies be integrated into urban planning to create more resilient cities?\n    - A: By ignoring climate change projections\n    - B: By incorporating green infrastructure and climate-resilient design\n    - C: By relocating cities to higher ground\n    - D: By reducing urban populations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) What is the most effective way to address climate change, and why?\n    - A: Implementing a global carbon tax\n    - B: Investing in renewable energy sources\n    - C: Promoting sustainable land use practices\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D (Note: This question requires justification and evaluation of different options)\n\n2) How can policymakers balance the need to address climate change with economic development goals?\n    - A: By prioritizing economic growth over climate change mitigation\n    - B: By implementing policies that promote sustainable development\n    - C: By ignoring climate change projections\n    - D: By reducing government spending on climate change initiatives\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nPlease provide the actual transcript, and I'll be happy to help you create accurate multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level."
