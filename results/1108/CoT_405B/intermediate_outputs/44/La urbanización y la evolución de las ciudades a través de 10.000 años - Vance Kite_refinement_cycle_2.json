    "refinement_output": "Unfortunately, I don't have the transcript and the further feedback to review. However, I can still refine the questions based on general knowledge and the initial set of questions provided.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary greenhouse gas responsible for global warming?\n    - A: Carbon dioxide\n    - B: Methane\n    - C: Ozone\n    - D: Nitrous oxide\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the name of the international agreement aimed at mitigating climate change, adopted in 2015?\n    - A: The Kyoto Protocol\n    - B: The Paris Agreement\n    - C: The Copenhagen Accord\n    - D: The Montreal Protocol\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the primary cause of climate change?\n    - A: Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and land use changes\n    - B: Natural fluctuations in Earth's temperature\n    - C: Changes in the Earth's orbit\n    - D: Volcanic eruptions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined question: What is the primary cause of current climate change?\n(This change clarifies that the question is referring to the current climate change phenomenon, rather than natural fluctuations in the Earth's temperature.)\n\n4) What is the expected outcome of climate change if left unchecked?\n    - A: A decrease in global temperatures\n    - B: An increase in global temperatures, leading to more extreme weather events\n    - C: No significant change in global temperatures\n    - D: A decrease in sea levels\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) A company is considering investing in renewable energy sources to reduce its carbon footprint. What would be the most effective way to achieve this goal?\n    - A: Investing in carbon capture and storage technology\n    - B: Building a new coal-fired power plant\n    - C: Installing solar panels and wind turbines\n    - D: Implementing energy-efficient lighting\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined question: What is the most effective way for a company to reduce its carbon footprint through renewable energy sources?\n(This change clarifies that the question is asking about renewable energy sources specifically.)\n\n6) A city is experiencing frequent flooding due to rising sea levels. What would be an effective adaptation strategy?\n    - A: Building a sea wall to protect the city\n    - B: Implementing a flood insurance program\n    - C: Relocating residents to higher ground\n    - D: Investing in flood-resistant construction materials\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between climate change and extreme weather events?\n    - A: Climate change causes a decrease in extreme weather events\n    - B: Climate change has no impact on extreme weather events\n    - C: Climate change causes an increase in extreme weather events\n    - D: The relationship between climate change and extreme weather events is unclear\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the impact of climate change on global food systems?\n    - A: Climate change will lead to an increase in crop yields and food security\n    - B: Climate change will have no impact on global food systems\n    - C: Climate change will lead to a decrease in crop yields and food security\n    - D: The impact of climate change on global food systems is unclear\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) How can climate change mitigation efforts be integrated into urban planning to create more sustainable cities?\n    - A: By investing in green infrastructure and promoting public transportation\n    - B: By increasing the use of fossil fuels and reducing energy efficiency\n    - C: By implementing a carbon tax and reducing public transportation\n    - D: By promoting suburbanization and reducing urban density\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What are the potential benefits of combining climate change mitigation efforts with sustainable development goals?\n    - A: Reduced economic growth and increased poverty\n    - B: Increased economic growth and reduced poverty\n    - C: No significant impact on economic growth or poverty\n    - D: Reduced economic growth and reduced poverty\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is the most effective way to evaluate the success of climate change mitigation efforts?\n    - A: By measuring the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: By measuring the increase in global temperatures\n    - C: By measuring the economic costs of mitigation efforts\n    - D: By measuring the public perception of climate change\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What is a significant limitation of the current international climate change framework?\n    - A: The lack of binding emissions targets for developed countries\n    - B: The lack of participation from developing countries\n    - C: The lack of funding for climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts\n    - D: The lack of public awareness and engagement on climate change issues\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined question: What is a significant limitation of the current international climate change framework in terms of emissions targets?\n(This change clarifies that the question is asking about emissions targets specifically.)\n\nWithout the transcript and further feedback, I couldn't refine the questions further."
