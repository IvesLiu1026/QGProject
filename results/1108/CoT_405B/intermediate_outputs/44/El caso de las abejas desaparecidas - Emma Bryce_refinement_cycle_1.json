The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. However, I made some minor adjustments to a few questions to enhance clarity and conciseness.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary cause of global warming?\n    - A: Burning of fossil fuels\n    - B: Deforestation\n    - C: Pollution in oceans\n    - D: Overpopulation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Which of the following gases is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect?\n    - A: Oxygen\n    - B: Carbon dioxide\n    - C: Nitrogen\n    - D: Helium\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary effect of rising sea levels due to climate change?\n    - A: Increased risk of droughts\n    - B: More frequent earthquakes\n    - C: Loss of coastal ecosystems and habitats\n    - D: Decreased risk of floods\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) How does climate change impact global food production?\n    - A: Increased crop yields due to warmer temperatures\n    - B: Decreased crop yields due to changing weather patterns\n    - C: No significant impact on food production\n    - D: Increased risk of pests and diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Which of the following options would be the most effective way for a company to reduce its carbon footprint?\n    - A: Building a new coal-fired power plant\n    - B: Investing in solar panels and wind turbines\n    - C: Implementing energy-efficient lighting\n    - D: Reducing employee travel\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What would be an effective adaptation strategy for a community experiencing frequent flooding due to rising sea levels?\n    - A: Building a seawall to protect against floods\n    - B: Relocating residents to higher ground\n    - C: Implementing flood-control measures such as levees\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the relationship between climate change and extreme weather events?\n    - A: Climate change causes a decrease in extreme weather events\n    - B: Climate change has no impact on extreme weather events\n    - C: Climate change contributes to an increase in extreme weather events\n    - D: The relationship is unclear\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How does climate change affect global biodiversity?\n    - A: Climate change leads to an increase in species populations\n    - B: Climate change has no impact on global biodiversity\n    - C: Climate change contributes to a decline in species populations\n    - D: The impact is unknown\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What would be a potential consequence of combining climate change mitigation efforts with sustainable development strategies?\n    - A: Reduced economic growth\n    - B: Increased greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: Improved public health and economic benefits\n    - D: Decreased global cooperation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How could climate change adaptation strategies be integrated into urban planning to create more resilient cities?\n    - A: By ignoring climate change projections\n    - B: By incorporating green infrastructure and climate-resilient design\n    - C: By relocating cities to higher ground\n    - D: By reducing urban populations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the most effective way to address climate change?\n    - A: Implementing a global carbon tax\n    - B: Investing in renewable energy sources\n    - C: Promoting sustainable land use practices\n    - D: A combination of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) How can policymakers balance the need to address climate change with economic development goals?\n    - A: By prioritizing economic growth over climate change mitigation\n    - B: By implementing policies that promote sustainable development\n    - C: By ignoring climate change projections\n    - D: By reducing government spending on climate change initiatives\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more significant refinement needed."
