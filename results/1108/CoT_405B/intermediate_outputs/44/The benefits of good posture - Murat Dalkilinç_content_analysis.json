Sitting in an awkward position for a long time and using computers or mobile devices can promote poor posture.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1. Posture is the foundation for every movement the body makes and determines how well the body adapts to stresses.\n2. Good posture involves keeping the center of gravity directly over the base of support.\n3. The curves of the spine help absorb stress from activities like walking and jumping.\n4. Poor posture can lead to muscle imbalances, joint and ligament wear and tear, and decreased organ efficiency.\n5. Good posture can influence emotional state and sensitivity to pain.\n\n**Application**:\n\n1.

The cause-and-effect connection between poor posture and conditions like scoliosis, tension headaches, and back pain.\n4. The impact of modern technology (e.g., computers, mobile devices) on posture.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1. Combining good posture with regular movement and exercise to maintain overall physical health.\n2. Integrating ergonomic principles into daily activities, such as using a headset for phone calls or wearing shoes with good arch support.\n3.
