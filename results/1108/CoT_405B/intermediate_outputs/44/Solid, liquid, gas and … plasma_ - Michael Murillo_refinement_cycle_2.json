    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions for clarity, conciseness, and accuracy. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the universe is estimated to be made up of plasma?\n    - A: 25%\n    - B: 50%\n    - C: 75%\n    - D: 99.9%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What occurs when water molecules in steam are heated to a high enough temperature?\n    - A: They combine to form a solid\n    - B: They separate into freely roaming hydrogen and oxygen atoms\n    - C: They remain unchanged\n    - D: They transform into a liquid\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the result of the ionization process during plasma formation?\n    - A: The positively charged ions escape the atoms\n    - B: The negatively charged electrons escape the atoms, leaving behind positively charged ions\n    - C: The atoms become neutral\n    - D: The molecules combine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How do plasmas behave in magnetic fields?\n    - A: They remain stationary\n    - B: They are accelerated in a straight line\n    - C: They are steered in circular orbits\n    - D: They are unaffected\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is generated when particles within plasma collide or are accelerated by electricity or magnetism?\n    - A: Heat\n    - B: Light\n    - C: Sound\n    - D: Motion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is an example of a practical application of plasma technology in display devices?\n    - A: Solar panels\n    - B: Wind turbines\n    - C: Plasma TVs\n    - D: Nuclear reactors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is a potential future use of plasma technology in waste management?\n    - A: Creating more landfills\n    - B: Permanently ridding landfills of their waste\n    - C: Recycling plastics\n    - D: Burning waste\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How can plasmas be used in healthcare?\n    - A: Creating medicines\n    - B: Developing vaccines\n    - C: Diagnosing diseases\n    - D: Destroying or altering targeted chemicals to kill pathogenic organisms\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to enhance clarity and conciseness, while ensuring the correct answers remain accurate. The distractors are still plausible but incorrect, making the questions challenging yet fair."
