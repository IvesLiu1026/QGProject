    "refinement_output": "Since there is no initial set of questions provided, I will create new questions based on the transcript. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary reason why we don't feel pulled in billions of different directions by the gravitational force of every object in the universe?\n    - A: The mass of the objects is too small.\n    - B: The distance between the objects is too great.\n    - C: Both mass and distance play a role in reducing the gravitational force.\n    - D: The gravitational constant is too small.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, what happens to the gravitational force between two objects if the distance between them is doubled?\n    - A: The force remains the same.\n    - B: The force is doubled.\n    - C: The force is halved.\n    - D: The force is one-fourth as strong.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is the reason why astronauts on the International Space Station experience weightlessness?\n    - A: The space station is too far away from Earth's gravity.\n    - B: The space station is constantly falling towards Earth.\n    - C: The space station is in a region of zero gravity.\n    - D: The space station is orbiting the Earth too slowly.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How does the gravitational pull of the Earth on an object change as the object moves farther away from the Earth?\n    - A: The gravitational pull increases.\n    - B: The gravitational pull remains the same.\n    - C: The gravitational pull decreases but never drops to zero.\n    - D: The gravitational pull becomes zero at a certain distance.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) According to the transcript, what would happen to an object if it were placed at the center of a perfectly spherical Earth?\n    - A: The object would experience a strong gravitational pull towards the surface.\n    - B: The object would experience a weak gravitational pull towards the surface.\n    - C: The object would be suspended, weightless, due to equal pulls from all sides.\n    - D: The object would be pulled towards the center of the Earth.\n[Correct answer]: C"
