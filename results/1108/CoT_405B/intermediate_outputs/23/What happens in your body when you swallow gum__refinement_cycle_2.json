    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary material used in modern gum production?\n    - A: Natural latex\n    - B: Butyl rubber\n    - C: Synthetic fibers\n    - D: Tree resin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) According to the data, what percentage of Americans chew gum?\n    - A: 25%\n    - B: 40%\n    - C: 56%\n    - D: 75%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why does chewing gum not follow the same digestive process as standard food?\n    - A: Because it is high in sugar\n    - B: Because it is low in fiber\n    - C: Because it is primarily composed of non-digestible materials\n    - D: Because it is made from natural materials\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) How does the body handle swallowed gum in comparison to other non-digestible foods?\n    - A: It breaks down gum faster than other non-digestible foods\n    - B: It handles gum similarly to other non-digestible foods\n    - C: It takes longer to digest gum than other non-digestible foods\n    - D: It completely digests gum, unlike other non-digestible foods\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential benefit of understanding the consequences of swallowing gum?\n    - A: Reduced stress from chewing gum\n    - B: Increased consumption of gum\n    - C: Making informed decisions about gum-chewing habits\n    - D: Ignoring the risks associated with gum consumption\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential health benefit of chewing gum?\n    - A: Reduced risk of intestinal blockage\n    - B: Increased production of stomach acids\n    - C: Reduced levels of cortisol, a common stress hormone\n    - D: Improved digestion of gum\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the primary reason why the body cannot break down swallowed gum?\n    - A: The high sugar content in gum\n    - B: The composition of gum, specifically butyl rubber\n    - C: The lack of digestive enzymes in the stomach\n    - D: The size of the gum pieces\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a potential consequence of swallowing large amounts of gum?\n    - A: The formation of a bezoar in the digestive tract\n    - B: The breakdown of gum into smaller pieces\n    - C: The increased production of stomach acids\n    - D: The complete digestion of gum\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What new insight can be developed by combining the understanding of gum's composition and the body's digestive process?\n    - A: The benefits of chewing gum for stress reduction\n    - B: The effects of non-digestible foods on human health\n    - C: The importance of avoiding gum consumption\n    - D: The role of stomach acids in breaking down gum\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What balanced perspective can be created by integrating the knowledge of gum's benefits and drawbacks?\n    - A: That gum consumption should be completely avoided\n    - B: That gum is a healthy alternative to other snacks\n    - C: That gum can have both positive and negative effects on health\n    - D: That gum is only beneficial for stress reduction\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What judgment can be made about the myth surrounding gum and its digestion?\n    - A: The myth is entirely true\n    - B: The myth is partially true\n    - C: The myth is completely false\n    - D: The myth is still being researched\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What evaluation can be made about the potential risks and benefits of chewing gum?\n    - A: The benefits outweigh the risks for moderate consumption\n    - B: The risks outweigh the benefits\n    - C: The risks and benefits are equal\n    - D: There are no risks or benefits associated with gum consumption\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. However, I made minor adjustments to questions 3 and 6 to improve clarity and concision."
