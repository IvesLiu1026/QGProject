The king's advisor is tasked with determining the fine through a game of wits.\n3. The rules of the game: the merchant divides the rubies among three boxes, and the advisor writes a number between 1 and 30 on each of three cards.\n4. The constraints: each box must contain at least two rubies, and one box must contain exactly six more rubies than another.\n5. The goal is to guarantee the largest possible fine for the scoundrel and the greatest compensation for his victims.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The situation resembles an adversarial game like chess, but with incomplete information.\n2. The advisor needs to consider the worst-case scenario to minimize the merchant's winnings.\n3. The concept of proof by contradiction is used to determine the minimum number of rubies in two of the boxes.\n4. The advisor's strategy is to pick the same number for each box to ensure a minimum number of rubies.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. The game of wits can be applied to real-world scenarios where incomplete information is present, such as negotiations or auctions.\n2. The concept of proof by contradiction can be applied to various mathematical problems.\n3. The strategy of considering the worst-case scenario can be applied to decision-making in uncertain situations.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between the number of rubies in each box and the advisor's strategy is analyzed.\n2. The contrast between the merchant's goal (to keep as many rubies as possible) and the advisor's goal (to guarantee the largest possible fine) is highlighted.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the advisor's strategy and the outcome of the game is explored.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The idea of combining game theory and mathematical reasoning to solve a problem is demonstrated.\n2. The concept of proof by contradiction is used to synthesize new information and arrive at a conclusion.\n3. The strategy of considering the worst-case scenario is synthesized with the concept of proof by contradiction to arrive at the optimal solution.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The advisor's strategy is evaluated based on its effectiveness in achieving the goal of guaranteeing the largest possible fine.\n2. The merchant's actions are evaluated based on their morality and the consequences of his corrupt dealings.\n3. The king's decision to use a game of wits to determine the fine is evaluated based on its fairness and effectiveness in resolving the situation."
