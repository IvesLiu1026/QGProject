    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which of the following organs can be partially or entirely removed without significantly impacting the body's overall function?\n    - A: Heart\n    - B: Pancreas\n    - C: Liver\n    - D: Kidneys\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to remove brain as an option, as the transcript mentions that removing half of the brain can have significant effects.\n\n2) What is the primary function of the gallbladder in the digestive system?\n    - A: To filter waste and excess fluid from the blood\n    - B: To produce digestive enzymes\n    - C: To store bile produced by the liver\n    - D: To regulate body temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What allows the human body to adapt to extreme changes, such as the loss of an organ?\n    - A: The body's ability to regenerate new organs\n    - B: The presence of redundant systems\n    - C: The ability of one organ to take over the function of another\n    - D: The body's ability to repair damaged tissues\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What happens to the digestive system if the stomach is removed?\n    - A: It can no longer function\n    - B: It can still function, but patients may need to eat smaller, more frequent meals\n    - C: It becomes more efficient\n    - D: It is unaffected\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) A patient is considering donating a lung to a family member. What should the patient's doctor consider when making a decision about the patient's suitability for the procedure?\n    - A: The patient's overall health and well-being\n    - B: The patient's age and medical history\n    - C: The patient's ability to adapt to the loss of a lung\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What is unique about the liver's ability to regenerate itself?\n    - A: It is the only organ that can regenerate itself\n    - B: It can regenerate itself in a matter of days\n    - C: It can regenerate itself even if up to 65% of it is removed\n    - D: It is the fastest regenerating organ in the body\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What happens to patients who undergo a hemispherectomy, the removal of half of the brain?\n    - A: They experience significant cognitive deficits\n    - B: They experience some paralysis in the half of the body normally controlled by the missing brain hemisphere\n    - C: They are no longer able to walk\n    - D: They experience no significant side effects\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make option A more specific, as the transcript mentions that cognitive deficits are not typically a result of the procedure.\n\n8) What is an important consideration for individuals who have undergone a splenectomy, the removal of the spleen?\n    - A: They are more prone to infections\n    - B: They are less prone to infections\n    - C: They experience no significant changes in their immune system\n    - D: They require lifelong medication to compensate for the loss of the spleen\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nAdditional questions:\n\n9) What is the primary function of the spleen in the human body?\n    - A: To filter waste and excess fluid from the blood\n    - B: To produce digestive enzymes\n    - C: To store bile produced by the liver\n    - D: To regulate the immune system\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What happens to the remaining lung tissue after a pneumonectomy, the removal of a lung?\n    - A: It becomes less efficient\n    - B: It remains the same\n    - C: It expands to fill the extra space\n    - D: It becomes more efficient\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nThese additional questions assess the understanding of the spleen's function and the adaptation of the lung tissue after a pneumonectomy."
