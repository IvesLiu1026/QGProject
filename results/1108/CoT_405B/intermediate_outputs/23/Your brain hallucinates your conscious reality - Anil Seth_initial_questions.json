A: The rubber hand illusion demonstrates how the brain's predictions can be influenced by prior expectations\n    - B: The rubber hand illusion demonstrates how the brain's predictions can be influenced by sensory signals\n    - C: The rubber hand illusion demonstrates how the brain's predictions can be influenced by both prior expectations and sensory signals\n    - D: The rubber hand illusion demonstrates how the brain's predictions are independent of sensory signals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How does the speaker contrast the brain's ability to perceive the external world with its ability to perceive the internal state of the body?\n    - A: The speaker argues that the brain is more accurate in perceiving the external world\n    - B: The speaker argues that the brain is more accurate in perceiving the internal state of the body\n    - C: The speaker argues that the brain uses different mechanisms to perceive the external world and the internal state of the body\n    - D: The speaker argues that the brain's perception of the external world is influenced by its perception of the internal state of the body\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1) What is the speaker's proposed understanding of consciousness, and how does it combine ideas from different fields?\n    - A: The speaker proposes a purely neuroscientific understanding of consciousness\n    - B: The speaker proposes a philosophical understanding of consciousness that combines ideas from neuroscience and psychology\n    - C: The speaker proposes a psychological understanding of consciousness that combines ideas from neuroscience and philosophy\n    - D: The speaker proposes a multidisciplinary understanding of consciousness that combines ideas from neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) According to the speaker, what is the relationship between our individual self and worlds, and the biological mechanisms that underlie consciousness?\n    - A: Our individual self and worlds are independent of the biological mechanisms that underlie consciousness\n    - B: Our individual self and worlds are unique to each of us, but grounded in biological mechanisms shared with other living creatures\n    - C: Our individual self and worlds are solely the product of the biological mechanisms that underlie consciousness\n    - D: Our individual self and worlds are shaped by external factors, such as culture and environment\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1) What is the speaker's critique of the idea that consciousness can be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot?\n    - A: The speaker argues that consciousness is too complex to be replicated in artificial intelligence\n    - B: The speaker argues that consciousness is a unique feature of human biology and cannot be replicated in machines\n    - C: The speaker argues that consciousness is a product of the brain's predictions and prior expectations, and cannot be reduced to a software program\n    - D: The speaker argues that consciousness is a purely philosophical concept and cannot be understood through scientific inquiry\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) According to the speaker, what is the implication of recognizing the biological basis of consciousness for our understanding of artificial intelligence?\n    -
