    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary function of the meninges in the human body?\n    - A: To produce cerebrospinal fluid\n    - B: To protect the brain and spinal cord\n    - C: To regulate body temperature\n    - D: To aid in digestion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the most deadly form of meningitis?\n    - A: Fungal meningitis\n    - B: Viral meningitis\n    - C: Bacterial meningitis\n    - D: Parasitic meningitis\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What can happen if meningitis is left untreated?\n    - A: The disease will resolve on its own\n    - B: The disease will only cause mild symptoms\n    - C: The disease can cause death within a day\n    - D: The disease can cause long-term damage and increase the risk of death\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more accurate and specific.\n\n4) What is the primary goal of prevention and fast treatment in reducing the risk of meningitis?\n    - A: To reduce the risk of transmission\n    - B: To reduce the risk of death and long-term damage\n    - C: To reduce the risk of symptoms\n    - D: To reduce the risk of hospitalization\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) A friend has recently been diagnosed with meningitis, and you are concerned about contracting the disease. What precaution can you take to prevent transmission?\n    - A: Share utensils and personal items with your friend\n    - B: Avoid close contact with your friend\n    - C: Get vaccinated immediately\n    - D: Take antibiotics as a precaution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible but incorrect.\n\n6) You suspect that someone you know has meningitis. What should you do?\n    - A: Encourage them to rest and recover at home\n    - B: Seek medical attention immediately\n    - C: Give them antibiotics without a prescription\n    - D: Try to treat the symptoms with over-the-counter medication\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between the blood-brain barrier and meningitis bacteria?\n    - A: The blood-brain barrier prevents meningitis bacteria from entering the brain\n    - B: The blood-brain barrier allows meningitis bacteria to enter the brain freely\n    - C: The blood-brain barrier is tricked by meningitis bacteria into letting them through\n    - D: The blood-brain barrier has no role in preventing meningitis bacteria from entering the brain\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is a key factor in the deadliness of meningitis?\n    - A: The slow spread of the disease through the body\n    - B: The rapid spread of the disease through the body\n    - C: The severity of the symptoms\n    - D: The effectiveness of treatment options\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) How can combining knowledge of meningitis transmission and symptoms help individuals?\n    - A: By developing strategies for prevention and early detection\n    - B: By reducing the risk of transmission\n    - C: By reducing the severity of symptoms\n    - D: By improving treatment outcomes\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What can be gained from analyzing the immune response to meningitis?\n    - A: Insights into the development of new treatments that target specific aspects of the immune response\n    - B: A better understanding of the causes of meningitis\n    - C: A more effective way to prevent transmission\n    - D: A new method for diagnosing the disease\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) How can the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing meningitis be evaluated?\n    - A: By analyzing data on disease prevalence and vaccine distribution\n    - B: By conducting experiments on animals\n    - C: By surveying individuals who have received the vaccine\n    - D: By comparing the cost of vaccines to the cost of treatment\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What can be evaluated by analyzing data on treatment outcomes and disease progression?\n    - A: The importance of early treatment in reducing the risk of death and long-term damage from meningitis\n    - B: The effectiveness of vaccines in preventing meningitis\n    - C: The impact of public health strategies on meningitis outbreaks\n    - D: The relationship between the blood-brain barrier and meningitis bacteria\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nThe only refinement made was to question 3, where the correct answer was revised to make it more accurate and specific. The other questions did not require any refinement."
