Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many exquisite Burmese rubies does the merchant have?\n    - A: 20\n    - B: 25\n    - C: 30\n    - D: 35\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the constraint for the number of rubies in each box?\n    - A: Each box must contain at least one ruby\n    - B: Each box must contain at least two rubies\n    - C: Each box must contain at least three rubies\n    - D: Each box must contain at least four rubies\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What type of game is the situation between the merchant and the advisor similar to?\n    - A: A cooperative game like bridge\n    - B: An adversarial game like chess\n    - C: A game of chance like poker\n    - D: A game of skill like checkers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What concept is used by the advisor to determine the minimum number of rubies in two of the boxes?\n    - A: Proof by induction\n    - B: Proof by contradiction\n    - C: Proof by analogy\n    - D: Proof by construction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What real-world scenario can the game of wits between the merchant and the advisor be applied to?\n    - A: A negotiation between two parties with incomplete information\n    - B: A mathematical problem with complete information\n    - C: A decision-making process with certain outcomes\n    - D: A game of chance with random outcomes\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What concept can be applied to various mathematical problems, as demonstrated in the advisor's strategy?\n    - A: Proof by induction\n    - B: Proof by contradiction\n    - C: Game theory\n    - D: Decision theory\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the number of rubies in each box and the advisor's strategy?\n    - A: The advisor's strategy is independent of the number of rubies in each box\n    - B: The advisor's strategy is directly proportional to the number of rubies in each box\n    - C: The advisor's strategy is inversely proportional to the number of rubies in each box\n    - D: The advisor's strategy is based on the relative difference between the number of rubies in each box\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the contrast between the merchant's goal and the advisor's goal?\n    - A: The merchant wants to keep as many rubies as possible, while the advisor wants to guarantee the smallest possible fine\n    - B: The merchant wants to keep as many rubies as possible, while the advisor wants to guarantee the largest possible fine\n    - C: The merchant wants to give away as many rubies as possible, while the advisor wants to guarantee the smallest possible fine\n    - D: The merchant wants to give away as many rubies as possible, while the advisor wants to guarantee the largest possible fine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What idea is demonstrated by the advisor's strategy in combining game theory and mathematical reasoning?\n    - A: The idea that game theory and mathematical reasoning are mutually exclusive\n    - B: The idea that game theory and mathematical reasoning can be used separately to solve a problem\n    - C: The idea that game theory and mathematical reasoning can be combined to solve a problem\n    - D: The idea that game theory and mathematical reasoning are irrelevant to solving a problem\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What concept is synthesized with the concept of proof by contradiction to arrive at the optimal solution?\n    - A: The concept of considering the best-case scenario\n    - B: The concept of considering the worst-case scenario\n    - C: The concept of considering multiple scenarios\n    - D: The concept of considering no scenarios\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) How is the advisor's strategy evaluated in terms of its effectiveness?\n    - A: Based on its ability to guarantee the smallest possible fine\n    - B: Based on its ability to guarantee the largest possible fine\n    - C: Based on its ability to maximize the merchant's winnings\n    - D: Based on its ability to minimize the merchant's winnings\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the basis for evaluating the king's decision to use a game of wits to determine the fine?\n    - A: Its fairness and effectiveness in resolving the situation\n    - B: Its unfairness and ineffectiveness in resolving the situation\n    - C: Its morality and consequences for the merchant\n    - D: Its immorality and lack of consequences for the merchant\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12."
