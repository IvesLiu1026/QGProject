    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've refined the questions to ensure clarity, conciseness, and accuracy.\n\n1) What factors contribute to our inability to feel the gravitational force of every object in the universe?\n    - A: The mass of the objects is too small.\n    - B: The distance between the objects is too great.\n    - C: Both mass and distance play a role in reducing the gravitational force.\n    - D: The gravitational constant is too small.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, how does the gravitational force between two objects change when the distance between them is doubled?\n    - A: The force remains the same.\n    - B: The force is doubled.\n    - C: The force is halved.\n    - D: The force is one-fourth as strong.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) Why do astronauts on the International Space Station experience weightlessness?\n    - A: The space station is outside Earth's gravitational influence.\n    - B: The space station is constantly falling towards Earth while orbiting it.\n    - C: The space station is in a region of zero gravity.\n    - D: The space station is moving too slowly.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How does the gravitational pull of the Earth on an object change as the object moves farther away from the Earth?\n    - A: The gravitational pull increases.\n    - B: The gravitational pull remains the same.\n    - C: The gravitational pull decreases but never drops to zero.\n    - D: The gravitational pull becomes zero at a certain distance.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) If an object were placed at the center of a perfectly spherical Earth, what would happen to it?\n    - A: The object would experience a strong gravitational pull towards the surface.\n    - B: The object would experience a weak gravitational pull towards the surface.\n    - C: The object would be suspended, weightless, due to equal pulls from all sides.\n    - D: The object would be pulled towards the center of the Earth.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
