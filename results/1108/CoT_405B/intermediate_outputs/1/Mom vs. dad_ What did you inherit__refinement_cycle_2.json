    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the male population worldwide is affected by red-green color blindness?\n    - A: 2%\n    - B: 6%\n    - C: 10%\n    - D: 15%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which type of DNA is inherited from the mother and is associated with Type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease?\n    - A: Mitochondrial DNA\n    - B: Y-chromosome DNA\n    - C: X-chromosome DNA\n    - D: Autosomal DNA\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) What is the role of the X-chromosome in the inheritance of color blindness and balding in males?\n    - A: The X-chromosome has no influence on these traits.\n    - B: The X-chromosome plays a minor role in inheriting these traits.\n    - C: The X-chromosome plays a significant role in inheriting these traits, as males only inherit one X chromosome.\n    - D: The X-chromosome is the sole determinant of these traits.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the concept of \"Mitochondrial Eve\"?\n    - A: The idea that all human mitochondrial DNA originated from a single man.\n    - B: The idea that all human mitochondrial DNA originated from a single woman.\n    - C: The idea that all human mitochondrial DNA is identical.\n    - D: The idea that all human mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the father.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A man has a family history of balding and wants to know his risk factors. What information would be most relevant to him?\n    - A: The influence of genetics on facial features.\n    - B: The genetic basis of color blindness.\n    - C: The importance of mitochondrial DNA in disease development.\n    - D: The genetic basis of balding and its relationship to the X-chromosome.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) A woman is concerned about her risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and wants to know more about the genetic factors involved. What information would be most relevant to her?\n    - A: The influence of the X-chromosome on inherited traits.\n    - B: The importance of mitochondrial DNA in disease development.\n    - C: The genetic basis of color blindness.\n    - D: The role of environmental factors in disease development.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the X-chromosome and the inheritance of color blindness and balding?\n    - A: The X-chromosome has no influence on the inheritance of these traits.\n    - B: The X-chromosome plays a minor role in the inheritance of these traits.\n    - C: The X-chromosome plays a significant role in the inheritance of these traits, with males being more likely to inherit them.\n    - D: The X-chromosome is the sole determinant of these traits.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the contrast between the influence of the X-chromosome and the Y-chromosome on inherited traits?\n    - A: The X-chromosome has a greater influence on inherited traits than the Y-chromosome.\n    - B: The Y-chromosome has a greater influence on inherited traits than the X-chromosome.\n    - C: The X-chromosome and Y-chromosome have an equal influence on inherited traits.\n    - D: The X-chromosome and Y-chromosome have no influence on inherited traits.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What is the likely outcome of combining genetic and environmental factors in the development of balding?\n    - A: The genetic factors will override the environmental factors.\n    - B: The environmental factors will override the genetic factors.\n    - C: The combination of genetic and environmental factors will contribute to the development of balding.\n    - D: The development of balding is solely determined by genetic factors.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the potential outcome of studying allelic imbalance and mitochondrial DNA in disease research?\n    - A: It may lead to a greater understanding of the genetic basis of disease.\n    - B: It may lead to the development of new treatments for diseases.\n    - C: It may lead to a greater understanding of the environmental factors involved in disease development.\n    - D: It may lead to a greater understanding of the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in disease development.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI removed questions 11-18 as they were either duplicates or had incorrect information. I also rephrased some questions to make them clearer and more concise. Let me know if further refinement is necessary."
