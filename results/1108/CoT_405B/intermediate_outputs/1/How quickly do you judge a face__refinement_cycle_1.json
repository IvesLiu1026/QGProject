    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how long does it take for humans to extract significant information from faces?\n    - A: 500 milliseconds\n    - B: 1 second\n    - C: 100 milliseconds\n    - D: 2 seconds\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which brain region is thought to be an evolutionarily dedicated mechanism for processing faces?\n    - A: Amygdala\n    - B: Early visual cortex\n    - C: Fusiform cortex\n    - D: Cerebellum\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary function of the amygdala in processing faces?\n    - A: To process visual information\n    - B: To control facial expressions\n    - C: To analyze facial features\n    - D: To process emotional information and make rapid judgments about trustworthiness\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What is the significance of the brain's ability to quickly extract information from faces?\n    - A: It allows us to assess physical attractiveness\n    - B: It allows us to recognize familiar faces\n    - C: It allows us to ignore irrelevant information\n    - D: It allows us to assess important characteristics, such as gender, age, and emotional state\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) How can understanding how the brain processes faces inform strategies for improving social interactions?\n    - A: By ignoring facial expressions and focusing on verbal cues\n    - B: By trying to change our facial features to appear more trustworthy\n    - C: By relying solely on first impressions\n    - D: By being more aware of our own biases and trying to look beyond initial impressions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) In which fields can the study of facial perception be applied?\n    - A: Only in marketing and politics\n    - B: Only in education and psychology\n    - C: Only in law enforcement and employment\n    - D: In various fields, including marketing, politics, education, and psychology\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the relationship between the brain's processing of faces and our conscious awareness of these processes?\n    - A: Fully understood and straightforward\n    - B: Irrelevant to social interactions\n    - C: Only relevant to emotional processing\n    - D: Complex and not fully understood\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What does the research on facial perception suggest about our perceptions of others?\n    - A: That they are solely based on conscious evaluations\n    - B: That they are only influenced by obvious cues\n    - C: That they are completely under our conscious control\n    - D: That they can be influenced by subtle cues, such as slight changes in facial features\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) How can the study of facial perception be combined with other fields to gain a deeper understanding of human behavior and decision-making?\n    - A: By ignoring findings from other fields and focusing solely on facial perception\n    - B: By only considering the role of the amygdala in emotional processing\n    - C: By only examining the role of the fusiform cortex in face processing\n    - D: By incorporating findings from social psychology and neuroscience\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What can the findings of facial perception research be used to develop?\n    - A: Only new theories about emotional processing\n    - B: Only new technologies, such as facial recognition systems\n    - C: Only new strategies for improving social interactions\n    - D: New theories about how we make judgments about others and new technologies, such as facial recognition systems\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What important question does the study of facial perception raise about the use of facial recognition technology?\n    - A: Whether it is effective in security applications\n    - B: Whether it is only useful in marketing contexts\n    - C: Whether it is only relevant to law enforcement\n    - D: What are the ethics of using facial recognition technology in various applications\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What does the research on facial perception highlight about our own biases and judgments about others?\n    - A: That they are irrelevant to social interactions\n    - B: That they are only based on conscious evaluations\n    - C: That they are completely under our conscious control\n    - D: The need for greater awareness of our own biases and the importance of trying to look beyond initial impressions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo more significant refinement is needed, but minor adjustments can be made based on further feedback."
