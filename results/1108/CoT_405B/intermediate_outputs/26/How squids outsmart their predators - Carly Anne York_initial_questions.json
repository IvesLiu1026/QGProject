    "initial_questions": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is unique about the eyes of the colossal squid?\n    - A: They are the smallest in the animal kingdom\n    - B: They are only sensitive to light and dark\n    - C: They are the largest known eyes in the animal kingdom\n    - D: They can only detect colors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How many species of squid are there worldwide?\n    - A: Approximately 100 species\n    - B: Approximately 500 species\n    - C: Approximately 1,000 species\n    - D: Over 2,000 species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What is the primary function of chromatophores in squid?\n    - A: To aid in digestion\n    - B: To detect predators\n    - C: To mask themselves from predators\n    - D: To communicate with other squid\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What do squid use to rapidly shoot away from predators?\n    - A: Webbed arms\n    - B: Jet propulsion\n    - C: Fins\n    - D: Suckers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-World Scenarios)**\n\n1) A deep-sea squid is being pursued by a shark. What would be the most effective way for the squid to escape?\n    - A: Releasing ink to create a smokescreen\n    - B: Using jet propulsion to rapidly shoot away\n    - C: Changing color to blend in with the surroundings\n    - D: Using its webbed arms to distract the shark\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A squid is living in a murky estuary. How would it most likely detect predators?\n    - A: Using its large eyes\n    - B: Using its secondary sensory system\n    - C: Using its sense of smell\n    - D: Using its sense of hearing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, Contrasts, Cause-and-Effect)**\n\n1) What is the cause-and-effect relationship between a squid releasing ink and the behavior of a pursuing predator?\n    - A: The ink attracts the predator, making it more aggressive\n    - B: The ink confuses the predator, giving the squid time to escape\n    - C: The ink has no effect on the predator's behavior\n    - D: The ink repels the predator, causing it to retreat\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How does the size of a squid affect its ability to evade predators?\n    - A: Larger squid are more easily caught by predators\n    - B: Smaller squid are more easily caught by predators\n    - C: Size has no effect on a squid's ability to evade predators\n    - D: Larger squid are more likely to be ignored by predators\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1) How do squid combine their senses and adaptations to evade predators in different environments?\n    - A: By relying solely on their large eyes\n    - B: By using a combination of their secondary sensory system, chromatophores, and ink\n    - C: By using only their sense of smell\n    - D: By using only their sense of hearing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is an example of how squid adapt their behavior to different predator types?\n    - A: Using the same strategy for all predators\n    - B: Using jet propulsion to escape whales, but releasing ink to confuse dolphins\n    - C: Using chromatophores to camouflage themselves from all predators\n    - D: Using webbed arms to distract all predators\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, Critique, Justification)**\n\n1) Evaluate the effectiveness of squid adaptations in deep-sea environments.\n    - A: Squid adaptations are very effective in deep-sea environments\n    - B: Squid adaptations are somewhat effective in deep-sea environments\n    - C: Squid adaptations are not very effective in deep-sea environments\n    - D: Squid adaptations are completely ineffective in deep-sea environments\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Justify the importance of squid adaptations in their survival and proliferation.\n    - A: Squid adaptations are not important for their survival and proliferation\n    - B: Squid adaptations are somewhat important for their survival and proliferation\n    - C: Squid adaptations are very important for their survival and proliferation\n    - D: Squid adaptations are the only factor in their survival and proliferation\n[Correct answer]: C"
