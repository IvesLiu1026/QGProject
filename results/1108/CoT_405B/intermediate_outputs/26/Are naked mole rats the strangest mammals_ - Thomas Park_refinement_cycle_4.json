    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the average lifespan of a naked mole rat?\n    - A: 10 years\n    - B: 20 years\n    - C: 30 years\n    - D: 40 years\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) In a naked mole rat colony, how many males are typically chosen by the dominant female to reproduce?\n    - A: 1 male\n    - B: 2-3 males\n    - C: All males in the colony\n    - D: None, only females reproduce\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is unique about the social structure of naked mole rats compared to other mammals?\n    - A: They live in small family groups.\n    - B: They have a rigid hierarchy and division of labor similar to insects.\n    - C: They are solitary animals.\n    - D: They have a dominant male that leads the colony.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How do naked mole rats adapt to low oxygen levels in their underground tunnels?\n    - A: They increase their heart rate to pump more oxygen.\n    - B: They abandon thermoregulation and use a special type of hemoglobin.\n    - C: They dig more tunnels to increase oxygen flow.\n    - D: They reduce their activity levels to conserve oxygen.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What two adaptations enable naked mole rats to survive in low-oxygen environments?\n    - A: Increased heart rate and more efficient lungs\n    - B: Abandoning thermoregulation and using a special type of hemoglobin\n    - C: Digging more tunnels and reducing activity levels\n    - D: Developing larger muscles and increasing oxygen storage\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What potential benefit could studying naked mole rats' adaptations have for human health?\n    - A: Developing new treatments for cancer.\n    - B: Understanding how to slow down aging.\n    - C: Gaining insights for situations where oxygen is scarce.\n    - D: Improving vision in low-light conditions.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How could understanding naked mole rats' metabolism be applied to human medicine?\n    - A: Developing new treatments for diabetes.\n    - B: Creating new medications for heart conditions.\n    - C: Informing strategies for weight loss.\n    - D: Helping develop new treatments for medical emergencies, such as heart attacks.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the relationship between naked mole rats' social structure and their ability to survive in harsh environments?\n    - A: Their social structure makes them more vulnerable to predators.\n    - B: Their social structure allows them to conserve energy and resources.\n    - C: Their social structure has no impact on their survival.\n    - D: Their social structure makes them more susceptible to disease.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How does the metabolism of naked mole rats compare to that of plants?\n    - A: Naked mole rats and plants both require high levels of oxygen to metabolize.\n    - B: Naked mole rats and plants both use sunlight to produce energy.\n    - C: Naked mole rats can metabolize fructose without oxygen, similar to some plant processes.\n    - D: Naked mole rats and plants have completely different metabolic processes.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What potential breakthrough could be achieved by combining the unique traits of naked mole rats with human medical research?\n    - A: Developing a cure for cancer.\n    - B: Creating a new vaccine for infectious diseases.\n    - C: Leading to new treatments for oxygen-related disorders.\n    - D: Understanding the causes of aging.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a key advantage of naked mole rats' ability to enter a state of suspended animation?\n    - A: It allows them to conserve energy.\n    - B: It helps them regulate their body temperature.\n    - C: It enables them to metabolize glucose more efficiently.\n    - D: It increases their heart rate.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is a potential challenge of replicating naked mole rats' adaptations for human health?\n    - A: It could lead to unforeseen side effects.\n    - B: It would be too expensive to implement.\n    - C: It would require significant changes to human physiology.\n    - D: It would be too time-consuming to research.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n13) Why is studying naked mole rats' unique traits and adaptations important?\n    - A: Because they are an endangered species.\n    - B: Because they have a unique appearance.\n    - C: Because their adaptations could lead to breakthroughs in human medicine and beyond.\n    - D: Because they are a popular animal among scientists.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 9 (initial 9) and 14 as they were similar to other questions and didn't add any new information. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and conciseness. Additionally, I reviewed the distractors to ensure they are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
