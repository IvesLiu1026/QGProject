    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many glacial maxima have occurred in the last million years?\n    - A: 5\n    - B: 8\n    - C: 10\n    - D: 15\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What was the approximate increase in sea level after the ice sheets melted 20,000 years ago?\n    - A: 50 meters\n    - B: 70 meters\n    - C: 100 meters\n    - D: 130 meters\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is the term \"ice age\" considered in the scientific community?\n    - A: A formal term with a single agreed-upon definition\n    - B: An informal term with multiple definitions\n    - C: A term used to describe only the Last Glacial Maximum\n    - D: A term used to describe a specific geological period\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What are some of the natural processes that can cause significant changes in carbon dioxide levels over millions of years?\n    - A: Volcanism and changes in Earth's orbit\n    - B: Chemical weathering of rocks and the burial of organic matter\n    - C: Changes in Earth's orbit and the burial of organic matter\n    - D: Volcanism, chemical weathering of rocks, and the burial of organic matter\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) How can understanding the Earth's climate history inform predictions about future climate change?\n    - A: By providing data on current greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: By analyzing the relationship between carbon dioxide levels and global temperatures\n    - C: By studying the effects of past climate change on sea levels and ice sheets\n    - D: By recognizing the impact of natural processes on carbon dioxide levels\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What can be gained by studying the Earth's climate history?\n    - A: A comprehensive understanding of current greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: An understanding of the relationship between carbon dioxide levels and global temperatures\n    - C: Insights into the potential effects of future climate change on sea levels and ice sheets\n    - D: Knowledge of the impact of natural processes on carbon dioxide levels\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the primary driver of the current warming trend, according to the relationship between atmospheric carbon dioxide and global temperatures?\n    - A: Changes in Earth's orbit\n    - B: Natural processes such as volcanism and chemical weathering of rocks\n    - C: The increase in greenhouse gas emissions\n    - D: The interaction between the Earth's movement around the sun and natural processes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What does the contrast between the Last Glacial Maximum and the current warming trend highlight?\n    - A: The impact of natural processes on the climate\n    - B: The effect of changes in Earth's orbit on the climate\n    - C: The impact of human activities on the climate\n    - D: The role of volcanism in shaping the climate\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the expected consequence of continued warming on sea levels by the end of this century?\n    - A: A decrease of 10-30 centimeters\n    - B: An increase of 10-30 centimeters\n    - C: An increase of 30-100 centimeters\n    - D: An increase of 1-2 meters\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can be gained by combining knowledge of natural climate cycles with the impact of human activities on carbon dioxide levels?\n    - A: A comprehensive understanding of the Earth's climate history\n    - B: A comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to climate change\n    - C: A prediction of future climate change\n    - D: A strategy for mitigating the impacts of climate change\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is essential for informing decision-making about reducing carbon dioxide emissions?\n    - A: Evaluating the effectiveness of reducing emissions in curbing ice loss and protecting coastal communities\n    - B: Assessing the accuracy of computer models forecasting future climate change\n    - C: Justifying the need for immediate action to address climate change\n    - D: Understanding the potential consequences of climate change\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) Why is assessing the accuracy of computer models forecasting future climate change crucial?\n    - A: To develop effective policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: To predict the potential consequences of climate change\n    - C: To evaluate the effectiveness of current policies\n    - D: To inform decision-making about climate change mitigation and adaptation\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI removed questions 13, 14, and 15 as they were similar to other questions, and question 8 (initial) was removed due to duplication. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and conciseness. Additionally, I ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
