    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. Sperm whales use echolocation to hunt colossal squid.\n2. Colossal squid can put up an impressive fight against sperm whales.\n3. Squid have huge, round suction scars on the bodies of washed-up whales.\n4. Cephalopods include squid, ranging in size from 14 meters to 2.5 centimeters.\n5. There are approximately 500 squid species worldwide.\n6. Squid live in all the world's oceans.\n7. Squid are a reliable food source for whales, dolphins, sharks, seabirds, fish, and other squid.\n8. Squid have large, well-developed eyes, with the colossal squid having the largest known eyes in the animal kingdom.\n9. Squid have a secondary sensory system made from thousands of tiny hair cells.\n10. Squid skin contains thousands of tiny organs called chromatophores.\n11. Squid can release ink to create a smokescreen or a pseudomorph.\n12. Squid use jet propulsion to rapidly shoot away from predators.\n13. Squid have been on Earth for over 500 million years.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. Squid have evolved various adaptations to thwart their predators.\n2. Squid use their large eyes and secondary sensory system to detect predators.\n3. Squid can mask themselves from predators using chromatophores.\n4. Squid use ink to confuse predators and create a diversion.\n5. Squid have developed unique adaptive behaviors, such as using webbed arms or tossing sand.\n6. Squid are able to survive in the deep and unforgiving sea due to their adaptations.\n\n**Application (Real-World Scenarios)**\n\n1. How do squid adapt to different environments, such as estuarine, deep-sea, and open-water habitats?\n2. How do squid use their senses to detect predators in different situations?\n3. How do squid use their chromatophores to camouflage themselves in different environments?\n4. How do squid use ink to evade predators in different scenarios?\n5. How do squid use jet propulsion to escape predators in different situations?\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, Contrasts, Cause-and-Effect)**\n\n1. Compare and contrast the adaptations of different squid species.\n2. Analyze the relationship between squid size and their ability to evade predators.\n3. Explain how squid use their secondary sensory system to detect predators in dark or murky waters.\n4. Describe the cause-and-effect relationship between squid releasing ink and predator behavior.\n5. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of squid using jet propulsion to escape predators.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1. How do squid combine their senses and adaptations to evade predators in different environments?\n2. How do squid use their chromatophores and ink to create a comprehensive camouflage strategy?\n3. How do squid adapt their behavior to different predator types, such as whales and dolphins?\n4. How do squid use their unique adaptive behaviors to survive in different environments?\n5. How do squid evolve new adaptations to respond to changing environmental pressures?\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, Critique, Justification)**\n\n1. Evaluate the effectiveness of squid adaptations in different environments.\n2. Critique the limitations of squid senses and adaptations in certain situations.\n3. Justify the importance of squid adaptations in their survival and proliferation.\n4. Assess the impact of human activities on squid populations and their adaptations.\n5. Discuss the potential applications of squid adaptations in human technology and innovation."
