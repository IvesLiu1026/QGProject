    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I've refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) What is unique about the eyes of the colossal squid?\n    - A: They are highly sensitive to color\n    - B: They are capable of seeing in complete darkness\n    - C: They are the largest known eyes in the animal kingdom\n    - D: They are only sensitive to light and dark\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Approximately how many species of squid are found worldwide?\n    - A: 100 species\n    - B: 500 species\n    - C: 1,000 species\n    - D: 2,000 species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of chromatophores in squid?\n    - A: To aid in digestion\n    - B: To detect vibrations in the water\n    - C: To mask themselves from predators\n    - D: To communicate with other squid\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What do squid use to rapidly shoot away from predators?\n    - A: Webbed arms\n    - B: Jet propulsion\n    - C: Fins\n    - D: Suckers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A deep-sea squid is being pursued by a shark. What would be the most effective way for the squid to escape?\n    - A: Releasing ink to create a smokescreen\n    - B: Using jet propulsion to rapidly shoot away\n    - C: Changing color to blend in with the surroundings\n    - D: Using its webbed arms to distract the shark\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A squid is living in a murky estuary. How would it most likely detect predators?\n    - A: Using its large eyes\n    - B: Using its secondary sensory system\n    - C: Using its sense of smell\n    - D: Using its sense of hearing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the cause-and-effect relationship between a squid releasing ink and the behavior of a pursuing predator?\n    - A: The ink attracts the predator, making it more aggressive\n    - B: The ink confuses the predator, giving the squid time to escape\n    - C: The ink has no effect on the predator's behavior\n    - D: The ink repels the predator, causing it to retreat\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the size of a squid affect its ability to evade predators?\n    - A: Larger squid are more easily caught by predators\n    - B: Smaller squid are more easily caught by predators\n    - C: Size has no effect on a squid's ability to evade predators\n    - D: Larger squid are more likely to be ignored by predators\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How do squid combine their senses and adaptations to evade predators in different environments?\n    - A: By relying solely on their large eyes\n    - B: By using a combination of their secondary sensory system, chromatophores, and ink\n    - C: By using only their sense of smell\n    - D: By using only their sense of hearing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is an example of how squid adapt their behavior to different predator types?\n    - A: Using the same strategy for all predators\n    - B: Using jet propulsion to escape whales, but releasing ink to confuse dolphins\n    - C: Using chromatophores to camouflage themselves from all predators\n    - D: Using webbed arms to distract all predators\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) How effective are squid adaptations in deep-sea environments?\n    - A: Very effective\n    - B: Somewhat effective\n    - C: Not very effective\n    - D: Completely ineffective\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What role do squid adaptations play in their survival and proliferation?\n    - A: No role\n    - B: A minor role\n    - C: A significant role\n    - D: The sole determining factor\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nChanges made:\n\n- Minor rewording of questions for clarity and concision\n- No changes to correct answers\n- No changes to distractors, as they are plausible but incorrect\n\nNo more refinement needed."
