    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the approximate number of new neurons produced per day in the hippocampus of adults?\n    - A: 500\n    - B: 700\n    - C: 1,000\n    - D: 2,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which of the following factors can decrease neurogenesis?\n    - A: Exercise\n    - B: Learning\n    - C: High saturated fat\n    - D: Omega-3 fatty acids\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary role of the hippocampus in relation to neurogenesis?\n    - A: To regulate sleep patterns\n    - B: To control appetite\n    - C: To play a crucial role in learning, memory, and mood\n    - D: To coordinate motor functions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) How does the concept of neurogenesis challenge traditional views of the adult brain?\n    - A: It confirms that the adult brain cannot generate new nerve cells\n    - B: It suggests that the adult brain can only generate new nerve cells in certain regions\n    - C: It challenges the idea that the adult brain cannot generate new nerve cells\n    - D: It proves that the adult brain can only generate new nerve cells through exercise\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How can understanding neurogenesis help develop new treatments for mental health disorders?\n    - A: By targeting the production of new neurons in the hippocampus\n    - B: By focusing on the role of the cerebellum in mood regulation\n    - C: By ignoring the link between neurogenesis and depression\n    - D: By relying solely on pharmacological interventions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is a potential application of neurogenesis in the field of education?\n    - A: Designing learning strategies to promote the growth of new neurons\n    - B: Focusing on rote memorization techniques\n    - C: Ignoring the role of neurogenesis in learning\n    - D: Using only technology-based learning tools\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What does the relationship between neurogenesis and depression suggest about potential therapeutic approaches?\n    - A: That decreasing neurogenesis can help alleviate symptoms of depression\n    - B: That increasing neurogenesis can help alleviate symptoms of depression\n    - C: That neurogenesis has no role in depression\n    - D: That only pharmacological interventions can treat depression\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What does the effect of diet on neurogenesis highlight about maintaining good mental health?\n    - A: The importance of a high-sugar diet\n    - B: The importance of a balanced diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants\n    - C: The importance of a low-fat diet\n    - D: The importance of ignoring dietary factors\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What new insights can be gained by combining the concepts of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the brain's ability to adapt and change\n    - B: A confirmation that the adult brain cannot generate new nerve cells\n    - C: A focus on the role of the cerebellum in mood regulation\n    - D: A reliance solely on pharmacological interventions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What potential therapeutic approaches can arise from integrating the findings on neurogenesis with research on other neurological disorders?\n    - A: New treatments for depression, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurological disorders\n    - B: A focus on rote memorization techniques\n    - C: Ignoring the link between neurogenesis and neurological disorders\n    - D: Using only technology-based learning tools\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript.\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-10."
