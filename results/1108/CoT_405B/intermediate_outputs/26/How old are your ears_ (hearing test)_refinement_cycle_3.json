    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What frequency can typically be heard by individuals who are not hearing impaired?\n    - A: 4,000 Hertz\n    - B: 6,000 Hertz\n    - C: 8,000 Hertz\n    - D: 10,000 Hertz\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What happens to the extreme ends of the hearing spectrum as people age?\n    - A: They become more sensitive\n    - B: They remain unchanged\n    - C: They are completely lost\n    - D: They often decrease or are lost\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) How does the human ear's ability to hear high frequencies change with age?\n    - A: It increases\n    - B: It remains the same\n    - C: It decreases\n    - D: It becomes more sensitive\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the primary function of hair cells in the ear?\n    - A: To maintain balance\n    - B: To process visual information\n    - C: To detect and transmit sound frequencies\n    - D: To regulate ear pressure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) (Removed, as it was not directly related to the transcript)\n\n6) What can individuals do to protect their hearing in loud environments?\n    - A: Wear ear protection\n    - B: Listen to music at higher volumes\n    - C: Avoid regular hearing tests\n    - D: Ignore the risks of hearing loss\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) (Removed, as it is a duplicate of question 6)\n\n8) Why are hair cells tuned to high pitches more prone to damage?\n    - A: They are less sensitive to sound waves\n    - B: They are more prone to stress and degeneration due to their location\n    - C: They are equally susceptible to damage as hair cells tuned to low pitches\n    - D: They are not susceptible to damage\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the primary cause of hearing loss due to continual exposure to loud sounds?\n    - A: Damage to the outer ear\n    - B: Damage to the hair cells in the ear\n    - C: Damage to the brain's auditory processing centers\n    - D: Damage to the ear's balance system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) (Removed, as it was not directly related to the transcript)\n\n11) What could be a potential application of integrating knowledge of the ear's anatomy and the effects of aging on hearing?\n    - A: The design of more effective hearing aids or assistive listening devices\n    - B: The development of new treatments for hearing loss\n    - C: The creation of a cure for hearing loss\n    - D: The elimination of the need for hearing tests\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) (Removed, as it is a duplicate of question 11)\n\n13) (Removed, as it was not directly related to the transcript)\n\n14) What is a potential argument for stricter regulations on noise levels in public spaces?\n    - A: Noise pollution has no significant impact on hearing loss\n    - B: Current regulations are sufficient to protect public health\n    - C: Stricter regulations would be too costly to implement\n    - D: Noise pollution is a significant contributor to hearing loss, and stricter regulations are necessary to protect public health\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo further refinement is needed for the remaining questions."
