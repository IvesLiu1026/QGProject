    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge:**\n1) What are the two different phenomena categorized under the umbrella term \"tickling\"?\n    - A: Knismesis and hedonism\n    - B: Gargalesis and euphoria\n    - C: Knismesis and gargalesis\n    - D: Hedonism and euphoria\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which type of tickling is experienced by primates, including humans, but not by other mammals?\n    - A: Knismesis\n    - B: Gargalesis\n    - C: Hedonism\n    - D: Euphoria\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension:**\n1) What is the primary function of knismesis in animals?\n    - A: To induce laughter and smiling\n    - B: To serve as a protective mechanism against potential threats\n    - C: To stimulate social learning\n    - D: To promote play-fighting\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) According to the transcript, what is the purpose of gargalesis in young primates?\n    - A: To teach them how to laugh and smile\n    - B: To help them develop defensive skills through play-fighting\n    - C: To stimulate their sense of touch\n    - D: To promote social bonding\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application:**\n1) A horse whips its tail when a fly lands on its back. Which concept can be applied to understand this reaction?\n    - A: Gargalesis\n    - B: Knismesis\n    - C: Hedonism\n    - D: Euphoria\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Recognizing the vulnerable areas of the body can help individuals understand why they are more ticklish in certain spots. Which areas are typically ticklish in primates?\n    - A: Shoulders, elbows, and knees\n    - B: Ribs, underarms, under the chin, and near the femoral artery\n    - C: Ankles, wrists, and neck\n    - D: Hips, thighs, and calves\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis:**\n1) What is the primary difference between the reactions to knismesis and gargalesis?\n    - A: Knismesis induces laughter, while gargalesis induces rubbing\n    - B: Knismesis induces rubbing or scratching, while gargalesis induces laughter and smiling\n    - C: Knismesis induces pain, while gargalesis induces pleasure\n    - D: Knismesis induces pleasure, while gargalesis induces pain\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) According to the transcript, what is the potential evolutionary benefit of gargalesis?\n    - A: It helps primates develop their sense of touch\n    - B: It teaches young primates to defend themselves through play-fighting\n    - C: It promotes social bonding among primates\n    - D: It stimulates laughter and smiling\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis:**\n1) Combining the concepts of knismesis and gargalesis can lead to a deeper understanding of the complexities of:\n    - A: Human relationships\n    - B: Animal behavior\n    - C: Tickling and its role in human behavior\n    - D: Social learning\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Integrating the ideas of evolutionary mechanisms and social learning can provide insights into the development of:\n    - A: Human emotions\n    - B: Animal behavior\n    - C: Human behavior, particularly in the context of play-fighting and tickling\n    - D: Social norms\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation:**\n1) The theory that gargalesis is an evolutionary mechanism for teaching defensive skills can be evaluated based on its:\n    - A: Supporting evidence and potential limitations\n    - B: Relevance to human behavior and relationships\n    - C: Clarity and accuracy\n    - D: Scientific explanations\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) The idea that tickling is an essential part of human social learning can be critiqued and justified based on its:\n    - A: Supporting evidence and potential limitations\n    - B: Relevance to human behavior and relationships\n    - C: Clarity and accuracy\n    - D: Scientific explanations\n[Correct answer]: B"
