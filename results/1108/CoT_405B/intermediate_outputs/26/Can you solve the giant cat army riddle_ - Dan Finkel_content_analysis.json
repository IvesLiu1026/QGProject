    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge**:\n\n1. The control panel has three buttons: one that adds 5, one that adds 7, and one that takes the square root.\n2. The display initially reads zero.\n3. The code for the door is 2, 10, 14.\n4. If the display shows the same number more than once, a number greater than 60, or a non-whole number, the room will explode.\n5. The square root button can be used on specific numbers (4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49).\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1. The goal is to enter the code (2, 10, 14) in the correct order without resetting the display.\n2. The team needs to use the control panel buttons strategically to avoid triggering the traps.\n3. The square root button can be used to decrease the number, while the add 5 and add 7 buttons increase the number.\n\n**Application**:\n\n1. Real-world scenario: decoding a password or combination lock with specific constraints.\n2. Applying problem-solving skills to navigate through a complex system with limitations.\n3. Using mathematical operations (addition and square root) to achieve a specific goal.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. Identifying the relationships between the numbers and the control panel buttons.\n2. Recognizing the constraints and limitations of the system (e.g., avoiding repeated numbers, numbers greater than 60, and non-whole numbers).\n3. Analyzing the options for using the square root button and selecting the most suitable numbers (36, 16, and 49).\n4. Breaking down the problem into smaller steps and finding a sequence of operations to achieve the goal.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1. Combining mathematical operations (addition and square root) to create a solution.\n2. Integrating problem-solving skills with mathematical concepts to overcome obstacles.\n3. Generating a sequence of steps to achieve a specific goal, taking into account the constraints and limitations of the system.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1. Justifying the choice of using the square root button on specific numbers (36, 16, and 49).\n2. Evaluating the effectiveness of the solution in achieving the goal (entering the code 2, 10, 14).\n3. Assessing the efficiency of the solution, considering the number of steps required to achieve the goal.\n4. Critiquing the approach used to solve the problem, identifying potential areas for improvement."
