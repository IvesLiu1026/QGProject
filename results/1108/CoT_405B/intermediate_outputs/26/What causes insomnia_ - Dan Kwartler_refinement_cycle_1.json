Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the world's most common sleep disorder?\n    - A: Restless leg syndrome\n    - B: Insomnia\n    - C: Sleep apnea\n    - D: Narcolepsy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the primary source of energy for the brain?\n    - A: Cerebral glucose\n    - B: Adrenaline\n    - C: Cortisol\n    - D: Serotonin\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is a key characteristic of insomnia?\n    - A: A genetic disorder that affects sleep patterns\n    - B: A cycle of stress and restlessness that can be difficult to break\n    - C: A sleep disorder caused solely by physical pain\n    - D: A condition that only affects people with anxiety\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity.\n\n4) What can help regulate the circadian rhythm?\n    - A: Exposure to bright lights at night\n    - B: Consistent resting and waking times\n    - C: Drinking caffeine before bed\n    - D: Engaging in strenuous exercise before sleep\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) A person is experiencing stress about an upcoming test and is having difficulty sleeping. What is a likely cause of their insomnia?\n    - A: Increased serotonin levels\n    - B: Decreased cortisol levels\n    - C: Increased cortisol levels\n    - D: Decreased adrenaline levels\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) A person with insomnia is trying to establish a consistent sleep schedule. What can help them regulate their circadian rhythm?\n    - A: Creating a bright and noisy sleep environment\n    - B: Establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a dark, cool sleep environment\n    - C: Drinking caffeine before bed\n    - D: Engaging in strenuous exercise before sleep\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between stress and insomnia?\n    - A: Stress has no effect on insomnia\n    - B: Stress can help alleviate insomnia\n    - C: Stress can cause insomnia, and insomnia can cause more stress\n    - D: Insomnia is the primary cause of stress\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the contrast between healthy sleep and insomnia in terms of brain chemistry and metabolism?\n    - A: There is no difference\n    - B: Insomnia is characterized by increased serotonin levels\n    - C: The differences are minimal\n    - D: The differences are significant\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined for clarity.\n\n9) What can inform effective treatment strategies for insomnia?\n    - A: Understanding the complex interplay between stress, brain chemistry, and sleep habits\n    - B: Focusing solely on stress management\n    - C: Ignoring the role of genetics in sleep disorders\n    - D: Using only one treatment approach\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What can lead to more comprehensive treatment approaches for insomnia?\n    - A: Focusing solely on stress management\n    - B: Recognizing the relationships between insomnia, depression, and anxiety\n    - C: Ignoring the role of genetics in sleep disorders\n    - D: Using only one treatment approach\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is essential for promoting responsible treatment approaches for insomnia?\n    - A: Overusing sleeping pills\n    - B: Critiquing the overuse of sleeping pills and the potential for addiction\n    - C: Ignoring individual differences and the complexity of the disorder\n    - D: Using only one treatment approach\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What requires careful consideration of individual needs and circumstances in the treatment of insomnia?\n    - A: Using only one treatment approach\n    - B: Weighing the pros and cons of different treatment approaches\n    - C: Ignoring the role of genetics in sleep disorders\n    - D: Focusing solely on stress management\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nAdditional suggestions:\n- Consider adding more questions that address the specific strategies for managing insomnia, such as the importance of a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing sleep environment, and avoiding stimulating activities before bedtime.\n- Some questions could be rephrased to make them more concise and direct.\n- Ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and that the correct answers are accurate and supported by the transcript."
