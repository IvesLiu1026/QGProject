People with modest jobs, unspectacular bodies, and unglamorous friends can still have high self-esteem.\n3. Achievements, prestige, and financial security do not necessarily guarantee high self-esteem.\n4. Three factors that determine self-esteem are:\n   - Comparison with the same-sex parent\n   - Peer group\n   - Type of affection received in childhood (conditional or unconditional)\n5. People from poor backgrounds may have an advantage in terms of self-esteem if they have outpaced their same-sex parent.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. Self-esteem is not solely determined by external factors, but rather by internal, subjective logic.\n2. The way we compare ourselves to our same-sex parent can affect our self-esteem.\n3. Our peer group has a significant impact on our self-esteem, particularly if someone in our peer group achieves great success.\n4. The type of affection we received in childhood can shape our self-esteem, with unconditional love leading to higher self-esteem.\n5. Understanding the origins of self-esteem is crucial to recognizing that success alone may not lead to feeling good about oneself.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. Recognizing the importance of self-esteem in one's well-being can lead to a greater emphasis on self-care and self-acceptance.\n2. Understanding the factors that determine self-esteem can help individuals identify areas where they may need to work on building their self-esteem.\n3. The concept of self-esteem can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as in education, where teachers can promote self-esteem in students by providing unconditional support and encouragement.\n4. The idea that self-esteem is not solely determined by external factors can be applied to therapy, where individuals can work on building their self-esteem through self-reflection and self-acceptance.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between self-esteem and external factors, such as achievements and financial security, is complex and not always direct.\n2. The way we compare ourselves to others, particularly our same-sex parent and peer group, can have a significant impact on our self-esteem.\n3. The type of affection we received in childhood can shape our self-esteem, with unconditional love leading to higher self-esteem.\n4. The concept of self-esteem is closely tied to psychology, rather than solely being the result of external achievements.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. Combining the ideas of self-esteem, comparison, and affection can lead to a deeper understanding of how self-esteem is formed and maintained.\n2. Integrating the concept of self-esteem with other psychological concepts, such as shame and humiliation, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior.\n3. Recognizing the importance of self-esteem in one's well-being can lead to the development of new strategies for promoting self-esteem, such as through education and therapy.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The idea that self-esteem is not solely determined by external factors can be evaluated in terms of its implications for education and therapy.\n2. The concept of self-esteem can be critiqued in terms of its cultural and societal context, with different cultures placing varying emphasis on self-esteem.\n3. The relationship between self-esteem and mental health can be evaluated, with a focus on how self-esteem can impact mental health outcomes.\n4.
