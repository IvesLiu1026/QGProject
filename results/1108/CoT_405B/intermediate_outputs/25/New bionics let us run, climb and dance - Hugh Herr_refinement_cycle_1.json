    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary goal of the Center for Extreme Bionics at the MIT Media Lab?\n    - A: To develop technologies for the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of animals.\n    - B: To develop technologies for the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans across a broad range of brain and body disabilities.\n    - C: To develop technologies for the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of robots.\n    - D: To develop technologies for the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of computers.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many patients have been fitted with the BiOM bionic limb, including wounded U.S. soldiers?\n    - A: Nearly 500 patients, including 100 wounded U.S. soldiers.\n    - B: Nearly 1,000 patients, including 400 wounded U.S. soldiers.\n    - C: Nearly 2,000 patients, including 800 wounded U.S. soldiers.\n    - D: Nearly 5,000 patients, including 2,000 wounded U.S. soldiers.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What drives the speaker's work in bionics?\n    - A: His experience with losing his legs and developing bionic limbs to eliminate his own disability and ultimately the disability of others.\n    - B: His desire to become a famous scientist.\n    - C: His interest in robotics and artificial intelligence.\n    - D: His passion for sports and space exploration.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is the goal of bionics according to the speaker?\n    - A: To eliminate disability and enhance human capability.\n    - B: To create robots that can perform human tasks.\n    - C: To develop technologies for space exploration.\n    - D: To improve human vision and hearing.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) How can bionic limbs be used to enhance the mobility and independence of individuals with amputations or paralysis?\n    - A: By providing them with prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by their thoughts.\n    - B: By allowing them to walk and run without assistance.\n    - C: By enabling them to perform daily tasks without assistance.\n    - D: All of the above.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What is a potential application of exoskeletons in individuals with normal physiology?\n    - A: Enhancing human movement and reducing fatigue.\n    - B: Improving human vision and hearing.\n    - C: Enhancing human intelligence and memory.\n    - D: Reducing human stress and anxiety.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What does the speaker's experience with losing his legs and developing bionic limbs highlight?\n    - A: The relationship between technology and disability.\n    - B: The importance of human rights and accessibility.\n    - C: The need for inclusive design and technology.\n    - D: The potential risks and benefits of bionic technologies.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What does the development of bionic limbs and exoskeletons raise questions about?\n    - A: The boundaries between human and machine.\n    - B: The ethics of enhancing human capability.\n    - C: The responsibility of designers and engineers to create inclusive and accessible technologies.\n    - D: All of the above.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What has the potential to revolutionize the field of prosthetics and rehabilitation?\n    - A: The development of bionic limbs and exoskeletons.\n    - B: The use of sensing and smart materials in bionic limbs.\n    - C: The combination of advances in materials science, robotics, and biomechanics.\n    - D: All of the above.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What could be combined with advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning to create more sophisticated and intuitive control systems?\n    - A: The use of sensing and smart materials in bionic limbs.\n    - B: The development of exoskeletons.\n    - C: The speaker's emphasis on human rights and accessibility.\n    - D: The BiOM bionic limb.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What does the speaker's argument that humans are not disabled, but rather, our technologies and built environment are, raise questions about?\n    - A: The responsibility of designers and engineers to create inclusive and accessible technologies.\n    - B: The ethics of enhancing human capability.\n    - C: The potential risks and benefits of bionic technologies.\n    - D: The importance of human rights and accessibility.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is the ultimate goal of the speaker's work in bionics?\n    - A: To create advanced prosthetic limbs for individuals with amputations.\n    - B: To develop exoskeletons for individuals with paralysis.\n    - C: To end disability and enhance human capability through technological innovation.\n    - D: To improve human vision and hearing.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made some minor adjustments to the questions to ensure they are clear and concise, and the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also rephrased some questions to better align with the key concepts in the transcript."
