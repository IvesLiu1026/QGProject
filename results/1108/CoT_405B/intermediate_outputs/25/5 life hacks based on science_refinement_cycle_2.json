    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of light is allowed to pass through polarized sunglasses?\n    - A: Light waves aligned in any direction\n    - B: Light waves aligned in a specific direction\n    - C: Light waves with high energy\n    - D: Light waves with low energy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) According to physicists, what is the primary reason why headphones get tangled?\n    - A: The material used to make the headphones\n    - B: The way people store their headphones\n    - C: The ends of the headphones poking through loops\n    - D: The weight of the headphones\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What concept explains how polarized sunglasses work?\n    - A: The principle of \"like dissolves like\"\n    - B: The concept of polarization\n    - C: The greenhouse effect\n    - D: The idea of static electricity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to high-energy light inside a parked car?\n    - A: It is reflected back out of the car\n    - B: It is absorbed by objects and re-emitted as low-energy light\n    - C: It is absorbed by objects and not re-emitted\n    - D: It is not affected by the car's interior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can you reduce glare from reflective surfaces while driving?\n    - A: By wearing non-polarized sunglasses\n    - B: By wearing polarized sunglasses\n    - C: By not wearing sunglasses at all\n    - D: By using a different type of lens\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can you do to discharge static electricity after sliding across a car seat?\n    - A: Touch the outside of a car door frame\n    - B: Touch the inside of a car door frame\n    - C: Touch a non-metal object\n    - D: Do nothing\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between the polarization of light and the effectiveness of polarized sunglasses?\n    - A: Polarized sunglasses are more effective with non-polarized light\n    - B: Polarized sunglasses are more effective with polarized light\n    - C: Polarized sunglasses are equally effective with polarized and non-polarized light\n    - D: Polarized sunglasses are less effective with polarized light\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the greenhouse effect and the heating up of a parked car?\n    - A: The greenhouse effect causes the car to cool down\n    - B: The greenhouse effect causes the car to heat up\n    - C: The greenhouse effect has no effect on the car's temperature\n    - D: The car's temperature affects the greenhouse effect\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can you use a phone screen to check if sunglasses are polarized?\n    - A: By looking at the phone screen through the sunglasses and rotating the screen\n    - B: By looking at the phone screen through the sunglasses and rotating the sunglasses\n    - C: By not using the phone screen at all\n    - D: By using a different type of screen\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) How can the principle of \"like dissolves like\" be applied to remove sticker residue?\n    - A: By using oil to remove non-polar substances\n    - B: By using oil to remove polar substances\n    - C: By using non-polar substances to remove polar substances\n    - D: By using polar substances to remove non-polar substances\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were duplicates of questions 5 and 10, respectively.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
