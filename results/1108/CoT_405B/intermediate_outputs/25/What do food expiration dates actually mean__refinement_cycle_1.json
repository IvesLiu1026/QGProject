What method can they use?\n    - A: Checking the color and texture\n    - B: Tasting a small sample\n    - C: Using a thermometer\n    - D: Smelling for volatile organic compounds (VOCs)\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What factors can affect the growth of mold on produce?\n    - A: Type of produce\n    - B: Storage temperature\n    - C: Handling procedures\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the relationship between the type of food and its shelf life?\n    - A: All foods have the same shelf life\n    - B: The type of food has no impact on shelf life\n    - C: The shelf life of food is solely determined by storage conditions\n    - D: Different foods have varying shelf lives\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) A food manufacturer wants to develop a new strategy for extending the shelf life of their products. What approach can they take?\n    - A: Focusing solely on food preservation methods\n    - B: Ignoring food spoilage and concentrating on packaging\n    - C: Using only one method of food preservation\n    - D: Combining knowledge of food spoilage with understanding of food preservation methods\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is a potential risk of consuming food past its expiration date?\n    - A: The food may be too fresh\n    - B: The food may have lost its nutritional value\n    - C: The food may have changed texture\n    - D: The food may have spoiled and cause foodborne illness\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is a potential criticism of current food labeling practices?\n    - A: They are too strict\n    - B: They prioritize food safety over quality\n    - C: They are too lenient\n    - D: They can be misleading and do not ensure food safety\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is the purpose of pasteurization in milk production?\n    - A: To add flavor to the milk\n    - B: To increase the shelf life of milk\n    - C: To denature enzymes in living bacteria and render them harmless\n    - D: To change the texture of milk\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed question 10 from the initial set, as it was similar to question 12, and replaced it with a new question that focuses on the purpose of pasteurization in milk production."
