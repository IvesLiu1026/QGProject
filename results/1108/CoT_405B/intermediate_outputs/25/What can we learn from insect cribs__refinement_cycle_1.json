    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is a key characteristic of eusocial animals, such as honey bees?\n    - A: They live in pairs with a dominant male.\n    - B: They live in multi-generational groups with a division of labor and a caste system.\n    - C: They are solitary animals that only come together to mate.\n    - D: They are migratory animals that travel long distances each year.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which type of insect is known for building delicate papery nests by mixing their saliva with wood fibers?\n    - A: Carpenter ants\n    - B: Paper wasps\n    - C: Fire ants\n    - D: Weaver ants\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary difference between eusocial and semi-social insect societies?\n    - A: Eusocial societies have a single queen, while semi-social societies have multiple queens.\n    - B: Eusocial societies have a division of labor, while semi-social societies do not.\n    - C: Eusocial societies are highly organized, while semi-social societies are more disorganized.\n    - D: Eusocial societies have a strict caste system, while semi-social societies do not.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is a distinctive feature of the social structure of termites?\n    - A: Termites have a single queen that reproduces rapidly and becomes imprisoned within her royal chamber.\n    - B: Termites have a single king that dominates the colony and makes all decisions.\n    - C: Termites have a complex caste system with multiple queens and kings.\n    - D: Termites are solitary animals that only come together to mate.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) How can understanding the social structure of insects inform strategies for controlling pest populations?\n    - A: By identifying the queen and removing her from the colony.\n    - B: By using insecticides to kill the entire colony.\n    - C: By understanding the division of labor and targeting specific castes.\n    - D: By disrupting communication systems within the colony.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential application of studying insect social behavior?\n    - A: Developing more effective pesticides.\n    - B: Understanding human social behavior and developing more effective social structures.\n    - C: Improving agricultural practices by understanding pollination and pest management.\n    - D: Developing new medical treatments inspired by insect social immunity.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is a primary benefit of eusociality in insects?\n    - A: Increased reproductive success for individual insects.\n    - B: Improved defense against predators.\n    - C: Enhanced foraging efficiency and resource allocation.\n    - D: Increased complexity of social behaviors.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a potential cost of eusociality in insects?\n    - A: Reduced reproductive success for individual insects.\n    - B: Increased energy expenditure for foraging.\n    - C: Decreased defense against predators.\n    - D: Reduced adaptability to changing environments.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) How can insect sociality be seen as a continuum?\n    - A: As a range of different species exhibiting different levels of social complexity.\n    - B: As a single, fixed trait that is present or absent in different species.\n    - C: As a series of distinct categories with clear boundaries.\n    - D: As a random collection of different social behaviors.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is the relationship between the evolution of sociality in insects and the development of complex communication systems?\n    - A: Sociality evolved first, followed by the development of complex communication systems.\n    - B: Complex communication systems evolved first, followed by the development of sociality.\n    - C: Sociality and complex communication systems evolved simultaneously.\n    - D: There is no relationship between sociality and complex communication systems.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the potential consequence of losing key ecological functions and services provided by insects?\n    - A: Minor impacts on ecosystems and human societies.\n    - B: Significant impacts on ecosystems and human societies.\n    - C: No impacts on ecosystems and human societies.\n    - D: Positive impacts on ecosystems and human societies.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) How can the effectiveness of different strategies for controlling pest populations be evaluated?\n    - A: By measuring the number of insects killed.\n    - B: By assessing the impacts on non-target species and ecosystems.\n    - C: By evaluating the cost of the strategy.\n    - D: By considering the long-term consequences for ecosystem health.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to enhance clarity and conciseness. I also confirmed that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. No major changes were necessary, as the initial questions were well-written and aligned with the key concepts in the transcript."
