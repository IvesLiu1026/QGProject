The Constitutional Convention was held in Philadelphia on May 14, 1787.\n3. The purpose of the Convention was to draft revisions to the Articles of Confederation.\n4. All 13 states had to agree to any changes under the Articles of Confederation.\n5. Rhode Island did not send delegates to the Convention.\n6. The necessary quorum of seven states was achieved on May 25th.\n7. 55 delegates attended the Convention, all of whom were white males, property owners, and had an average age of 44.\n8. Some delegates, such as James Madison and Roger Sherman, had signed the Declaration of Independence.\n9. The delegates voted to keep their discussions secret to encourage honest debate.\n10. The Constitutional Convention lasted for three months.\n11. The signed Constitution was presented on September 17th, 1787.\n\n**Comprehension** (Understanding or interpretation of important concepts):\n\n1. The young United States was struggling with uprisings, boundary disputes, and a lack of common vision after the Revolutionary War.\n2. The Constitutional Convention was called to address these issues and provide stability to the country.\n3. The Articles of Confederation were deemed inadequate, and the delegates decided to create a new, more nationalistic document.\n4. The risk of overthrowing the existing government was immense, and the delegates' actions were a significant gamble.\n5. The country debated and argued over the Constitution for two years before its adoption.\n\n**Application** (Real-world applications or scenarios):\n\n1. The importance of secrecy in sensitive discussions, as seen in the Constitutional Convention, can be applied to modern-day diplomatic negotiations or high-stakes business deals.\n2. The process of drafting and adopting the Constitution can be compared to modern-day constitutional reforms or the creation of new governments.\n3. The challenges faced by the young United States, such as uprisings and boundary disputes, can be applied to contemporary issues in countries experiencing similar struggles.\n\n**Analysis** (Relationships, contrasts, or cause-and-effect connections):\n\n1. The relationship between the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation and the need for a new Constitution.\n2. The contrast between the original purpose of the Convention (revising the Articles) and the actual outcome (creating a new Constitution).\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the delegates' decision to keep their discussions secret and the successful outcome of the Convention.\n4. The comparison between the relatively smooth process of the Constitutional Convention and the challenges faced during the ratification process.\n\n**Synthesis** (Combining ideas to form new understanding):\n\n1. The combination of the delegates' vision, education, and experience led to the creation of a robust and enduring Constitution.\n2. The intersection of historical events, such as the Revolutionary War and the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, created a unique opportunity for the Constitutional Convention to shape the country's future.\n3. The relationship between the Constitutional Convention and the principles of democracy, such as representation, federalism, and individual rights.\n\n**Evaluation** (Judgment, critique, or justification):\n\n1. The decision to overthrow the existing government and create a new Constitution can be evaluated as a bold and visionary move or a reckless and power-hungry act.\n2. The morality of the delegates' actions, particularly in regards to the secrecy and deception involved, can be debated and evaluated.\n3. The effectiveness of the Constitutional Convention in addressing the country's problems and creating a lasting framework for government can be assessed and critiqued."
