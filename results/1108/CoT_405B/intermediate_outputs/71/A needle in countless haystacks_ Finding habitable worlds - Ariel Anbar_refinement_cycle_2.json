    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many galaxies are estimated to be in the universe?\n    - A: 100 million\n    - B: 100 billion\n    - C: 1 trillion\n    - D: 10 trillion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of Earth's surface is covered by oceans?\n    - A: One-quarter\n    - B: One-half\n    - C: Three-quarters\n    - D: Three-fifths\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why do scientists focus on habitable worlds in the search for life in the universe?\n    - A: To find planets with conditions similar to those of Mars\n    - B: To identify planets that can support human life\n    - C: To narrow down the search for life by identifying planets with conditions necessary for life as we know it\n    - D: To study the properties of stars\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What can the study of Earth and its properties provide insights into?\n    - A: The formation of galaxies\n    - B: The properties of stars\n    - C: What makes a planet habitable\n    - D: The search for life on Mars\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How do astronomers use the concept of the habitable zone?\n    - A: To identify potential planets that could support life\n    - B: To study the properties of stars\n    - C: To design missions to search for life on other planets\n    - D: To determine the size of a planet\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What does the study of extremophiles on Earth inform?\n    - A: The search for life on other planets and moons\n    - B: The study of the properties of stars\n    - C: The search for life on Mars\n    - D: The formation of galaxies\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What factors determine a planet's habitability?\n    - A: Size and atmosphere only\n    - B: Distance from its star only\n    - C: Size, atmosphere, and distance from its star\n    - D: Presence of liquid water only\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What does the study of Venus highlight in determining a planet's habitability?\n    - A: The importance of considering a planet's size\n    - B: The importance of considering a planet's atmosphere\n    - C: The importance of considering a planet's distance from its star\n    - D: The importance of considering a planet's moons\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can the concept of the habitable zone be combined with the study of extremophiles?\n    - A: To expand our understanding of what makes a planet habitable\n    - B: To narrow down the search for life to Earth-like planets\n    - C: To study the properties of stars\n    - D: To determine the size of a planet\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can the study of Earth's diverse ecosystems and the conditions that support life inform?\n    - A: The search for life on other planets and moons\n    - B: The study of the properties of stars\n    - C: The search for life on Mars\n    - D: The formation of galaxies\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a limitation of the habitable zone concept, as illustrated by the example of Venus?\n    - A: It is too narrow and excludes potential habitable planets\n    - B: It is too broad and includes planets that are not habitable\n    - C: It does not consider a planet's atmosphere\n    - D: It does not consider a planet's size\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is an implication of the discovery of extremophiles on Earth for our understanding of what makes a planet habitable?\n    - A: It suggests that life can only exist on Earth-like planets\n    - B: It suggests that life can exist in a wide range of environments\n    - C: It suggests that life can only exist in extreme environments\n    - D: It suggests that life cannot exist on other planets\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
