    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. Stress can cause physical symptoms such as sweaty palms, a foggy mind, and a racing heart.\n2. Stress hormones, including cortisol, are released in response to potential danger.\n3. The hypothalamus is the master controller of hormones and releases corticotropin-releasing hormone.\n4. The pituitary gland releases adrenocorticotropic hormone, which stimulates the adrenal gland to release cortisol.\n5. Cortisol increases inflammation, suppresses the immune system, and increases oil production in the skin.\n6. Sebaceous glands produce oily lipids called sebum.\n7. Testosterone increases oil production in the skin.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. Stress is a general biological response to potential danger, triggering the \"fight or flight\" response.\n2. The brain's response to stress involves the release of stress hormones, which can affect overall health.\n3. Internalized stress can lead to physical symptoms, such as acne.\n4. Confidence and a positive response to stressful situations can help mitigate their impact.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. Students can apply the concept of stress response to their own experiences with exams, public speaking, or social interactions.\n2. Individuals can recognize the physical symptoms of stress and take steps to manage them.\n3. Understanding the role of hormones in stress response can inform strategies for managing stress and acne.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and contrasts)**\n\n1. The relationship between stress, hormones, and physical symptoms, such as acne.\n2. The contrast between the \"fight or flight\" response and the internalized stress response.\n3. The impact of testosterone on oil production in the skin and its role in acne development.\n4. The connection between confidence and stress response.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. The combination of stress hormones, inflammation, and oil production creates a perfect storm for acne development.\n2. The interplay between the brain, hormones, and physical symptoms highlights the complex nature of stress response.\n3. The relationship between confidence, stress response, and physical symptoms suggests that managing stress can have a positive impact on overall health.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of stress management strategies in reducing physical symptoms.\n2. Critiquing the impact of societal expectations and pressures on stress levels and physical health.\n3. Justifying the importance of self-care and stress management in maintaining overall health and well-being.\n4. Assessing the role of individual factors, such as confidence and self-esteem, in shaping stress response and physical symptoms."
