    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge:**\n1) What is the first step in the cloning process of a sheep?\n    - A: An egg cell is obtained from another sheep.\n    - B: A cell is harvested from the sheep to be cloned.\n    - C: The new cell is stimulated with an electric shock.\n    - D: The new cell is placed in the womb of another sheep.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How long is the gestation period for the cloned sheep?\n    - A: 3 months\n    - B: 6 months\n    - C: 9 months\n    - D: 12 months\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension:**\n1) What is the primary goal of cloning a sheep?\n    - A: To create a genetically diverse copy of the original sheep\n    - B: To create a genetically identical copy of the original sheep\n    - C: To induce hibernation in the egg cell\n    - D: To manipulate the specialized cell\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What does cloning involve in terms of genetic material?\n    - A: Taking genetic material from one sheep and inserting it into a specialized cell from the same sheep\n    - B: Taking genetic material from one sheep and inserting it into an egg cell from another sheep\n    - C: Removing genetic material from the egg cell\n    - D: Removing genetic material from the specialized cell\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application:**\n1) In which field can cloning be applied to reproduce high-quality livestock?\n    - A: Medical research\n    - B: Conservation\n    - C: Agriculture\n    - D: Biotechnology\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a potential use of cloning in medical research?\n    - A: Studying genetic diseases\n    - B: Preserving endangered species\n    - C: Creating genetically modified organisms\n    - D: Developing new medical treatments\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis:**\n1) What is the relationship between the specialized cell and the egg cell in cloning?\n    - A: The specialized cell is used to induce hibernation in the egg cell\n    - B: The egg cell is used to induce hibernation in the specialized cell\n    - C: The specialized cell is inserted into the egg cell\n    - D: The egg cell is inserted into the specialized cell\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection between removing the cell's food supply and inducing hibernation?\n    - A: Removing the food supply causes the cell to divide\n    - B: Removing the food supply causes the cell to induce hibernation\n    - C: Inducing hibernation causes the cell to remove its food supply\n    - D: Inducing hibernation causes the cell to divide\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis:**\n1) What could be a potential outcome of combining genetic engineering with cloning?\n    - A: Creating sheep with undesirable traits\n    - B: Creating sheep with desirable traits\n    - C: Preserving endangered species\n    - D: Studying genetic diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What could be a potential outcome of integrating cloning with stem cell research?\n    - A: Insights into regenerative medicine\n    - B: Insights into genetic diseases\n    - C: Creation of genetically modified organisms\n    - D: Preservation of endangered species\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation:**\n1) What is a topic of debate regarding cloning animals?\n    - A: The ethics of cloning animals for agricultural purposes\n    - B: The ethics of cloning animals for medical research\n    - C: The ethics of cloning animals for conservation\n    - D: The ethics of cloning animals for biotechnology\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What should be considered when evaluating the potential risks and benefits of cloning in medical research?\n    - A: Only the potential benefits\n    - B: Only the potential risks\n    - C: Both the potential risks and benefits\n    - D: Neither the potential risks nor benefits\n[Correct answer]: C"
