    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. The Electoral College is a group of people appointed by each state to formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States.\n2. The number of electors is specified in Article 2, Section 1, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution.\n3. There have been 538 electors in each presidential election since 1964.\n4. The number of electors is equal to the total voting membership of the United States Congress (435 representatives + 100 senators + 3 electors from the District of Columbia).\n5. The census is conducted every 10 years to determine the number of electors for each state.\n6. States with a large number of electoral votes include California (55), Texas, Florida, and New York.\n7. A candidate needs to win at least 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The Electoral College system is designed to balance the interests of large and small states in the presidential election process.\n2. Each state receives a certain number of electors based on its population size.\n3. The winner of the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes (except in Maine and Nebraska, which is not mentioned in the transcript).\n4. The Electoral College system can lead to a situation where the winner of the popular vote does not win the presidency.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. A presidential candidate would focus on winning states with a large number of electoral votes, such as California, Texas, Florida, and New York.\n2. A candidate would also focus on winning swing states, such as Ohio and Florida, which have historically voted for both Democratic and Republican candidates.\n3. A candidate would need to balance their campaign efforts between large and small states to win the necessary 270 electoral votes.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. The relationship between the number of electors and the population size of each state.\n2. The contrast between the interests of large and small states in the Electoral College system.\n3. The potential for a candidate to win the popular vote but not the presidency due to the Electoral College system.\n4. The impact of the census on the number of electors for each state.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. The Electoral College system is a balance between the interests of large and small states, but it can also lead to a situation where the winner of the popular vote does not win the presidency.\n2. A candidate's strategy would need to take into account the number of electors in each state, the population size of each state, and the voting history of each state.\n3. The Electoral College system can lead to a situation where a candidate focuses on winning a few key states rather than appealing to voters across the country.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. The fairness of the Electoral College system, particularly with regards to the potential for a candidate to win the popular vote but not the presidency.\n2. The effectiveness of the Electoral College system in balancing the interests of large and small states.\n3. The potential for the Electoral College system to lead to a situation where a candidate ignores the interests of small states or states with few electoral votes."
