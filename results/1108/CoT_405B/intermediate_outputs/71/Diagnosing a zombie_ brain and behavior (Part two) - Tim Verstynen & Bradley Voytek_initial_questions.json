Which of the following approaches would be most effective?\n    - A: Conducting brain imaging studies on healthy individuals\n    - B: Studying individuals with brain lesions or damage to the Papez circuit\n    - C: Analyzing data from animal studies\n    - D: Conducting a literature review of existing research\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis:**\n1) What is the relationship between the amygdala and aggressive behavior?\n    - A: The amygdala is only involved in suppressing aggressive behaviors\n    - B: The amygdala is only involved in promoting aggressive behaviors\n    - C: The amygdala has both parts that can promote and suppress aggressive behaviors\n    - D: The amygdala has no role in aggressive behavior\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the primary difference between correlational and causal evidence in neuroscience research?\n    - A: Correlational evidence is obtained through experiments, while causal evidence is obtained through observations\n    - B: Correlational evidence shows a cause-and-effect relationship, while causal evidence shows a correlation\n    - C: Correlational evidence shows a correlation, while causal evidence shows a cause-and-effect relationship\n    - D: Correlational evidence is obtained through brain imaging studies, while causal evidence is obtained through behavioral studies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis:**\n1) Combining knowledge of the amygdala and hippocampus, what can be inferred about the behavior of an individual with damage to both structures?\n    - A: They would experience increased aggression and improved memory\n    - B: They would experience decreased aggression and impaired memory\n    - C: They would experience increased aggression and impaired memory\n    - D: They would experience decreased aggression and improved memory\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Integrating concepts of neuroscience research, what hypothesis can be formed about the aggression and memory deficits in an individual with damage to the Papez circuit?\n    - A: The individual's aggression is caused by damage to the hippocampus\n    - B: The individual's memory deficits are caused by damage to the amygdala\n    - C: The individual's aggression and memory deficits are caused by damage to the Papez circuit, which disrupts the connection between the amygdala and hippocampus\n    - D: The individual's aggression and memory deficits are caused by damage to other brain regions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation:**\n1) Critique the assumption that an individual's aggression is inherently linked to their brain structure. Which of the following statements is a valid criticism?\n    - A: The assumption is too simplistic and neglects the role of environmental factors\n    - B: The assumption is too complex and neglects the role of genetics\n    - C: The assumption is supported by a large body of evidence and is therefore valid\n    - D: The assumption is irrelevant to understanding human behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Evaluate the validity of using brain imaging studies to understand an individual's behavior. Which of the following statements is a valid limitation?\n    - A: Brain imaging studies can directly measure an individual's thoughts and feelings\n    - B: Brain imaging studies can only measure correlations between brain activity and behavior\n    - C: Brain imaging studies are only useful for understanding group differences, not individual differences\n    - D: Brain imaging studies are only useful for understanding cognitive processes, not emotional processes\n[Correct answer]: B"
