Which enzyme would be most relevant to their condition?\n    - A: Amylase\n    - B: Protease\n    - C: Lipase\n    - D: Cellulase\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A person with a digestive issue requires a diet that is low in fatty acids. Which enzyme would be most relevant to their dietary needs?\n    - A: Amylase\n    - B: Protease\n    - C: Lipase\n    - D: Lactase\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis**:\n1) What is the relationship between enzyme activity and pH values in the stomach and small intestine?\n    - A: Enzyme activity is highest in acidic conditions and lowest in alkaline conditions\n    - B: Enzyme activity is highest in alkaline conditions and lowest in acidic conditions\n    - C: Enzyme activity is unaffected by pH values\n    - D: Enzyme activity is highest in neutral conditions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the release of bile and the creation of alkaline conditions in the small intestine?\n    - A: The release of bile causes the creation of acidic conditions\n    - B: The release of bile has no effect on pH values\n    - C: The release of bile causes the creation of alkaline conditions\n    - D: The release of bile is caused by the creation of alkaline conditions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**:\n1) A researcher wants to develop a new treatment for a digestive disorder that affects the breakdown of starches. Which combination of knowledge would be most relevant to their research?\n    - A: Enzyme activity and pH values\n    - B: Nutrition and digestive system function\n    - C: Amylase activity and alkaline conditions\n    - D: Protease activity and acidic conditions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) A healthcare professional wants to create a personalized diet for a patient with a digestive issue. Which combination of knowledge would be most relevant to their work?\n    - A: Enzyme activity and pH values\n    - B: Nutrition and digestive system function\n    - C: Amylase activity and alkaline conditions\n    - D: Lipase activity and acidic conditions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**:\n1) Which of the following statements is a valid assessment of the effectiveness of different digestive enzymes?\n    - A: Amylase is more effective than protease in breaking down proteins\n    - B: Protease is more effective than lipase in breaking down fatty acids\n    - C: Amylase is more effective than lipase in breaking down starches\n    - D: Lipase is more effective than amylase in breaking down proteins\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which of the following statements is a valid justification for the importance of bile in creating alkaline conditions in the small intestine?\n    - A: Bile is necessary for the breakdown of proteins\n    - B: Bile is necessary for the creation of acidic conditions\n    - C: Bile is necessary for the activation of digestive enzymes\n    - D: Bile is necessary for the absorption of nutrients\n[Correct answer]: C"
