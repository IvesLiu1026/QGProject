    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which enzyme is responsible for breaking down starch into sugars in the digestive system?\n    - A: Protease\n    - B: Lipase\n    - C: Amylase\n    - D: Cellulase\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Where is bile produced and stored in the digestive system?\n    - A: Pancreas and small intestine\n    - B: Liver and gallbladder\n    - C: Stomach and pancreas\n    - D: Saliva gland and small intestine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of enzymes in the digestive system?\n    - A: To produce hormones that regulate digestion\n    - B: To break down food molecules into smaller soluble ones\n    - C: To absorb nutrients from food\n    - D: To eliminate waste products\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why does the stomach produce hydrochloric acid?\n    - A: To create alkaline conditions for enzyme activity\n    - B: To begin digestion and kill harmful microorganisms\n    - C: To produce digestive enzymes\n    - D: To store bile\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A patient has a digestive disorder that affects their ability to break down proteins. Which enzyme would be most relevant to their condition?\n    - A: Amylase\n    - B: Protease\n    - C: Lipase\n    - D: Cellulase\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A person with a digestive issue requires a diet that is low in fatty acids. Which enzyme would be most relevant to their dietary needs?\n    - A: Amylase\n    - B: Protease\n    - C: Lipase\n    - D: Lactase\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How do pH values affect enzyme activity in the stomach and small intestine?\n    - A: Enzyme activity is highest in acidic conditions and lowest in alkaline conditions\n    - B: Enzyme activity is highest in alkaline conditions and lowest in acidic conditions\n    - C: Enzyme activity is unaffected by pH values\n    - D: Enzyme activity is highest in neutral conditions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the effect of bile release on pH values in the small intestine?\n    - A: The release of bile causes the creation of acidic conditions\n    - B: The release of bile has no effect on pH values\n    - C: The release of bile causes the creation of alkaline conditions\n    - D: The release of bile is caused by the creation of alkaline conditions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) A researcher wants to develop a new treatment for a digestive disorder that affects the breakdown of starches. Which combination of knowledge would be most relevant to their research?\n    - A: Enzyme activity and pH values\n    - B: Nutrition and digestive system function\n    - C: Amylase activity and alkaline conditions\n    - D: Protease activity and acidic conditions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) A healthcare professional wants to create a personalized diet for a patient with a digestive issue. Which combination of knowledge would be most relevant to their work?\n    - A: Enzyme activity and pH values\n    - B: Nutrition and digestive system function\n    - C: Amylase activity and alkaline conditions\n    - D: Lipase activity and acidic conditions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Which statement accurately compares the effectiveness of different digestive enzymes?\n    - A: Amylase is more effective than protease in breaking down proteins\n    - B: Protease is more effective than lipase in breaking down fatty acids\n    - C: Amylase is more effective than lipase in breaking down starches\n    - D: Lipase is more effective than amylase in breaking down proteins\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is bile important for creating alkaline conditions in the small intestine?\n    - A: Bile is necessary for the breakdown of proteins\n    - B: Bile is necessary for the creation of acidic conditions\n    - C: Bile is necessary for the activation of digestive enzymes\n    - D: Bile is necessary for the absorption of nutrients\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo significant changes were made to the questions, but minor adjustments were made to improve clarity and concision. The distractors remain plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
