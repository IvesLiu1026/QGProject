    "content_analysis": "**Bloom's Taxonomy Analysis:**\n\n**1. Knowledge:**\n\n- The amygdala is a small almond-shaped area deep in the brain.\n- Stimulating the amygdala can lead to aggressive or predatory behaviors.\n- The amygdala is part of the Papez circuit.\n- The Papez circuit was discovered by James Papez.\n- The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped area that is needed to turn short-term memories into long-term memories.\n- The amygdala and hippocampus are physically connected.\n- Patient H.M. had both his left and right hippocampuses removed to treat his epilepsy.\n- Brain imaging studies have shown that some brain regions are more active when people are angry.\n\n**2. Comprehension:**\n\n- The concept of correlational evidence versus causal evidence in neuroscience research.\n- The importance of working with people with brain lesions and brain simulation studies in neuroscience.\n- The idea that the amygdala is involved in aggressive or predatory behaviors, but also has parts that can suppress these behaviors.\n- The connection between the amygdala and hippocampus in linking emotion and memory together.\n\n**3. Application:**\n\n- Using the knowledge of the amygdala and hippocampus to understand the behavior of the zombie.\n- Applying the concept of the Papez circuit to explain the zombie's aggression and memory deficits.\n- Using the example of Patient H.M. to illustrate the importance of the hippocampus in memory formation.\n\n**4. Analysis:**\n\n- The relationship between the amygdala and aggressive behavior.\n- The contrast between correlational and causal evidence in neuroscience research.\n- The cause-and-effect connection between the amygdala and hippocampus in linking emotion and memory together.\n- The comparison between the zombie's behavior and the effects of brain lesions or stimulation in humans and animals.\n\n**5. Synthesis:**\n\n- Combining the knowledge of the amygdala and hippocampus to form a new understanding of the zombie's behavior.\n- Integrating the concepts of neuroscience research to develop a hypothesis about the zombie's aggression and memory deficits.\n- Using the example of Patient H.M. to inform the understanding of the zombie's memory deficits.\n\n**6. Evaluation:**\n\n- Critiquing the assumption that the zombie's aggression is inherently linked to its brain structure.\n- Evaluating the validity of using brain imaging studies to understand the zombie's behavior.\n- Justifying the use of the Papez circuit to explain the zombie's aggression and memory deficits.\n- Assessing the ethics of experimenting on the zombie to test the hypothesis."
