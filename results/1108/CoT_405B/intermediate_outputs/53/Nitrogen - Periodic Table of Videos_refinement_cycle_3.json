Which of the following would be a suitable choice?\n    - A: Liquid Oxygen\n    - B: Liquid Nitrogen\n    - C: Liquid Helium\n    - D: Liquid Hydrogen\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A researcher wants to reshape an eye lens in a medical procedure. Which of the following could be used to achieve this?\n    - A: Liquid Nitrogen\n    - B: Liquid Oxygen\n    - C: Laser technology\n    - D: Ultrasonic waves\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How does the strong bond between Nitrogen atoms contribute to its role in explosive compounds?\n    - A: Decreases utility\n    - B: Increases utility due to energy release when bonds form\n    - C: No impact\n    - D: Slightly increases utility\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the reactivity of Nitrogen compare to that of Oxygen in laboratory settings?\n    - A: Nitrogen is more reactive than Oxygen\n    - B: Nitrogen is less reactive than Oxygen\n    - C: Nitrogen and Oxygen have similar reactivity\n    - D: Nitrogen's reactivity is not comparable to Oxygen's\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a potential hazard associated with handling Liquid Nitrogen in a laboratory?\n    - A: Explosions due to high reactivity\n    - B: Burns due to extremely low temperature\n    - C: Contamination due to high purity\n    - D: Equipment damage due to low viscosity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a potential benefit of using Nitrogen in medical procedures?\n    - A: It can cause unwanted reactions with air\n    - B: It can lead to the creation of explosive compounds\n    - C: It can provide a safe and effective means of freezing and reshaping tissues\n    - D: It can increase the risk of contamination\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more significant refinements are needed, but minor adjustments have been made to improve clarity and concision."
