    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of container is typically used to store Liquid Nitrogen due to its extremely low temperature?\n    - A: A glass beaker\n    - B: A dewar tank\n    - C: A metal flask\n    - D: A plastic bottle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) At what temperature does Liquid Nitrogen boil in degrees Centigrade?\n    - A: -100\n    - B: -196\n    - C: 0\n    - D: 100\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why is Nitrogen often preferred over Oxygen in laboratory settings?\n    - A: Nitrogen is more reactive than Oxygen\n    - B: Nitrogen is less expensive than Oxygen\n    - C: Nitrogen is less reactive than Oxygen, reducing unwanted reactions\n    - D: Nitrogen has a higher boiling point than Oxygen\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is a significant consequence of the strong bond between Nitrogen atoms?\n    - A: High reactivity\n    - B: Utility in explosive compounds due to energy release when bonds form\n    - C: Poor cooling properties\n    - D: Good heat conduction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A laboratory experiment requires a coolant that can rapidly freeze materials. Which of the following would be a suitable choice?\n    - A: Liquid Oxygen\n    - B: Liquid Nitrogen\n    - C: Liquid Helium\n    - D: Liquid Hydrogen\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A researcher wants to reshape an eye lens in a medical procedure. Which of the following could be used to achieve this?\n    - A: Liquid Nitrogen\n    - B: Liquid Oxygen\n    - C: Laser technology\n    - D: Ultrasonic waves\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How does the strong bond between Nitrogen atoms contribute to its role in explosive compounds?\n    - A: Decreases utility\n    - B: Increases utility due to energy release when bonds form\n    - C: No impact\n    - D: Slightly increases utility\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the reactivity of Nitrogen compare to that of Oxygen in laboratory settings?\n    - A: Nitrogen is more reactive than Oxygen\n    - B: Nitrogen is less reactive than Oxygen\n    - C: Nitrogen and Oxygen have similar reactivity\n    - D: Nitrogen's reactivity is not comparable to Oxygen's\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a potential hazard associated with handling Liquid Nitrogen in a laboratory?\n    - A: Explosions due to high reactivity\n    - B: Burns or frostbite due to extremely low temperature\n    - C: Contamination due to high purity\n    - D: Equipment damage due to low viscosity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a potential benefit of using Nitrogen in medical procedures?\n    - A: It can cause unwanted reactions with air\n    - B: It can lead to the creation of explosive compounds\n    - C: It can provide a safe and effective means of freezing and reshaping tissues\n    - D: It can increase the risk of contamination\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nThese refined questions align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. The correct answers are accurate and consistent with the provided transcript."
