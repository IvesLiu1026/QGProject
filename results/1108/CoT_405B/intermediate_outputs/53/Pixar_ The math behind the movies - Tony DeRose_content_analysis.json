    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n- Pixar uses math extensively in their film production.\n- Coordinate geometry is used to bridge the gap between artists/designers and computers.\n- Coordinate systems use x for horizontal positioning and y for vertical positioning.\n- Translation (movement) can be represented mathematically using addition.\n- Scaling (resizing) can be represented mathematically using multiplication.\n- Rotation can be represented mathematically using trigonometry.\n- Trigonometry is used to calculate the height of objects.\n- Midpoints are used to create smooth curves and surfaces.\n- Subdivision (split and average) is used to create smooth curves and surfaces.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n- Math is used to describe the position and movement of characters in Pixar films.\n- Artists and designers think in terms of shape and images, while computers think in terms of numbers and equations.\n- Coordinate geometry helps to translate between these two worlds.\n- The concept of midpoints can be used to create smooth curves and surfaces.\n- Subdivision is a process of repeatedly splitting and averaging points to create smooth curves and surfaces.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n- Using coordinate geometry to animate characters in a film.\n- Applying trigonometry to calculate the height of objects in a scene.\n- Using subdivision to create smooth curves and surfaces for character models.\n- Animating characters by moving the original points of a subdivision surface.\n- Using linear algebra, differential calculus, and integral calculus in film production.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and contrasts)**\n\n- The relationship between coordinate geometry and the movement of characters in Pixar films.\n- The contrast between how artists/designers think (shapes and images) and how computers think (numbers and equations).\n- The connection between midpoints and the creation of smooth curves and surfaces.\n- The relationship between subdivision and the creation of smooth curves and surfaces.\n\n**Synthesis (New understanding)**\n\n- Combining coordinate geometry and trigonometry to create complex animations.\n- Using subdivision to create detailed and realistic character models.\n- Integrating math concepts (e.g., linear algebra, differential calculus, integral calculus) to create realistic and engaging film scenes.\n- Applying the concept of midpoints to other areas of film production, such as special effects or lighting.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n- Evaluating the effectiveness of using coordinate geometry and trigonometry in film production.\n- Critiquing the use of subdivision in creating character models and animations.\n- Justifying the importance of math in film production and its impact on the final product.\n- Assessing the limitations and potential drawbacks of using math in film production."
