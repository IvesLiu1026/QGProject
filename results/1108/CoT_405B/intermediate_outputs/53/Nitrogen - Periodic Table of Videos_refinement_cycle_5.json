    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of container is typically used to store Liquid Nitrogen due to its extremely low temperature?\n    - A: A thermally insulated flask\n    - B: A dewar tank\n    - C: A metal flask with a loose lid\n    - D: A plastic bottle with a tight seal\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) At what temperature does Liquid Nitrogen boil in degrees Centigrade?\n    - A: -100\n    - B: -196\n    - C: 0\n    - D: 100\n[Correct answer]: B (No change needed)\n\n3) Why is Nitrogen often preferred over Oxygen in laboratory settings?\n    - A: Nitrogen is more reactive than Oxygen\n    - B: Nitrogen is less expensive than Oxygen\n    - C: Nitrogen is less reactive than Oxygen, reducing unwanted reactions\n    - D: Nitrogen has a higher boiling point than Oxygen\n[Correct answer]: C (No change needed)\n\n4) What is a significant consequence of the strong bond between Nitrogen atoms?\n    - A: High reactivity\n    - B: Utility in explosive compounds due to energy release when bonds form\n    - C: Poor cooling properties\n    - D: Good heat conduction\n[Correct answer]: B (No change needed)\n\n5) A laboratory experiment requires a coolant that can rapidly freeze materials. Which of the following would be a suitable choice?\n    - A: Liquid Oxygen\n    - B: Liquid Nitrogen\n    - C: Liquid Helium\n    - D: Liquid Hydrogen\n[Correct answer]: B (No change needed)\n\n6) A researcher wants to reshape an eye lens in a medical procedure. Which of the following could be used to achieve this?\n    - A: Liquid Nitrogen\n    - B: Liquid Oxygen\n    - C: Laser technology\n    - D: Ultrasonic waves\n[Correct answer]: A (No change needed)\n\n7) How does the strong bond between Nitrogen atoms contribute to its role in explosive compounds?\n    - A: Decreases utility\n    - B: Increases utility due to energy release when bonds form\n    - C: No impact\n    - D: Slightly increases utility\n[Correct answer]: B (No change needed)\n\n8) How does the reactivity of Nitrogen compare to that of Oxygen in laboratory settings?\n    - A: Nitrogen is more reactive than Oxygen\n    - B: Nitrogen is less reactive than Oxygen\n    - C: Nitrogen and Oxygen have similar reactivity\n    - D: Nitrogen's reactivity is not comparable to Oxygen's\n[Correct answer]: B (No change needed)\n\n9) What is a potential hazard associated with handling Liquid Nitrogen in a laboratory?\n    - A: Explosions due to high reactivity\n    - B: Burns or frostbite due to extremely low temperature\n    - C: Contamination due to high purity\n    - D: Equipment damage due to low viscosity\n[Correct answer]: B (No change needed)\n\n10) What is a potential benefit of using Nitrogen in medical procedures?\n    - A: It can cause unwanted reactions with air\n    - B: It can lead to the creation of explosive compounds\n    - C: It can provide a safe and effective means of freezing and reshaping tissues\n    - D: It can increase the risk of contamination\n[Correct answer]: C (No change needed)\n\nMost of the initial questions were already well-written and aligned with the key concepts in the transcript. However, I made some minor adjustments to question 1 to improve clarity and conciseness. The remaining questions did not require any further refinement."
