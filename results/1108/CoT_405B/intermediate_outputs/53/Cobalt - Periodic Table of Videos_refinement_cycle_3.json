    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What property of cobalt sponge makes it useful for catalytic reactions?\n    - A: High density\n    - B: Low surface area\n    - C: Large surface area\n    - D: High melting point\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) In which region of the world is cobalt mined, according to the transcript?\n    - A: Katanga region of Asia\n    - B: Katanga region of Africa\n    - C: South America\n    - D: Australia\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why is cobalt used in the production of magnets for color televisions and loudspeakers?\n    - A: Due to its high melting point\n    - B: Due to its low density\n    - C: Due to its magnetic properties\n    - D: Due to its low cost\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is a potential use of cobalt sponge in industrial applications?\n    - A: As a catalyst in hydrogenation reactions\n    - B: As a component in the production of semiconductors\n    - C: As a material in the construction of buildings\n    - D: As a fuel source in power plants\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) How did the cobalt shortage in the 1970s affect the production of color televisions?\n    - A: The shortage had no effect on production\n    - B: The shortage increased production\n    - C: The shortage stopped production for some time\n    - D: The shortage led to the development of new technologies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a benefit of using cobalt in magnets for color televisions and loudspeakers?\n    - A: It allows for larger magnets to be used\n    - B: It allows for smaller magnets to be used\n    - C: It reduces the weight of the magnets\n    - D: It increases the cost of the magnets\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How do cobalt's magnetic properties make it suitable for use in color televisions and loudspeakers?\n    - A: They allow for larger magnets to be used\n    - B: They allow for smaller magnets to be used, reducing interference with electron guns\n    - C: They reduce the weight of the magnets\n    - D: They increase the cost of the magnets\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a potential application of a new system that integrates cobalt's catalytic properties with its magnetic properties?\n    - A: In the production of new fuels for vehicles\n    - B: In the development of new materials for construction\n    - C: In the creation of more efficient hydrogenation reactions\n    - D: In the manufacture of medical equipment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 9-12 as they were not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript or were duplicates of previous questions. I also rephrased some questions to enhance clarity and conciseness, and confirmed that the distractors are plausible but incorrect."
