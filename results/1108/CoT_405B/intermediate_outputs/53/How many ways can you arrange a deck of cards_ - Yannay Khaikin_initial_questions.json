How many possible arrangements are there?\n    - A: 10\n    - B: 20\n    - C: 100\n    - D: 120\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) A deck of cards is shuffled, and the order of the cards is changed. What mathematical concept is used to calculate the number of possible arrangements?\n    - A: Combinations\n    - B: Permutations\n    - C: Factorials\n    - D: Probability\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the number of objects and the number of possible arrangements?\n    - A: As the number of objects increases, the number of possible arrangements decreases\n    - B: As the number of objects increases, the number of possible arrangements remains the same\n    - C: As the number of objects increases, the number of possible arrangements increases exponentially\n    - D: As the number of objects decreases, the number of possible arrangements increases\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is notable about the number of possible arrangements of 52 cards?\n    - A: It is relatively small compared to the number of cards\n    - B: It is extremely large compared to the number of cards\n    - C: It is equal to the number of cards\n    - D: It is unknown\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) A music teacher wants to arrange 6 students in a row to perform a musical piece. If the teacher wants to create a unique arrangement for each performance, what mathematical concept can be used to calculate the number of possible arrangements?\n    - A: Combinations\n    - B: Permutations\n    - C: Factorials\n    - D: Probability\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A computer programmer wants to generate a unique password for each user. If the programmer wants to use a combination of 8 characters, what mathematical concept can be used to calculate the number of possible arrangements?\n    - A: Combinations\n    - B: Permutations\n    - C: Factorials\n    - D: Probability\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) What is the significance of the number of possible arrangements of 52 cards (8.07 x 10^67)?\n    - A: It is a relatively small number that can be easily calculated\n    - B: It is an extremely large number that makes it unlikely to have two identical arrangements\n    - C: It is an unknown number that cannot be calculated\n    - D: It is a number that has no practical significance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Is it reasonable to assume that a well-shuffled deck of cards is likely to be a unique arrangement that has never existed before?\n    - A: No, because the number of possible arrangements is relatively small\n    - B: Yes, because the number of possible arrangements is extremely large\n    - C: Maybe, because the number of possible arrangements is unknown\n    - D: No, because the number of possible arrangements is irrelevant\n[Correct answer]: B"
