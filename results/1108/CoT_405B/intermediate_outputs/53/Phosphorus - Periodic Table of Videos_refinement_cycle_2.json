    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Why is phosphorus typically stored under water?\n    - A: To slow down its reaction rate\n    - B: To increase its reactivity\n    - C: To reduce its energy-producing capabilities\n    - D: To prevent it from reacting with oxygen and causing a fire\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) Approximately how much ATP is produced by the average person per day?\n    - A: 1 kilo\n    - B: 10 kilos\n    - C: 50 kilos\n    - D: 70 kilos\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What makes phosphorus a highly reactive element?\n    - A: Its high melting point\n    - B: Its stable molecular structure\n    - C: Its ability to conduct electricity\n    - D: Its strained molecular structure, which makes it prone to oxidation reactions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What is the primary role of phosphorus in the human body?\n    - A: To produce proteins\n    - B: To produce carbohydrates\n    - C: To produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy-producing molecule\n    - D: To produce fats\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is the primary use of white phosphorus in phosphorus bombs?\n    - A: To produce a loud noise\n    - B: To produce a strong odor\n    - C: To produce a large amount of heat\n    - D: To produce an intense white light\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) Which type of phosphorus is used in the heads of non-safety matches?\n    - A: White phosphorus\n    - B: Black phosphorus\n    - C: Red phosphorus\n    - D: Yellow phosphorus\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) Why do different allotropes of phosphorus have varying levels of reactivity?\n    - A: Due to their different colors\n    - B: Due to their different textures\n    - C: Due to their molecular structures\n    - D: Due to their different densities\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the relationship between the reactivity of phosphorus and its molecular structure?\n    - A: The reactivity of phosphorus is not related to its molecular structure\n    - B: The reactivity of phosphorus is related to its molecular structure, but only in certain conditions\n    - C: The reactivity of phosphorus is related to its molecular structure, but only at high temperatures\n    - D: The reactivity of phosphorus is related to its strained molecular structure, making it prone to oxidation reactions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What is the result of combining phosphorus and oxygen?\n    - A: A slow and controlled reaction\n    - B: A highly reactive and intense white light\n    - C: A loud noise and a strong odor\n    - D: A large amount of heat and a bright color\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the importance of phosphorus in the human body, particularly in the production of ATP?\n    - A: It is not essential for energy production\n    - B: It is only essential for energy production in certain conditions\n    - C: It is essential for energy production and can be studied using magnetic resonance imaging\n    - D: It is only essential for energy production at high temperatures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a concern about the use of phosphorus in phosphorus bombs?\n    - A: Its potential to produce a large amount of energy\n    - B: Its potential to produce a loud noise\n    - C: Its safety and potential harm to humans and the environment\n    - D: Its potential to produce a strong odor\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What precaution should be taken when handling phosphorus?\n    - A: Wear protective gloves to prevent skin contact\n    - B: Store it in a well-ventilated area to prevent inhalation\n    - C: Handle it with bare hands to increase reactivity\n    - D: All of the above, including storing it under water to prevent reaction with oxygen\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI removed question 13 as it was a duplicate of question 1. I also made minor adjustments to the wording of some questions to improve clarity and concision. Additionally, I revised some of the distractors to make them more plausible but incorrect."
