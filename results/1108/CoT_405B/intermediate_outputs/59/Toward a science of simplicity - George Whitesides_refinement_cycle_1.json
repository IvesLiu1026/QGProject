    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who is quoted by the speaker as saying \"I know it when I see it\" in reference to pornography?\n    - A: Justice Potter Stewart\n    - B: Albert Einstein\n    - C: Steve Jobs\n    - D: Leonardo da Vinci\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What thought experiment illustrates the complexity of answering a simple question about why water is hot in a teapot?\n    - A: The Coffee Cup Problem\n    - B: The Teapot Problem\n    - C: The Cell Phone Problem\n    - D: The Birth Control Pill Problem\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) According to the speaker, what are the key characteristics of simplicity?\n    - A: Predictability, reliability, and high cost\n    - B: Unpredictability, unreliability, and low cost\n    - C: Predictability, reliability, and low cost\n    - D: Complexity, simplicity, and cost\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the speaker's argument about the US healthcare system?\n    - A: It is fundamentally sound and simplicity is not needed\n    - B: It is fundamentally broken and simplicity can be used to create a more effective system\n    - C: It is too complex and simplicity is not the solution\n    - D: It is too simple and complexity is needed\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is an example of how simplicity can be used to create complex systems that have a significant impact on society?\n    - A: The paper chip for medical diagnosis\n    - B: The cell phone and birth control pill\n    - C: The coffee cup\n    - D: The teapot\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is an example of how simplicity can be used to create low-cost, reliable solutions for healthcare in developing countries?\n    - A: The cell phone\n    - B: The birth control pill\n    - C: The paper chip for medical diagnosis\n    - D: The coffee cup\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What are the component parts of simplicity, according to the speaker?\n    - A: Predictability, reliability, and high cost\n    - B: Unpredictability, unreliability, and low cost\n    - C: Predictability, reliability, and low cost\n    - D: Complexity, simplicity, and cost\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the speaker's analysis of the relationship between simplicity and complexity?\n    - A: Simplicity is just the absence of complexity\n    - B: Simplicity is a quality that can be designed and engineered, and is not just the absence of complexity\n    - C: Complexity is just the absence of simplicity\n    - D: Simplicity and complexity are unrelated\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the speaker's suggestion about the use of simplicity in healthcare?\n    - A: It can only be used to create complex systems\n    - B: It can only be used to create low-cost, reliable solutions for healthcare in developing countries\n    - C: It can be used to create a more effective and efficient US healthcare system\n    - D: It is not applicable to healthcare\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the speaker's evaluation of the intellectual merit of simplicity?\n    - A: It lies in its ability to create complex systems\n    - B: It lies in its ability to create systems that are unpredictable, unreliable, and high-cost\n    - C: It lies in its ability to create systems that are predictable, reliable, and low-cost\n    - D: It is not intellectually meritorious\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were redundant and not adding any new information.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
