    "content_analysis": "Here's the analysis of the transcript based on Bloom's Taxonomy:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1. The film \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.\n2. The main character, Benjamin Button, is played by Brad Pitt and is completely computer-generated from the neck up for nearly the first hour of the film.\n3. The film's director, David Fincher, wanted the main character to be played by one actor from cradle to grave.\n4. The visual effects team created a digital human head that could perform various actions, such as walking, running, and delivering dialogue.\n5. The team used a technology called Contour to capture the subtleties of the human face.\n6. The team created a database of thousands of shapes to capture the possibilities of Brad Pitt's face.\n7. The film's production involved 155 people and took over two years to complete.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The film's storyline involves a man who is born old and lives his life in reverse.\n2. The visual effects team had to create a digital human head that could hold up under various conditions, such as daylight, nighttime, and close-ups.\n3. The team used a combination of technologies, including motion capture and Contour, to capture the subtleties of the human face.\n4. The team had to create a lighting system to match the lighting of the real-world environments.\n5. The team had to create an eye system, mouth system, and skin displacement system to make the digital human head look realistic.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. The technology used in the film could be applied to other industries, such as video games or medical imaging.\n2. The team's approach to creating a digital human head could be used in other film productions.\n3. The use of Contour technology could be applied to other fields, such as psychology or sociology, to study human behavior and emotions.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The team's decision to abort using motion capture technology and instead use Contour technology was a turning point in the production process.\n2. The team's approach to creating a digital human head involved breaking down the problem into smaller pieces and attacking each one individually.\n3. The team's use of a database of thousands of shapes to capture the possibilities of Brad Pitt's face allowed for a more realistic and nuanced performance.\n4. The team's creation of a lighting system, eye system, mouth system, and skin displacement system all contributed to the overall realism of the digital human head.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The team's combination of technologies, including Contour and motion capture, resulted in a new approach to creating digital human heads.\n2. The team's use of a database of thousands of shapes to capture the possibilities of Brad Pitt's face could be applied to other areas of film production, such as creating digital characters or creatures.\n3. The team's approach to creating a digital human head could be used in other industries, such as video games or virtual reality, to create more realistic and immersive experiences.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The team's decision to use Contour technology instead of motion capture technology was a good choice, as it allowed for a more realistic and nuanced performance.\n2. The team's approach to creating a digital human head was successful, as it resulted in a realistic and believable character.\n3. The team's use of a database of thousands of shapes to capture the possibilities of Brad Pitt's face was a good decision, as it allowed for a more realistic and nuanced performance.\n4. The team's creation of a lighting system, eye system, mouth system, and skin displacement system all contributed to the overall realism of the digital human head, and were therefore good decisions."
