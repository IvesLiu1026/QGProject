What should they consider when designing the molecule?\n    - A: Only the chemical formula\n    - B: Only the electron configuration\n    - C: Both the chemical formula and electron configuration\n    - D: Neither the chemical formula nor electron configuration\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the arrangement of nuclei and electrons and the shape of a molecule?\n    - A: The arrangement of nuclei and electrons has no effect on the shape of a molecule\n    - B: The arrangement of nuclei and electrons determines the shape of a molecule\n    - C: The arrangement of nuclei determines the shape of a molecule, but electrons have no effect\n    - D: The arrangement of electrons determines the shape of a molecule, but nuclei have no effect\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How does the repulsion of like charges affect the arrangement of atoms in a molecule?\n    - A: It causes the atoms to move closer together\n    - B: It causes the atoms to move farther apart\n    - C: It has no effect on the arrangement of atoms\n    - D: It causes the atoms to rotate around each other\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) A molecule has the chemical formula C2H6. Using your knowledge of electron configurations and chemical formulas, predict its molecular shape.\n    - A: Tetrahedral\n    - B: Trigonal pyramidal\n    - C: Bent\n    - D: Straight line\n[Correct answer]: A (Note: This question requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge of electron configurations and chemical formulas to predict the molecular shape.)\n\n2) A company wants to design a new molecule with specific properties. How can they use their understanding of molecular shape and chemical properties to achieve this goal?\n    - A: By ignoring molecular shape and focusing only on chemical properties\n    - B: By considering only the chemical formula and ignoring molecular shape\n    - C: By integrating their understanding of molecular shape and chemical properties\n    - D: By using trial and error to design the molecule\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) What is a limitation of predicting molecular shapes based on electron configurations and chemical formulas?\n    - A: It is always 100% accurate\n    - B: It is only accurate for simple molecules\n    - C: It does not take into account the effects of external factors\n    - D: It is only accurate for molecules with a specific shape\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is experimental verification of predicted molecular shapes important?\n    - A: Because predictions are always 100% accurate\n    - B: Because predictions are only accurate for simple molecules\n    - C: Because predictions may not take into account all factors that affect molecular shape\n    - D: Because predictions are unnecessary\n[Correct answer]: C"
