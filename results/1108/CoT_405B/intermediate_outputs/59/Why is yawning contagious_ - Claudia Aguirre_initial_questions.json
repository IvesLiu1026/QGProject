    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level based on the provided content analysis:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is the term for the phenomenon where people yawn when they see or hear someone else yawn?\n    - A: Social yawning\n    - B: Contagious yawning\n    - C: Empathy yawning\n    - D: Reflex yawning\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) At what age do children typically start exhibiting contagious yawning?\n    - A: 1-2 years old\n    - B: 4-5 years old\n    - C: 7-8 years old\n    - D: 10-11 years old\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) Which of the following statements best describes the role of mirror neurons in contagious yawning?\n    - A: Mirror neurons are responsible for triggering a reflex-like response to yawning.\n    - B: Mirror neurons enable people to learn, empathize, and understand others' emotions.\n    - C: Mirror neurons are only involved in the physiological hypotheses of contagious yawning.\n    - D: Mirror neurons are only involved in the psychological hypotheses of contagious yawning.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the main difference between the fixed action pattern and non-conscious mimicry hypotheses of contagious yawning?\n    - A: The fixed action pattern hypothesis suggests a conscious imitation of behavior, while the non-conscious mimicry hypothesis suggests an unconscious imitation.\n    - B: The fixed action pattern hypothesis suggests a reflex-like response, while the non-conscious mimicry hypothesis suggests an unconscious imitation of behavior.\n    - C: The fixed action pattern hypothesis suggests a physiological explanation, while the non-conscious mimicry hypothesis suggests a psychological explanation.\n    - D: The fixed action pattern hypothesis suggests a psychological explanation, while the non-conscious mimicry hypothesis suggests a physiological explanation.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) How can understanding contagious yawning inform teaching methods and social skills training?\n    - A: By highlighting the importance of empathy in social interactions and relationships.\n    - B: By recognizing the role of mirror neurons in learning and empathy.\n    - C: By demonstrating the need for more research on contagious yawning.\n    - D: By showing that contagious yawning is only relevant in social psychology studies.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) In what context can contagious yawning be used as a tool to study empathy and social behavior?\n    - A: Only in autism research.\n    - B: Only in social psychology studies.\n    - C: In various contexts, such as in autism research or social psychology studies.\n    - D: In no context, as it is not a relevant phenomenon.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What does the relationship between mirror neurons and contagious yawning suggest about our brains?\n    - A: That our brains are wired to respond only to physiological stimuli.\n    - B: That our brains are wired to respond only to psychological stimuli.\n    - C: That our brains are wired to respond to others' emotions and behaviors.\n    - D: That our brains are not wired to respond to others' emotions and behaviors.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What does the contrast between physiological and psychological hypotheses of contagious yawning highlight?\n    - A: The simplicity of the phenomenon.\n    - B: The complexity of the phenomenon and the need for further research.\n    - C: The importance of empathy in social interactions and relationships.\n    - D: The role of mirror neurons in learning and empathy.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) What could be the result of combining the fixed action pattern and non-conscious mimicry hypotheses of contagious yawning?\n    - A: A more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon, highlighting both reflex-like and unconscious imitation aspects.\n    - B: A more limited understanding of the phenomenon, highlighting only the reflex-like aspect.\n    - C: A more limited understanding of the phenomenon, highlighting only the unconscious imitation aspect.\n    - D: No new insights into the phenomenon.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What could be the result of integrating the empathy yawn hypothesis with research on emotional intelligence and social skills?\n    - A: New insights into the importance of empathy in relationships and social interactions.\n    - B: A more limited understanding of the phenomenon, highlighting only the physiological aspect.\n    - C: A more limited understanding of the phenomenon, highlighting only the psychological aspect.\n    - D: No new insights into the phenomenon.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) Why is it important to evaluate the strengths and limitations of each hypothesis of contagious yawning?\n    - A: To determine the most promising avenues for further study.\n    - B: To demonstrate the need for more research on the phenomenon.\n    - C: To highlight the importance of empathy in social interactions and relationships.\n    - D: To show that contagious yawning is only relevant in social psychology studies.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the purpose of critiquing the methodology of existing studies on contagious yawning?\n    - A: To inform the design of future experiments and improve the validity of findings.\n    - B: To demonstrate the need for more research on the phenomenon.\n    - C: To highlight the importance of empathy in social interactions and relationships.\n    - D: To show that contagious yawning is only relevant in social psychology studies.\n[Correct answer]: A"
