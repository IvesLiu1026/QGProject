    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible distractors, and accurate correct answers. I removed duplicate questions and rephrased some questions to better assess the understanding of the concepts.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who discovered methane in 1776?\n    - A: Alessandro Volta\n    - B: Antoine Lavoisier\n    - C: Joseph Priestley\n    - D: Humphry Davy\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the chemical formula for methane?\n    - A: CH3\n    - B: CH4\n    - C: C2H6\n    - D: C3H8\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What determines the shape of a molecule?\n    - A: The arrangement of its nuclei and electrons to minimize attraction and maximize repulsion of charges\n    - B: The arrangement of its nuclei and electrons to maximize attraction and minimize repulsion of charges\n    - C: The number of electrons in the outermost energy level\n    - D: The number of protons in the nucleus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What contributes to a molecule's shape from each participating atom?\n    - A: The innermost electrons\n    - B: The outermost electrons\n    - C: The protons in the nucleus\n    - D: The neutrons in the nucleus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A molecule has the chemical formula CH3F. Based on the electron configuration of carbon and the number of hydrogen and fluorine atoms, what shape is it likely to have?\n    - A: Tetrahedral\n    - B: Trigonal pyramidal\n    - C: Bent\n    - D: Straight line\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What factors should be considered when designing a molecule to achieve a specific shape and properties?\n    - A: Only the chemical formula\n    - B: Only the electron configuration\n    - C: Both the chemical formula and electron configuration\n    - D: Neither the chemical formula nor electron configuration\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How does the repulsion of like charges affect the arrangement of atoms in a molecule?\n    - A: It causes the atoms to move closer together\n    - B: It causes the atoms to move farther apart\n    - C: It has no effect on the arrangement of atoms\n    - D: It causes the atoms to rotate around each other\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) A molecule has the chemical formula C2H6. Based on the electron configuration of carbon and the number of hydrogen atoms, what shape is each carbon atom likely to have?\n    - A: Tetrahedral\n    - B: Trigonal pyramidal\n    - C: Bent\n    - D: Straight line\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) How can the understanding of molecular shape and chemical properties be used to design a new molecule with specific properties?\n    - A: By ignoring molecular shape and focusing only on chemical properties\n    - B: By considering only the chemical formula and ignoring molecular shape\n    - C: By integrating the understanding of molecular shape and chemical properties\n    - D: By using trial and error to design the molecule\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) Why is experimental verification of predicted molecular shapes important?\n    - A: Because predictions are always 100% accurate\n    - B: Because predictions are only accurate for simple molecules\n    - C: Because predictions may not take into account all factors that affect molecular shape\n    - D: Because predictions are unnecessary\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a potential limitation of predicting molecular shapes based on electron configurations and chemical formulas?\n    - A: It is always 100% accurate\n    - B: It is only accurate for simple molecules\n    - C: It does not take into account the effects of external factors\n    - D: It is only accurate for molecules with a specific shape\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo further refinement is needed for these 11 questions. The removed questions were either duplicates or did not accurately assess the understanding of the concepts."
