    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the term used to describe the phenomenon where people yawn when they see or hear someone else yawn?\n    - A: Social learning\n    - B: Contagious yawning\n    - C: Empathy response\n    - D: Reflex action\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) At what age do children typically start exhibiting contagious yawning?\n    - A: 1-2 years old\n    - B: 4-5 years old\n    - C: 7-8 years old\n    - D: 10-11 years old\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of mirror neurons in the context of contagious yawning?\n    - A: To regulate physiological responses to yawning\n    - B: To enable people to learn, empathize, and understand others' emotions\n    - C: To trigger a reflex-like response to yawning\n    - D: To suppress yawning in social situations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the main difference between the fixed action pattern and non-conscious mimicry hypotheses of contagious yawning?\n    - A: The fixed action pattern hypothesis suggests a conscious imitation of behavior, while the non-conscious mimicry hypothesis suggests an unconscious imitation.\n    - B: The fixed action pattern hypothesis suggests a reflex-like response, while the non-conscious mimicry hypothesis suggests an unconscious imitation of behavior.\n    - C: The fixed action pattern hypothesis suggests a physiological explanation, while the non-conscious mimicry hypothesis suggests a psychological explanation.\n    - D: The fixed action pattern hypothesis suggests a psychological explanation, while the non-conscious mimicry hypothesis suggests a physiological explanation.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How does understanding contagious yawning inform our understanding of social behavior and relationships?\n    - A: By highlighting the importance of empathy in social interactions and relationships\n    - B: By recognizing the role of mirror neurons in learning and empathy\n    - C: By demonstrating the need for more research on contagious yawning\n    - D: By showing that contagious yawning is only relevant in social psychology studies\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What does the relationship between mirror neurons and contagious yawning suggest about our brains?\n    - A: That our brains are wired to respond only to physiological stimuli\n    - B: That our brains are wired to respond only to psychological stimuli\n    - C: That our brains are wired to respond to others' emotions and behaviors\n    - D: That our brains are not wired to respond to others' emotions and behaviors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What does the contrast between physiological and psychological hypotheses of contagious yawning highlight?\n    - A: The simplicity of the phenomenon\n    - B: The complexity of the phenomenon and the need for further research\n    - C: The importance of empathy in social interactions and relationships\n    - D: The role of mirror neurons in learning and empathy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What could be the result of combining the fixed action pattern and non-conscious mimicry hypotheses of contagious yawning?\n    - A: A more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon, highlighting both reflex-like and unconscious imitation aspects\n    - B: A more limited understanding of the phenomenon, highlighting only the reflex-like aspect\n    - C: A more limited understanding of the phenomenon, highlighting only the unconscious imitation aspect\n    - D: No new insights into the phenomenon\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What could be the result of integrating the empathy yawn hypothesis with research on emotional intelligence and social skills?\n    - A: New insights into the importance of empathy in relationships and social interactions\n    - B: A more limited understanding of the phenomenon, highlighting only the physiological aspect\n    - C: A more limited understanding of the phenomenon, highlighting only the psychological aspect\n    - D: No new insights into the phenomenon\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) Why is it essential to evaluate the strengths and limitations of each hypothesis of contagious yawning?\n    - A: To determine the most promising avenues for further study\n    - B: To demonstrate the need for more research on the phenomenon\n    - C: To highlight the importance of empathy in social interactions and relationships\n    - D: To show that contagious yawning is only relevant in social psychology studies\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is the purpose of critiquing the methodology of existing studies on contagious yawning?\n    - A: To inform the design of future experiments and improve the validity of findings\n    - B: To demonstrate the need for more research on the phenomenon\n    - C: To highlight the importance of empathy in social interactions and relationships\n    - D: To show that contagious yawning is only relevant in social psychology studies\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) How do neuroimaging studies using fMRI contribute to our understanding of contagious yawning?\n    - A: By showing that contagious yawning is only a physiological response\n    - B: By demonstrating the role of mirror neurons in learning and empathy\n    - C: By highlighting the importance of empathy in social interactions and relationships\n    - D: By providing insight into the brain regions involved in contagious yawning\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n13) What is the role of empathy in the empathy yawn hypothesis of contagious yawning?\n    - A: To facilitate social bonding and relationships\n    - B: To enable people to learn and understand others' emotions\n    - C: To trigger a reflex-like response to yawning\n    - D: To suppress yawning in social situations\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n14) How do the findings on contagious yawning in dogs and primates contribute to our understanding of the phenomenon?\n    - A: By showing that contagious yawning is a universal phenomenon across species\n    - B: By highlighting the importance of empathy in social interactions and relationships\n    - C: By demonstrating the role of mirror neurons in learning and empathy\n    - D: By providing insight into the brain regions involved in contagious yawning\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
