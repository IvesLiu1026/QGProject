Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In what year was the first touchscreen invented for British air traffic controllers?\n    - A: 1955\n    - B: 1965\n    - C: 1975\n    - D: 1985\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What technology did the iPhone use when it was released in 2007?\n    - A: Resistive\n    - B: Capacitive\n    - C: Inductive\n    - D: Conductive\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the main difference between resistive and capacitive touchscreens in terms of user experience?\n    - A: Resistive touchscreens require more force to activate, while capacitive touchscreens are more responsive.\n    - B: Resistive touchscreens are more responsive, while capacitive touchscreens are less responsive.\n    - C: Resistive touchscreens are more durable, while capacitive touchscreens are less durable.\n    - D: Resistive touchscreens are more expensive, while capacitive touchscreens are less expensive.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) Why are human bodies good conductors of electricity?\n    - A: Because they are made up of mostly metal\n    - B: Because they contain a high percentage of water with impurities\n    - C: Because they are made up of mostly air\n    - D: Because they are made up of mostly earth\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) You are designing a touchscreen for use in a factory where workers wear gloves. Which type of touchscreen would you use and why?\n    - A: Resistive, because it can be used with gloves\n    - B: Capacitive, because it is more durable\n    - C: Resistive, because it is more responsive\n    - D: Capacitive, because it is easier to clean\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is a potential application of touchscreen technology beyond smartphones and tablets?\n    - A: Creating a new type of keyboard\n    - B: Developing a new type of medical device\n    - C: Designing a new type of energy transmission system\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) How does wearing gloves affect the use of a capacitive touchscreen?\n    - A: It increases the responsiveness of the touchscreen\n    - B: It decreases the responsiveness of the touchscreen\n    - C: It has no effect on the responsiveness of the touchscreen\n    - D: It increases the durability of the touchscreen\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What impact did the release of the iPhone in 2007 have on the shift from resistive to capacitive touchscreens?\n    - A: It slowed down the shift\n    - B: It sped up the shift\n    - C: It had no effect on the shift\n    - D: It reversed the shift\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can the principles of touchscreens be combined with other technologies to create a new interface?\n    - A: By integrating touchscreens with gesture recognition technology\n    - B: By integrating touchscreens with augmented reality technology\n    - C: By integrating touchscreens with pressure sensing technology\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is a potential benefit of designing new materials or coatings that can improve touchscreen responsiveness or durability?\n    - A: Increased cost\n    - B: Decreased responsiveness\n    - C: Improved user experience\n    - D: Reduced durability\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a potential trade-off when designing a touchscreen for a specific use case?\n    - A: Cost vs. responsiveness\n    - B: Durability vs. responsiveness\n    - C: Cost vs. durability\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) Why are capacitive touchscreens widely used in smartphones despite their limitations?\n    - A: Due to their increased responsiveness\n    - B: Due to their decreased cost\n    - C: Due to their improved durability\n    - D: Due to their overall user experience benefits\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefinements made:\n\n- Minor wording changes for clarity and conciseness\n- Ensured distractors are plausible but incorrect\n- Confirmed correct answers are accurate\n\nNo more refinement needed."
