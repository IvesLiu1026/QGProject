    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of bacteria is prevalent in the vagina and produces acid, lowering the pH?\n    - A: Escherichia coli\n    - B: Lactobacilli\n    - C: Staphylococcus aureus\n    - D: Streptococcus pneumoniae\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the most common species of Candida that causes vaginal thrush or yeast infections?\n    - A: Candida glabrata\n    - B: Candida albicans\n    - C: Candida tropicalis\n    - D: Candida krusei\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What plays a key role in controlling Candida cells and preventing infections in the vagina?\n    - A: Hormonal changes\n    - B: Diet\n    - C: The immune system\n    - D: Vaginal discharge\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What can alter the vaginal microbiome, making it more susceptible to yeast infections?\n    - A: Only hormonal changes\n    - B: Only diet\n    - C: Only genetic factors\n    - D: A combination of hormonal changes, diet, and other factors\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What is a recommended practice to help prevent yeast infections?\n    - A: Wearing tight, non-breathable clothing\n    - B: Using soaps that can damage the protective mucus in the vagina\n    - C: Gently washing the vulva with water and wiping from front to back\n    - D: Douching regularly\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What may be a potential treatment for yeast infections?\n    - A: Using probiotics containing harmless bacteria\n    - B: Using probiotics containing harmless yeasts\n    - C: Using antifungal medications regularly\n    - D: Practicing poor hygiene\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What happens to Candida albicans when the balance within the vagina is disrupted?\n    - A: It disappears completely\n    - B: It remains unchanged\n    - C: It assumes its disease-causing form\n    - D: It becomes a beneficial microorganism\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the effect of antibiotic treatments on the vaginal microbiome?\n    - A: Antibiotic treatments have no effect on the vaginal microbiome\n    - B: Antibiotic treatments can help maintain the balance of microorganisms\n    - C: Antibiotic treatments can disrupt the balance of microorganisms\n    - D: Antibiotic treatments can only affect the immune system\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the result of combining the ideas of the vaginal microbiome and the immune system in understanding yeast infections?\n    - A: Yeast infections are only caused by genetic factors\n    - B: Yeast infections are only caused by hormonal changes\n    - C: Yeast infections occur when the balance of microorganisms is disrupted and the immune system is weakened\n    - D: Yeast infections can only be treated with antifungal medications\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the potential benefit of considering the impact of hormonal changes, diet, and other factors on the vaginal microbiome?\n    - A: It can help identify the single cause of yeast infections\n    - B: It can help understand how to prevent yeast infections\n    - C: It can help develop a treatment for yeast infections\n    - D: It can help justify the lack of research on the vaginal microbiome\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a potential critique of the current research on the vaginal microbiome?\n    - A: There is too much funding for research on the vaginal microbiome\n    - B: There is a lack of research on the vaginal microbiome due to stigma and underfunding\n    - C: The current research on the vaginal microbiome is sufficient\n    - D: The vaginal microbiome is not an important area of research\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a potential justification for more research on the vaginal microbiome?\n    - A: To develop more antifungal medications\n    - B: To understand the causes of recurrent yeast infections and improve women's health\n    - C: To prove that yeast infections are only caused by genetic factors\n    - D: To show that the vaginal microbiome is not important for overall health\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
