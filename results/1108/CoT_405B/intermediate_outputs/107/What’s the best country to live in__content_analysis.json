    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was invented by Simon Kuznets in the 1930s.\n2. GDP measures the total monetary value of everything a country produces and sells on the market.\n3. GDP per capita is calculated by dividing the total GDP by the number of people living in a country.\n4. The United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI) takes into account health, education, and income per capita to estimate overall well-being.\n5. The Sustainable Development Index factors in both well-being and environmental burdens of economic growth.\n6. Costa Rica has managed to grow its economy and improve living standards substantially without drastically increasing its emissions.\n7. King Jigme Singye Wangchuk of Bhutan came up with the idea of Gross National Happiness in 1972.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. GDP was originally intended to gauge the size of an economy, but it has been used to measure well-being, which it does not accurately reflect.\n2. GDP does not account for the value of services like public schools or firefighters, as they are not sold on the market.\n3. A high GDP per capita does not necessarily mean that the typical person in a country has a high income, as wealth can be concentrated among a few individuals.\n4. The concept of Gross National Happiness aims to measure well-being by considering factors like health, education, and strong communities.\n5. The dashboard approach to measuring well-being involves considering multiple factors rather than relying on a single number.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. A country's GDP growth may not necessarily translate to improved living standards for its citizens, as seen in the case of countries where wages stopped keeping pace with GDP growth in the 1980s.\n2. The use of alternative metrics like Gross National Happiness or the Sustainable Development Index can provide a more comprehensive understanding of a country's well-being.\n3. Costa Rica's approach to sustainable development can serve as a model for other countries seeking to balance economic growth with environmental concerns.\n4. The dashboard approach to measuring well-being can be applied in various contexts, such as evaluating the effectiveness of government policies or comparing the quality of life in different cities.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. The relationship between GDP growth and improved living standards is not always direct, as seen in the case of countries where wages stopped keeping pace with GDP growth.\n2. The use of GDP as a measure of well-being has limitations, as it does not account for factors like income inequality or environmental degradation.\n3. The contrast between GDP and alternative metrics like Gross National Happiness highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to measuring well-being.\n4. The cause-and-effect relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation is complex, and metrics like the Sustainable Development Index can help to illuminate this relationship.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. Combining GDP with other metrics, like the Human Development Index or the Sustainable Development Index, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of a country's well-being.\n2. Integrating the concept of Gross National Happiness with other approaches to measuring well-being can help to create a more nuanced understanding of what contributes to a high quality of life.\n3. Considering multiple factors, such as economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social well-being, can help to create a more holistic approach to evaluating a country's performance.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of GDP as a measure of well-being requires considering its limitations and potential biases.\n2. Critiquing the use of GDP as a sole indicator of a country's performance involves analyzing its impact on policy decisions and societal outcomes.\n3. Justifying the use of alternative metrics, like Gross National Happiness or the Sustainable Development Index, requires evaluating their validity and reliability in measuring well-being.\n4. Assessing the trade-offs between economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social well-being requires evaluating the relative importance of each factor in contributing to a high quality of life."
