    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is the approximate altitude of Mt. Everest?\n    - A: 7,848 meters\n    - B: 8,848 meters\n    - C: 9,848 meters\n    - D: 10,848 meters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of barometric pressure at sea level is found at the top of Mt. Everest?\n    - A: 25%\n    - B: 33%\n    - C: 50%\n    - D: 75%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What happens to the air as altitude increases?\n    - A: It gets thicker, resulting in more oxygen for the body to absorb.\n    - B: It remains the same, with no change in oxygen levels.\n    - C: It gets thinner, resulting in less oxygen for the body to absorb.\n    - D: It becomes more humid, affecting the body's ability to adapt.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How long can acclimatization to high altitudes take?\n    - A: Several days\n    - B: Several weeks\n    - C: Several months\n    - D: Several years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-World Scenarios)**\n\n1) What should a person traveling to a high-altitude location for the first time do to avoid altitude sickness?\n    - A: Ascend rapidly to acclimate quickly\n    - B: Ascend gradually to allow for acclimatization\n    - C: Stay at a low altitude and avoid ascending\n    - D: Take medication to prevent altitude sickness\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What benefit can athletes training at high altitudes experience?\n    - A: Decreased red blood cell production\n    - B: Increased red blood cell production and improved oxygen delivery\n    - C: Improved cardiovascular health, but decreased oxygen delivery\n    - D: No benefits, only risks associated with high-altitude training\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and Contrasts)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between altitude and oxygen levels in the air?\n    - A: As altitude increases, oxygen levels increase.\n    - B: As altitude increases, oxygen levels remain the same.\n    - C: As altitude increases, oxygen levels decrease.\n    - D: There is no relationship between altitude and oxygen levels.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the contrast between the body's short-term and long-term adaptations to high altitudes?\n    - A: Short-term adaptations are more effective, while long-term adaptations are less effective.\n    - B: Short-term adaptations are less effective, while long-term adaptations are more effective.\n    - C: Short-term and long-term adaptations are equally effective.\n    - D: There is no contrast between short-term and long-term adaptations.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1) What combination of physiological adaptations allows the body to adapt to high altitudes?\n    - A: Increased red blood cell production and decreased heart rate\n    - B: Increased red blood cell production, ventilatory acclimatization, and cardiovascular adaptations\n    - C: Decreased red blood cell production and increased heart rate\n    - D: No adaptations are necessary for high-altitude acclimatization\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What factors influence an individual's ability to adapt to high altitudes?\n    - A: Genetic factors only\n    - B: Environmental factors only\n    - C: The interplay between genetic and environmental factors\n    - D: Neither genetic nor environmental factors play a role\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and Critique)**\n\n1) What should be considered when assessing the risks and benefits of climbing Mt. Everest?\n    - A: Only the potential benefits, such as the sense of accomplishment\n    - B: Only the potential risks, such as the risk of life-threatening conditions\n    - C: Both the potential benefits and risks, including the risk of life-threatening conditions\n    - D: Neither the potential benefits nor risks should be considered\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What should be evaluated when critiquing the scientific understanding of high-altitude physiology?\n    - A: Only the theoretical foundations of high-altitude physiology\n    - B: Only the practical applications of high-altitude physiology\n    - C: Both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of high-altitude physiology\n    - D: Neither the theoretical foundations nor practical applications should be evaluated\n[Correct answer]: C"
