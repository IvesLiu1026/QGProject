B: Fluent (Receptive) and Non-Fluent (Expressive)\n    - C: Primary Progressive and Stroke-Induced\n    - D: Broca's and Wernicke's\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is a primary characteristic of fluent aphasia?\n    - A: Difficulty with speech production and good comprehension\n    - B: Normal vocal inflection but difficulty comprehending speech\n    - C: Difficulty with both speech production and comprehension\n    - D: Good comprehension and normal speech production, but with word substitutions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined: Changed \"difficulty comprehending speech\" to \"difficulty understanding the speech of others\" to match the transcript.\n\n3) What is a primary characteristic of fluent aphasia?\n    - A: Difficulty with speech production and good comprehension\n    - B: Normal vocal inflection but difficulty understanding the speech of others\n    - C: Difficulty with both speech production and comprehension\n    - D: Good comprehension and normal speech production, but with word substitutions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What allows areas surrounding a brain lesion to take over some functions during recovery?\n    - A: Brain atrophy\n    - B: Brain plasticity\n    - C: Neurodegeneration\n    - D: Neurogenesis\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) How can individuals with aphasia be supported in their communication?\n    - A: Providing extra time and flexibility for communication\n    - B: Using visual aids and simple language\n    - C: Avoiding eye contact and nonverbal cues\n    - D: Interrupting and finishing their sentences\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined: Changed the question to make it more specific and concise.\n\n5) What is an effective way to support individuals with aphasia in their communication?\n    - A: Providing extra time and flexibility for communication\n    - B: Using complex language and avoiding eye contact\n    - C: Interrupting and finishing their sentences\n    - D: Ignoring their attempts to communicate\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is an effective treatment for aphasia caused by stroke or brain trauma?\n    - A: Speech therapy\n    - B: Occupational therapy\n    - C: Physical therapy\n    - D: Medication\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the primary difference between fluent and non-fluent aphasia?\n    - A: Fluent aphasia affects speech production, while non-fluent aphasia affects comprehension\n    - B: Fluent aphasia affects comprehension, while non-fluent aphasia affects speech production\n    - C: Fluent aphasia is characterized by normal vocal inflection, while non-fluent aphasia is characterized by hesitant speech\n    - D: Fluent aphasia is more common, while non-fluent aphasia is less common\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined: Changed the question to make it more specific and concise.\n\n7) What is the primary difference between fluent and non-fluent aphasia in terms of language processing?\n    - A: Fluent aphasia affects speech production, while non-fluent aphasia affects comprehension\n    - B: Fluent aphasia affects comprehension, while non-fluent aphasia affects speech production\n    - C: Fluent aphasia affects both speech production and comprehension, while non-fluent aphasia affects only speech production\n    - D: Fluent aphasia affects only comprehension, while non-fluent aphasia affects both speech production and comprehension\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the relationship between Broca's area and Wernicke's area in language processing?\n    - A: They are responsible for different aspects of language processing, such as speech production and comprehension\n    - B: They are responsible for the same aspect of language processing, such as speech production\n    - C: Broca's area is responsible for speech production, while Wernicke's area is responsible for language comprehension and semantic processing\n    - D: They are only involved in language processing in individuals with aphasia\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined: Changed the question to make it more specific and concise.\n\n8) What is the role of Broca's area and Wernicke's area in language processing?\n    - A: Broca's area is responsible for speech production, and Wernicke's area is responsible for language comprehension\n    - B: Broca's area is responsible for language comprehension, and Wernicke's area is responsible for speech production\n    - C: Both areas are responsible for speech production and language comprehension\n    - D: Neither area is involved in language processing\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) How can technology be used to support individuals with aphasia?\n    - A: By providing virtual reality experiences to practice communication\n    - B: By using apps and software to promote brain plasticity and language recovery\n    - C: By using text-to-speech devices to facilitate communication\n    - D: By limiting access to technology to reduce distractions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) Why is it essential to raise awareness about aphasia and promote understanding and support for individuals with the disorder?\n    - A: To reduce healthcare costs and resource allocation\n    - B: To improve language recovery and communication skills\n    - C: To enhance brain plasticity and cognitive function\n    - D: To promote social inclusion and reduce stigma\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is a crucial consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of different treatments for aphasia?\n    -
