    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**:\n\n1) What is the recommended frequency of urination for humans?\n    - A: At least 2-3 times a day\n    - B: At least 4-6 times a day\n    - C: At least 8-10 times a day\n    - D: As many times as possible\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the approximate capacity of the bladder before it becomes uncomfortable?\n    - A: 100-200 milliliters\n    - B: 400-500 milliliters\n    - C: 600-800 milliliters\n    - D: 1,000-1,200 milliliters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1) What is the primary function of the detrusor muscle in the bladder?\n    - A: To contract and relax to control breathing\n    - B: To contract and relax to control digestion\n    - C: To contract and relax to control urination\n    - D: To contract and relax to control blood pressure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the micturition reflex, and what is its primary function?\n    - A: A process that sends signals from the brain to the bladder to store urine\n    - B: A process that sends signals from the bladder to the brain to indicate the need to urinate\n    - C: A process that sends signals from the bladder to the kidneys to produce more urine\n    - D: A process that sends signals from the kidneys to the bladder to eliminate urine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**:\n\n1) A person is experiencing urinary incontinence and wants to manage their urination habits. What would be a helpful approach?\n    - A: Ignoring the problem and hoping it goes away\n    - B: Understanding how the urinary system works and making lifestyle changes\n    - C: Taking medication to alleviate symptoms\n    - D: Undergoing surgery to correct the issue\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A person needs to delay urination for a short period. What would be a helpful technique?\n    - A: Contracting the internal urethral sphincter\n    - B: Contracting the external urethral sphincter\n    - C: Relaxing the detrusor muscle\n    - D: Holding their breath\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1) What is the relationship between the detrusor muscle and the internal urethral sphincter in controlling urination?\n    - A: The detrusor muscle contracts, and the internal urethral sphincter relaxes\n    - B: The detrusor muscle relaxes, and the internal urethral sphincter contracts\n    - C: The detrusor muscle and internal urethral sphincter work together to contract and relax\n    - D: The detrusor muscle and internal urethral sphincter work independently to control urination\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the potential consequence of holding in urine for an extended period?\n    - A: Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles\n    - B: Weakening the pelvic floor muscles\n    - C: Increasing bladder capacity\n    - D: Decreasing bladder capacity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1) Combining knowledge of the urinary system with an understanding of pelvic floor muscles can lead to new insights into:\n    - A: The importance of maintaining strong pelvic floor muscles\n    - B: The importance of ignoring pelvic floor muscles\n    - C: The importance of weakening pelvic floor muscles\n    - D: The importance of surgically correcting pelvic floor muscles\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Integrating information about the micturition reflex with the role of the brain in controlling urination can provide a deeper understanding of:\n    - A: The complex interactions involved in digestion\n    - B: The complex interactions involved in respiration\n    - C: The complex interactions involved in urination\n    - D: The complex interactions involved in blood pressure regulation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1) Judging the habit of holding in urine as \"not great\" for long-term health requires evaluating the potential:\n    - A: Benefits of this behavior\n    - B: Consequences of this behavior\n    - C: Causes of this behavior\n    - D: Symptoms of this behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Critiquing the practice of forcing out urine too fast or urinating without proper physical support requires considering the potential impact on:\n    - A: The digestive system\n    - B: The respiratory system\n    - C: The pelvic floor muscles and urinary system\n    - D: The cardiovascular system\n[Correct answer]: C"
