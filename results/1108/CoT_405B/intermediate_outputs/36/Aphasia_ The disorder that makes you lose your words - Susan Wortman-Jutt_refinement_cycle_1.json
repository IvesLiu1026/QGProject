Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many people in the United States have aphasia?\n    - A: 500,000\n    - B: 1 million\n    - C: 1.5 million\n    - D: 2 million\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What are the two main categories of aphasia?\n    - A: Expressive and Receptive-Expressive\n    - B: Fluent (Receptive) and Non-Fluent (Expressive)\n    - C: Primary Progressive and Stroke-Induced\n    - D: Broca's and Wernicke's\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is a primary characteristic of fluent aphasia?\n    - A: Difficulty with speech production and good comprehension\n    - B: Normal vocal inflection but difficulty comprehending speech\n    - C: Difficulty with both speech production and comprehension\n    - D: Good comprehension and normal speech production\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What allows areas surrounding a brain lesion to take over some functions during recovery?\n    - A: Brain atrophy\n    - B: Brain plasticity\n    - C: Neurodegeneration\n    - D: Neurogenesis\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can individuals with aphasia be supported in their communication?\n    - A: Providing extra time and flexibility for communication\n    - B: Using complex vocabulary and sentence structures\n    - C: Avoiding eye contact and nonverbal cues\n    - D: Interrupting and finishing their sentences\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is an effective treatment for aphasia caused by stroke or brain trauma?\n    - A: Speech therapy\n    - B: Occupational therapy\n    - C: Physical therapy\n    - D: Medication\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the primary difference between fluent and non-fluent aphasia?\n    - A: Fluent aphasia affects speech production, while non-fluent aphasia affects comprehension\n    - B: Fluent aphasia affects comprehension, while non-fluent aphasia affects speech production\n    - C: Fluent aphasia is caused by stroke, while non-fluent aphasia is caused by dementia\n    - D: Fluent aphasia is more common, while non-fluent aphasia is less common\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the relationship between Broca's area and Wernicke's area in language processing?\n    - A: They are responsible for different aspects of language processing, such as speech production and comprehension\n    - B: They are responsible for the same aspect of language processing, such as speech production\n    - C: They are not involved in language processing\n    - D: They are only involved in language processing in individuals with aphasia\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) How can technology be used to support individuals with aphasia?\n    - A: By providing virtual reality experiences to practice communication\n    - B: By using apps and software to promote brain plasticity and language recovery\n    - C: By replacing human speech therapists with artificial intelligence\n    - D: By limiting access to technology to reduce distractions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) Why is it essential to raise awareness about aphasia and promote understanding and support for individuals with the disorder?\n    - A: To reduce healthcare costs and resource allocation\n    - B: To improve language recovery and communication skills\n    - C: To enhance brain plasticity and cognitive function\n    - D: To promote social inclusion and reduce stigma\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is a crucial consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of different treatments for aphasia?\n    - A: The cost of the treatment\n    - B: The length of time the treatment has been available\n    - C: The individual's quality of life and social interactions\n    - D: The treatment's impact on cognitive function\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is primary progressive aphasia (PPA), and how does it differ from other forms of aphasia?\n    - A: PPA is a type of aphasia caused by stroke or brain trauma\n    - B: PPA is a rare form of dementia that primarily affects language\n    - C: PPA is a type of aphasia that only affects speech production\n    - D: PPA is a type of aphasia that only affects comprehension\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 1-8 to improve clarity and conciseness. Questions 9-12 were revised to better align with the key concepts in the transcript and to provide more accurate and plausible distractors."
