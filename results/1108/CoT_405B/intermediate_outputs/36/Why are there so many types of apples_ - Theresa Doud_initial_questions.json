    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) How many apple varieties are there in the world?\n    - A: Over 1,000\n    - B: Over 5,000\n    - C: Over 7,500\n    - D: Over 10,000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the primary goal of fruit breeding?\n    - A: To create disease-resistant apples\n    - B: To fulfill the expectations of farmers and consumers\n    - C: To produce apples with a unique taste\n    - D: To create apples with a specific color\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) What is the main challenge that breeders face when creating new apple varieties?\n    - A: Balancing the needs of farmers and consumers\n    - B: Creating disease-resistant apples\n    - C: Producing apples with a unique taste\n    - D: Developing apples with a specific color\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the purpose of the evaluation stage in the process of creating a new apple variety?\n    - A: To assess the seedling's growth in different climates and soil types\n    - B: To determine the seedling's disease resistance\n    - C: To evaluate the seedling's taste and texture\n    - D: To assess the seedling's color and size\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Application**\n\n1) A breeder wants to create a new apple variety that is resistant to a specific disease. What method would they use?\n    - A: Grafting\n    - B: Cross-pollination\n    - C: Selection of parent apples\n    - D: Evaluation of seedlings\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A farmer wants to create exact copies of a popular apple variety. What method would they use?\n    - A: Cross-pollination\n    - B: Grafting\n    - C: Selection of parent apples\n    - D: Evaluation of seedlings\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the needs of farmers and consumers and the process of fruit breeding?\n    - A: The needs of farmers and consumers are not considered in the process of fruit breeding\n    - B: The needs of farmers and consumers are the primary consideration in the process of fruit breeding\n    - C: The needs of farmers and consumers are secondary to the needs of the breeder\n    - D: The needs of farmers and consumers are only considered in the evaluation stage\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the contrast between the time-consuming process of creating a new apple variety and the relatively quick process of grafting?\n    - A: The process of creating a new apple variety is quicker than grafting\n    - B: The process of creating a new apple variety is more time-consuming than grafting\n    - C: The process of creating a new apple variety and grafting take the same amount of time\n    - D: Grafting is not a part of the process of creating a new apple variety\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) A breeder wants to create a new apple variety that meets the needs of both farmers and consumers. What approach would they take?\n    - A: Selecting parent apples with desirable traits and cross-pollinating them\n    - B: Grafting a popular apple variety onto a disease-resistant rootstock\n    - C: Evaluating seedlings in different climates and soil types\n    - D: Creating a new apple variety with a unique taste or texture\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) A company wants to create a new apple variety that is specifically designed for a particular market or region. What approach would they take?\n    - A: Conducting market research to determine the desired traits of the new variety\n    - B: Selecting parent apples with desirable traits and cross-pollinating them\n    - C: Grafting a popular apple variety onto a disease-resistant rootstock\n    - D: Evaluating seedlings in different climates and soil types\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) A new apple variety has been developed that is resistant to a specific disease. How would you evaluate its effectiveness?\n    - A: By assessing its taste and texture\n    - B: By evaluating its disease resistance in different climates and soil types\n    - C: By determining its market demand\n    - D: By comparing it to existing apple varieties\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A breeder is considering using grafting as a method for creating exact copies of a new apple variety. What justification would they use?\n    - A: Grafting is a quicker and more cost-effective method than cross-pollination\n    - B: Grafting allows for the creation of exact copies of the new variety\n    - C: Grafting is a more reliable method than cross-pollination\n    - D: Grafting is not a suitable method for creating exact copies of a new apple variety\n[Correct answer]: B"
