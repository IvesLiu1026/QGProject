The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).\n3. Similar figures have the same shape, but not necessarily the same size.\n4. Scaling a figure by a factor multiplies its area by the square of that factor.\n5. The concept of \"blobs\" refers to any shape with a linear edge, not just squares.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The king wants to partition his land equally among his two daughters, and the counsellor suggests a way to do this using the Pythagorean theorem.\n2. The counsellor explains that the Pythagorean theorem applies to all similar figures, not just squares.\n3. The concept of similarity is used to prove that the Pythagorean theorem holds for all blobs.\n4. The counsellor uses a unit blob to explain how the area of a blob is related to its linear edge.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. The king can apply the Pythagorean theorem to partition his land equally among his daughters, regardless of the shape of the land masses.\n2. The counsellor's method can be used to solve problems involving similar figures and scaling.\n3. The concept of blobs can be applied to real-world problems involving irregular shapes.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The king and the counsellor analyze the relationship between the areas of similar figures and the Pythagorean theorem.\n2. The counsellor identifies the key properties of similar figures that make the Pythagorean theorem hold.\n3. The king and the counsellor examine the implications of the Pythagorean theorem for different shapes and sizes of blobs.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The counsellor combines the concepts of similarity and scaling to prove that the Pythagorean theorem holds for all blobs.\n2. The king and the counsellor synthesize their understanding of the Pythagorean theorem and its applications to solve the problem of partitioning the land.\n3. The counsellor creates a new concept, the \"blob Pythagorean theorem,\" by combining the ideas of similarity and scaling.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The king evaluates the counsellor's method for partitioning the land and determines that it is fair and effective.\n2. The counsellor justifies the use of the Pythagorean theorem for all similar figures, not just squares.\n3. The king and the counsellor assess the implications of the blob Pythagorean theorem for solving problems involving irregular shapes."
