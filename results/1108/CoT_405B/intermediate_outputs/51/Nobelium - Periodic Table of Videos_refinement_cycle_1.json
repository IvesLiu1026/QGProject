    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What was Alfred Nobel's primary field of work?\n    - A: Medicine\n    - B: Explosives and chemistry\n    - C: Physics\n    - D: Economics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is Nobelium named after?\n    - A: The Nobel Prize\n    - B: Alfred Nobel's discovery of stabilizing explosives\n    - C: The element's atomic number\n    - D: Alfred Nobel\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What was the significance of Alfred Nobel's discovery of stabilizing explosives?\n    - A: It led to a decline in the use of explosives in warfare\n    - B: It had no impact on the scientific community\n    - C: It led to significant developments in the 19th century, including the expansion of railways and warfare\n    - D: It was only used in the field of chemistry\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the primary purpose of the Nobel Prize?\n    - A: To recognize outstanding scientific discoveries that have a significant impact on their respective fields\n    - B: To promote scientific research and innovation\n    - C: To award scientists for their lifetime achievements\n    - D: To provide funding for scientific projects\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) What is a practical application of the stabilization of explosives?\n    - A: Safe handling and transportation\n    - B: Increased use in warfare\n    - C: Development of new medicines\n    - D: Expansion of railways\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What has been the impact of the Nobel Prize on scientific research and innovation?\n    - A: It has hindered scientific progress\n    - B: It has had no impact on scientific research\n    - C: It has been instrumental in promoting scientific research and innovation\n    - D: It has only recognized achievements in physics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between Alfred Nobel's discovery and the development of the Nobel Prize?\n    - A: The Nobel Prize was established before Nobel's discovery\n    - B: The Nobel Prize was established as a direct result of Nobel's wealth from his discovery\n    - C: The Nobel Prize was established to recognize outstanding achievements in physics\n    - D: There is no relationship between the two\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the contrast between the original controversy surrounding the naming of Nobelium and its eventual widespread acceptance?\n    - A: The controversy surrounding the naming of Nobelium led to its eventual rejection\n    - B: The controversy surrounding the naming of Nobelium had no impact on its acceptance\n    - C: The controversy surrounding the naming of Nobelium was eventually resolved, leading to its widespread acceptance\n    - D: The naming of Nobelium was never controversial\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is an example of the intersection of scientific discovery and innovation, as exemplified by Alfred Nobel's work and the Nobel Prize?\n    - A: The development of new medicines\n    - B: The expansion of railways\n    - C: The discovery of C60 and its potential applications in materials science and nanotechnology\n    - D: The use of explosives in warfare\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a justification for naming Nobelium after Alfred Nobel, despite his lack of direct involvement in its discovery?\n    - A: Nobelium was discovered by Nobel himself\n    - B: Nobel's discovery of stabilizing explosives led to significant developments in the 19th century\n    - C: The naming of Nobelium was a way to honor Nobel's contributions to science\n    - D: There is no justification for naming Nobelium after Nobel\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a critique of the Nobel Prize selection process?\n    - A: It is objective and unbiased\n    - B: It is subjective and biased\n    - C: It only recognizes achievements in physics\n    - D: It is only awarded to scientists from specific countries\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Why might winning the Nobel Prize be considered a rare achievement for chemists?\n    - A: Only a few chemists are eligible each year\n    - B: The selection process is biased against chemists\n    - C: Only three people can win it each year, making it a rare honor\n    - D: The Nobel Prize is not prestigious in the field of chemistry\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed question 10 from the original set, as it was not directly related to the transcript. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and concision. Additionally, I changed the correct answer for question 7 to reflect the accurate relationship between Alfred Nobel's discovery and the development of the Nobel Prize."
