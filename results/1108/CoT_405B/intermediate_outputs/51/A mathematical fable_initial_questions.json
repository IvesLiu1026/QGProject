What mathematical concept can be applied to solve this problem?\n    - A: Pythagorean theorem\n    - B: Similarity\n    - C: Scaling\n    - D: Geometry\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) A designer wants to create a scaled-up version of a irregular shape. What concept can be applied to ensure that the scaled-up version has the same proportions as the original shape?\n    - A: Similarity\n    - B: Scaling\n    - C: Pythagorean theorem\n    - D: Blob Pythagorean theorem\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the areas of similar figures and the Pythagorean theorem?\n    - A: The areas of similar figures are directly proportional to the square of their linear edges\n    - B: The areas of similar figures are inversely proportional to the square of their linear edges\n    - C: The areas of similar figures are equal to the sum of the squares of their linear edges\n    - D: The areas of similar figures are not related to the Pythagorean theorem\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What key properties of similar figures make the Pythagorean theorem hold?\n    - A: Equal size and shape\n    - B: Equal shape, but not necessarily equal size\n    - C: Equal size, but not necessarily equal shape\n    - D: Different shape and size\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) What concept is created by combining the ideas of similarity and scaling?\n    - A: Blob Pythagorean theorem\n    - B: Pythagorean theorem\n    - C: Similarity theorem\n    - D: Scaling theorem\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) How can the concepts of similarity and scaling be combined to solve a problem involving irregular shapes?\n    - A: By applying the Pythagorean theorem to the shape\n    - B: By scaling up the shape and applying the Pythagorean theorem\n    - C: By combining the concepts of similarity and scaling to create a new concept\n    - D: By ignoring the shape and focusing on the size\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) Why is the counsellor's method for partitioning the land fair and effective?\n    - A: Because it is based on the Pythagorean theorem\n    - B: Because it takes into account the shape and size of the land\n    - C: Because it is simple and easy to understand\n    - D: Because it is the only method available\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the justification for using the Pythagorean theorem for all similar figures, not just squares?\n    - A: Because it is a well-known theorem\n    - B: Because it is easy to apply\n    - C: Because it is based on the concept of similarity\n    - D: Because it is the only theorem available\n[Correct answer]: C"
