The world line of light always appears at the same angle in a space-time diagram.\n4. Albert Einstein developed the concept of the Lorentz transformation.\n5. The Lorentz transformation involves stretching and squashing space-time to get the correct speed of light from different perspectives.\n6. Lorentz contraction is the effect of objects appearing shorter due to the squashing of space-time.\n7. Time dilation is the effect of time getting muddled with space.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n1.
