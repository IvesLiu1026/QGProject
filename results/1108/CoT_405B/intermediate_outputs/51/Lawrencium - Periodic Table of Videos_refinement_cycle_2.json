    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Why are there no notable uses for the element Lawrencium?\n    - A: It is too unstable to be used safely.\n    - B: It is too expensive to produce in large quantities.\n    - C: Nobody has made enough Lawrencium to use it for anything.\n    - D: It is not an element that can be found naturally.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What was Ernest Lawrence famous for inventing?\n    - A: The Large Hadron Collider\n    - B: The Cyclotron\n    - C: The Electron Microscope\n    - D: The Spectrometer\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What was the initial size of the Cyclotron instrument conceived by Ernest Lawrence?\n    - A: A few feet across\n    - B: A few inches across\n    - C: A few yards across\n    - D: A few meters across\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How did the size of the magnet in the Cyclotron change as Lawrence built bigger machines?\n    - A: The magnet size remained the same.\n    - B: The magnet size decreased.\n    - C: The magnet size increased proportionally with the disc size.\n    - D: The magnet was removed.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What was the purpose of switching the voltage between the two copper discs in the Cyclotron?\n    - A: To slow down the electrons\n    - B: To accelerate the electrons continuously.\n    - C: To change the direction of the electrons\n    - D: To stop the electrons\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What was the ultimate goal of Ernest Lawrence's research group during the Second World War?\n    - A: To develop a new source of renewable energy\n    - B: To enrich uranium isotopes, specifically Uranium-235, for the atom bomb.\n    - C: To create a new medical treatment\n    - D: To develop a new material for construction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made minor adjustments to improve clarity and conciseness, and to ensure that distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also confirmed that the correct answers are accurate."
