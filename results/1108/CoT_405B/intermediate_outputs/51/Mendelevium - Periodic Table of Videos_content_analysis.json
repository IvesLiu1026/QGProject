    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge**:\n1. Mendelevium is named after Dimitri Mendeleev.\n2. The periodic table is called the Mendeleev table in Russia.\n3. Mendeleev is a well-known chemist.\n4. Mendeleev worked on the periodic table.\n5. Mendeleev discovered the standard for the strength of vodka (40% ethanol in water).\n6. The formula for vodka is ethanol plus water.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n1. Mendeleev's work on the periodic table involved rationalizing the properties of elements and understanding their behavior.\n2. The periodic table was developed to organize elements based on their properties.\n3. Mendeleev's discovery of the standard for vodka has been widely used in experiments.\n\n**Application**:\n1. Using 40% ethanol in water as a solvent in chemical reactions.\n2. Understanding the properties of elements and their relationships in the periodic table can be applied in various scientific fields.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. The relationship between Mendeleev's work on the periodic table and his discovery of the standard for vodka.\n2. The contrast between the practical application of Mendeleev's work on vodka and the lack of practical application of Mendelevium.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between Mendeleev's work on the periodic table and the development of modern chemistry.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n1. Combining the concepts of the periodic table and chemical properties to understand the behavior of elements.\n2. Integrating Mendeleev's work on vodka with his work on the periodic table to understand his contributions to chemistry.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n1. Assessing the significance of Mendeleev's work on the periodic table and its impact on modern chemistry.\n2. Evaluating the relevance of Mendelevium in the real world and its lack of practical applications.\n3. Justifying the use of 40% ethanol in water as a solvent in chemical reactions based on Mendeleev's discovery."
