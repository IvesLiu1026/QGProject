    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In what year was rhenium discovered?\n    - A: 1920\n    - B: 1925\n    - C: 1930\n    - D: 1935\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which river is rhenium named after?\n    - A: River Elbe\n    - B: River Rhine\n    - C: River Danube\n    - D: River Seine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why does rhenium appear white when in a salt form, such as perrenate?\n    - A: Due to its high density\n    - B: Because it absorbs visible light\n    - C: As a result of its low atomic number\n    - D: Since it absorbs ultraviolet light instead of visible light\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) Why is rhenium used in making aircraft engine turbine blades?\n    - A: Due to its low melting point\n    - B: Because of its ability to withstand high temperatures and stresses\n    - C: As a result of its low density\n    - D: Since it is a common metal\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What property of rhenium makes it suitable for use in catalysis?\n    - A: Its high melting point\n    - B: Its ability to absorb ultraviolet light\n    - C: Its properties as a rare and dense metal\n    - D: Its low density\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What potential applications of rhenium are being considered due to its properties?\n    - A: Use in medical implants\n    - B: Use in solar cells and as a catalyst for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen\n    - C: Use in construction materials\n    - D: Use in electronics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between rhenium's position in the periodic table and its density?\n    - A: Its position in the periodic table results in a low density\n    - B: Its position in the periodic table has no effect on its density\n    - C: Its position in the periodic table contributes to its high density\n    - D: Its density is not related to the periodic table\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a notable difference between rhenium salts and manganese salts?\n    - A: Rhenium salts are purple, while manganese salts are white\n    - B: Rhenium salts are white, while manganese salts are purple\n    - C: Rhenium salts are colorless, while manganese salts are colored\n    - D: Rhenium salts and manganese salts have the same color\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What could be a potential consequence of not recycling rhenium from turbine blades?\n    - A: An increase in the availability of rhenium\n    - B: A decrease in the demand for rhenium\n    - C: A reduction in the cost of rhenium\n    - D: A decrease in the availability of rhenium\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is the significance of using single-crystal rhenium in turbine blades?\n    - A: It reduces the strength of the turbine blade\n    - B: It has no effect on the turbine blade's performance\n    - C: It increases the turbine blade's resistance to heat\n    - D: It eliminates weaknesses between crystals, making the turbine blade stronger\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) How does the use of rhenium in turbine blades impact the aerospace industry?\n    - A: It has a minimal impact on the aerospace industry\n    - B: It has a significant impact on the aerospace industry, but not on other industries\n    - C: It has a significant impact on various industries, including aerospace and catalysis\n    - D: It has no impact on any industry\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a notable property of the turbine blade sample shown?\n    - A: It is made of a low-density metal\n    - B: It is a single crystal with a hollow structure\n    - C: It is made of a common metal alloy\n    - D: It is not designed for high-temperature applications\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made some changes to the questions to improve their clarity and conciseness, as well as to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also added a few new questions to cover additional key concepts from the transcript."
