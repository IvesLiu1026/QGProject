What type of study would be most reliable to evaluate this claim?\n    - A: Epidemiological study\n    - B: Randomized clinical trial (RCT)\n    - C: Case-control study\n    - D: Cohort study\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A study on the health effects of a particular herb was conducted using an epidemiological study. What is a limitation of this study?\n    - A: It cannot establish a correlation between the herb and health outcomes\n    - B: It cannot establish a causal relationship between the herb and health outcomes\n    - C: It is not suitable for studying rare health outcomes\n    - D: It is not suitable for studying long-term health outcomes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, Contrasts, Cause-and-Effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the randomization of subjects in RCTs and the ability to establish causal relationships?\n    - A: Randomization increases the risk of confounding variables\n    - B: Randomization decreases the risk of confounding variables\n    - C: Randomization has no effect on the risk of confounding variables\n    - D: Randomization is not necessary to establish causal relationships\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How do RCTs and epidemiological studies differ in terms of their ability to establish causal relationships?\n    - A: RCTs can establish causal relationships, while epidemiological studies cannot\n    - B: Epidemiological studies can establish causal relationships, while RCTs cannot\n    - C: Both RCTs and epidemiological studies can establish causal relationships\n    - D: Neither RCTs nor epidemiological studies can establish causal relationships\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1) How can the principles of RCTs and epidemiological studies be combined to design a study that can establish a causal relationship between a substance and a health outcome?\n    - A: By using a randomized epidemiological study\n    - B: By using a controlled epidemiological study\n    - C: By using a prospective cohort study with randomization\n    - D: By using a retrospective case-control study with randomization\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How can the concepts of confounding variables and randomization be integrated to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the limitations of epidemiological studies?\n    - A: By recognizing that confounding variables can be eliminated through randomization\n    - B: By recognizing that randomization can reduce the risk of confounding variables\n    - C: By recognizing that confounding variables can affect the results of epidemiological studies\n    - D: By recognizing that randomization is not necessary in epidemiological studies\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, Critique, Justification)**\n\n1) What is a criterion for evaluating the reliability of a study based on its methodology and potential biases?\n    - A: The study's sample size\n    - B: The study's duration\n    - C: The study's use of randomization and blinding\n    - D: The study's funding source\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is it necessary to justify the need for multiple, well-conducted studies to demonstrate a correlation between a substance and a health outcome?\n    - A: Because a single study can establish a causal relationship\n    - B: Because multiple studies can eliminate confounding variables\n    - C: Because multiple studies can increase the confidence in the findings\n    - D: Because multiple studies can reduce the cost of research\n[Correct answer]: C"
