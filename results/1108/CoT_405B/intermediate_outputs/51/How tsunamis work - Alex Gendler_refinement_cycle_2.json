    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) In what year did the Persian soldiers invade Potidaea, only to be thwarted by a tsunami-like event?\n    - A: 478 BC\n    - B: 479 BC\n    - C: 480 BC\n    - D: 477 BC\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the literal translation of the Japanese word \"tsunami\"?\n    - A: Ocean wave\n    - B: Harbor wave\n    - C: Tidal wave\n    - D: Earthquake wave\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary difference between the energy sources of normal ocean waves and tsunamis?\n    - A: Wind vs. ocean currents\n    - B: Wind vs. underwater seismic activity\n    - C: Ocean currents vs. tidal forces\n    - D: Tidal forces vs. underwater volcanic eruptions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to a tsunami wave when it reaches shallow water?\n    - A: Its speed increases and height decreases\n    - B: Its speed decreases and height increases\n    - C: Its speed remains the same and height decreases\n    - D: Its speed remains the same and height increases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is an effective way to help prevent loss of life and property due to tsunamis?\n    - A: Building higher sea walls\n    - B: Establishing global communication networks for early warnings\n    - C: Creating artificial reefs to block tsunamis\n    - D: Implementing a tsunami tax to fund research\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential limitation of building sea walls and flood gates to mitigate tsunami impact?\n    - A: They are too expensive to build\n    - B: They are not aesthetically pleasing\n    - C: They may not always be effective in stopping tsunamis\n    - D: They require too much maintenance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the primary cause-and-effect connection between tsunamis and the destruction they cause?\n    - A: Tsunamis cause destruction due to their high wind speeds\n    - B: Tsunamis cause destruction due to their massive energy release\n    - C: Tsunamis cause destruction due to their slow speed\n    - D: Tsunamis cause destruction due to their low wave height\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the movement of tectonic plates on the Earth's surface relate to tsunamis?\n    - A: It has no relation to tsunamis\n    - B: It causes tsunamis by creating ocean currents\n    - C: It causes tsunamis by triggering underwater seismic activity\n    - D: It causes tsunamis by changing the Earth's gravitational forces\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a potential benefit of combining knowledge of tsunamis with understanding of early detection and monitoring systems?\n    - A: Developing more accurate weather forecasts\n    - B: Developing effective warning systems for tsunamis\n    - C: Developing new methods for predicting earthquakes\n    - D: Developing more efficient emergency response plans\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) How can integrating information about tsunamis with knowledge of coastal geography and urban planning contribute to safer coastal communities?\n    - A: By building more sea walls and flood gates\n    - B: By developing more effective evacuation routes and emergency response plans\n    - C: By creating artificial reefs to block tsunamis\n    - D: By implementing a tsunami tax to fund research\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a crucial factor to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of different methods for preventing or mitigating the impact of tsunamis?\n    - A: Cost of implementation\n    - B: Aesthetic appeal\n    - C: Potential environmental impact\n    - D: Ability to adapt to different tsunami scenarios\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is a key justification for the need for global communication networks and early warning systems to prevent loss of life and property due to tsunamis?\n    - A: The high cost of tsunami damage\n    - B: The unpredictability of tsunami events\n    - C: The potential for tsunamis to affect multiple countries\n    - D: The need for more accurate weather forecasts\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo significant changes were necessary, as the questions were already well-written and aligned with the key concepts. However, I did review the distractors to ensure they were plausible but incorrect, and made some minor adjustments to the wording of a few questions to improve clarity."
