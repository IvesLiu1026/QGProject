Which of the following areas might be a promising avenue for investigation?\n    - A: Medical imaging\n    - B: Renewable energy\n    - C: Aerospace engineering\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What might be a potential benefit of combining the properties of tellurium with other elements to create new materials or applications?\n    - A: Increased efficiency in laser optics\n    - B: Improved safety protocols for handling tellurium\n    - C: Discovery of new properties or applications\n    - D: Reduced cost of production\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential risk of working with tellurium, and how might it be mitigated?\n    - A: Risk of explosion, mitigated by handling it in a well-ventilated area\n    - B: Risk of unpleasant odors, mitigated by wearing gloves and a face mask\n    - C: Risk of skin irritation, mitigated by storing it in a sealed container\n    - D: Risk of temporary blindness, mitigated by using protective eyewear\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) What is a potential risk associated with handling tellurium, and what precaution can be taken to minimize it?\n    - A: Risk of explosion, mitigated by handling it in a well-ventilated area\n    - B: Risk of unpleasant odors, mitigated by wearing protective gear and handling it carefully\n    - C: Risk of skin irritation, mitigated by storing it in a sealed container\n    - D: Risk of temporary blindness, mitigated by using protective eyewear\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n14) What might be a justification for using high-standard tellurium material in experiments and applications?\n    - A: High-standard material is less expensive than lower-quality alternatives\n    - B: High-standard material is more readily available than lower-quality alternatives\n    - C: High-standard material is necessary to ensure reliable and consistent results\n    - D: High-standard material is required by regulatory agencies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nQuestions 6 and 13 were slightly modified to improve clarity and concision. However, no major changes were necessary, as the questions already aligned well with the key concepts in the transcript. Therefore, no further refinement is necessary beyond the minor adjustments made.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
