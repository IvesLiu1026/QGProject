    "content_analysis": "**Bloom's Taxonomy Analysis**\n\n**1. Knowledge**:\n- Thulium is a lanthanide.\n- Thulium is very expensive.\n- The lanthanides undergo a contraction from left to right, resulting in similar sizes.\n- Thulium can obtain the +3 and +2 oxidation states.\n- Charles James isolated thulium in 1911 through 15,000 recrystallizations.\n- Thulium was first isolated as a chloride compound.\n\n**2. Comprehension**:\n- The lanthanides' contraction makes it difficult to separate them due to their similar sizes.\n- Thulium's high cost is a result of the difficulty in separating it from its neighbors.\n- Thulium's ability to obtain the +2 oxidation state makes it potentially useful for chemists.\n\n**3. Application**:\n- Using thulium in applications where its unique +2 oxidation state is beneficial.\n- Developing more efficient methods for separating lanthanides, including thulium.\n- Exploring potential uses for thulium in various fields, such as chemistry or materials science.\n\n**4. Analysis**:\n- The relationship between the lanthanides' contraction and the difficulty in separating them.\n- The contrast between thulium's high cost and its potential usefulness due to its +2 oxidation state.\n- The cause-and-effect connection between Charles James' recrystallization process and the isolation of thulium.\n\n**5. Synthesis**:\n- Combining thulium's unique properties with other elements to create new compounds or materials.\n- Integrating thulium into existing technologies to take advantage of its +2 oxidation state.\n- Developing new methods for separating lanthanides, including thulium, by leveraging their chemical properties.\n\n**6. Evaluation**:\n- Justifying the high cost of thulium given its potential uses and the difficulty in separating it.\n- Evaluating the significance of Charles James' achievement in isolating thulium through 15,000 recrystallizations.\n- Assessing the potential impact of thulium's increased use on various fields, such as chemistry or materials science."
