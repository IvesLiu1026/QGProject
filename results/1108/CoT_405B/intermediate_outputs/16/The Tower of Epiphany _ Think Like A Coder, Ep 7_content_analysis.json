Their goal is to reach the Node of Creation.\n3. There are barriers of energy separating them from the Node.\n4. Ethic must use three energy streams to climb the tower.\n5. A timer counts down from 60 seconds when Ethic steps forward.\n6. A basin made of invisible towers can hold energy between them.\n7. A torrent of energy will pour down from above after one minute.\n8. The energy will fill one unit at a time, with a force field preventing it from spilling out.\n9. Diagrams on the walls illustrate examples of configurations to capture energy.\n10. Hedge can make one tower of blocks visible at a time and count how tall it is.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n1. The energy will only overflow if there's no space that could hold it.\n2. Each unoccupied cell will hold energy if and only if there is a wall eventually to its left and a wall eventually to its right.\n3. Hedge can consider a whole column of blocks at a time to determine how many units of energy it can hold.\n4. The algorithm to determine the number of units of energy a column can hold involves finding the height of the tallest stack to the left and right, taking the smaller of the two, and subtracting the height of the original column.\n5. The energy lift will fail if Ethic and Hedge get the amount of energy wrong.\n\n**Application**:\n1. The algorithm to determine the number of units of energy a column can hold can be applied to an entire basin with a loop that starts on the left-most column and moves right, one column at a time.\n2. The algorithm can be optimized by keeping a running tally of the highest stack to the left and right, reducing the number of times Hedge needs to look at the stacks.\n3. The optimized algorithm can be used to calculate the total amount of energy that will be above every stack in the basin.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. The relationship between the height of the stacks and the amount of energy that can be held in the basin.\n2. The cause-and-effect connection between the energy pouring down from above and the force field preventing it from spilling out.\n3. The contrast between the original algorithm and the optimized algorithm in terms of efficiency.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n1. Combining the idea of considering a whole column of blocks at a time with the algorithm to determine the number of units of energy a column can hold to create a more efficient solution.\n2. Integrating the optimized algorithm with the loop that starts on the left-most column and moves right, one column at a time, to calculate the total amount of energy that will be above every stack in the basin.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n1. Judging the effectiveness of the original algorithm versus the optimized algorithm in terms of efficiency and accuracy.\n2. Evaluating the trade-offs between the time it takes to calculate the total amount of energy and the accuracy of the calculation.\n3. Justifying the use of the optimized algorithm in the given scenario, considering the time constraint and the consequences of getting the amount of energy wrong."
