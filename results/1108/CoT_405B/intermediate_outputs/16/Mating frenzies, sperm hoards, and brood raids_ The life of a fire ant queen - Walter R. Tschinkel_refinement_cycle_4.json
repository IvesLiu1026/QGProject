    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the scientific name of the fire ant species described in the transcript?\n    - A: Solenopsis invicta\n    - B: Formica rufa\n    - C: Camponotus Pennsylvanicus\n    - D: Apis mellifera\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) How long does a fire ant queen typically reign over her colony?\n    - A: 5 years\n    - B: 8 years\n    - C: 10 years\n    - D: 15 years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the primary goal of a fire ant colony?\n    - A: To establish a complex social structure\n    - B: To forage for food and defend the colony\n    - C: To reproduce and spread the queen's genes\n    - D: To maintain a stable population size\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n4) What is the role of the queen ant in establishing and maintaining the colony?\n    - A: To forage for food and defend the colony\n    - B: To lay eggs and nourish her brood\n    - C: To manage the colony's social structure and reproduction\n    - D: To produce fertile alates and establish new colonies\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n5) What is the queen ant's primary role in the early stages of colony establishment?\n    - A: To forage for food and defend the colony\n    - B: To lay eggs and nourish her brood\n    - C: To establish the colony's social structure\n    - D: To produce fertile alates\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What can understanding the life cycle of fire ants help with?\n    - A: Managing infestations and preventing the spread of invasive species\n    - B: Informing conservation efforts and habitat management\n    - C: Providing insights into effective management strategies for other social insects\n    - D: Understanding the biology and ecology of other social insects\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between the queen and her workers in a fire ant colony?\n    - A: The queen is dependent on her workers for survival and reproduction\n    - B: The workers are dependent on the queen for reproduction and colony growth\n    - C: The queen and her workers have a symbiotic relationship\n    - D: The queen's influence declines as the colony grows and matures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n8) What triggers the production of fertile alates in a fire ant colony?\n    - A: The colony's population size exceeds 10,000\n    - B: The colony's population size exceeds 23,000\n    - C: The colony's age exceeds 5 years\n    - D: The colony's food supply is abundant\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What characterizes the life cycle of fire ants?\n    - A: A simple process involving only the queen and her workers\n    - B: A complex process involving the interplay of multiple factors, including reproduction and colony growth\n    - C: A linear process involving the queen, workers, and fertile alates\n    - D: A cyclical process involving the queen, workers, and fertile alates\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n10) How does the queen's influence change as the colony grows and matures?\n    - A: The queen's influence increases as the colony grows and matures\n    - B: The queen's influence remains constant as the colony grows and matures\n    - C: The queen's influence declines as the colony grows and matures, but she remains essential for reproduction\n    - D: The queen's influence is unaffected by the colony's growth and maturity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n11) How effective are the colony's strategies for managing environmental challenges, such as flooding?\n    - A: Very effective, as the colony can adapt quickly to environmental changes\n    - B: Somewhat effective, as the colony can adapt to some environmental changes but not others\n    - C: Not very effective, as the colony is vulnerable to environmental changes\n    - D: Not at all effective, as the colony is unable to adapt to environmental changes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed."
