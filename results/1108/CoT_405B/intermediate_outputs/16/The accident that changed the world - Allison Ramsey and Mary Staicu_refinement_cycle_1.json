A: 1-5%\n    - B: 5-15%\n    - C: 20-30%\n    - D: 40-50%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What led to the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming?\n    - A: A deliberate experiment to find an antibacterial compound\n    - B: An observation of a mold growing on a petri dish and its effect on nearby bacteria\n    - C: A study of the properties of different types of bacteria\n    - D: A review of existing literature on antibacterial compounds\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to: What led to the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928?\n    - A: A deliberate experiment to find an antibacterial compound\n    - B: An observation of a mold growing on a petri dish he had forgotten to place in his incubator\n    - C: A study of the properties of different types of bacteria\n    - D: A review of existing literature on antibacterial compounds\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How does penicillin work as an antibacterial agent?\n    - A: By disrupting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls\n    - B: By interfering with bacterial DNA replication\n    - C: By inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis\n    - D: By activating the host's immune system\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to: What is the primary mechanism by which penicillin kills bacteria?\n    - A: Disrupting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls\n    - B: Interfering with bacterial DNA replication\n    - C: Inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis\n    - D: Activating the host's immune system\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) What is a potential consequence of the overuse of antibiotics?\n    - A: Increased effectiveness against bacterial infections\n    - B: Decreased risk of allergic reactions\n    - C: Development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics\n    - D: Reduced need for new antibiotic development\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) How has the discovery of penicillin impacted the treatment of infections?\n    - A: It has had no significant impact\n    - B: It has led to the development of more ineffective treatments\n    - C: It has transformed the treatment of infections and saved countless lives\n    - D: It has only been useful for treating a narrow range of infections\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between the Penicillium mold and the bacteria it kills an example of?\n    - A: Symbiosis\n    - B: Mutualism\n    - C: Microbial defense system\n    - D: Commensalism\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the development of bacterial resistance to penicillin an example of?\n    - A: Genetic drift\n    - B: Gene flow\n    - C: Evolution in action\n    - D: Natural selection\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to: What is the development of bacterial resistance to penicillin an example of in terms of evolutionary processes?\n    - A: Genetic drift\n    - B: Gene flow\n    - C: Evolution in action through natural selection\n    - D: Mutation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What factors contributed to the discovery of penicillin?\n    - A: Chance observation alone\n    - B: Scientific inquiry alone\n    - C: A combination of chance observation and scientific inquiry\n    - D: The work of a single researcher\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) How can the issue of bacterial resistance to penicillin be addressed?\n    - A: By developing new antibiotics and using existing ones more judiciously\n    - B: By relying solely on existing antibiotics\n    - C: By developing new antibacterial compounds that work by a different mechanism\n    - D: By reducing the use of antibiotics in medicine\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to: What is a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue of bacterial resistance to penicillin?\n    - A: Developing new antibiotics and using existing ones more judiciously\n    - B: Relying solely on existing antibiotics\n    - C: Developing new antibacterial compounds that work by a different mechanism\n    - D: Reducing the use of antibiotics in medicine without developing new ones\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How can the discovery of penicillin be evaluated?\n    - A: As a minor scientific breakthrough\n    - B: As a significant scientific breakthrough\n    - C: As a failure in the scientific community\n    - D: As a result of luck rather than scientific inquiry\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What can be said about the overuse of antibiotics?\n    - A: It is a minor public health concern\n    - B: It is a major public health concern\n    - C: It has no impact on public health\n    - D: It is only a concern in developing countries\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nAdditional suggestions:\n\n- Consider adding a question about the percentage of people who outgrow their penicillin allergy.\n- Consider adding a question about the importance of proper diagnosis of penicillin allergy to avoid unnecessary avoidance of the antibiotic.\n- Consider rephrasing some questions to make them more concise and direct."
