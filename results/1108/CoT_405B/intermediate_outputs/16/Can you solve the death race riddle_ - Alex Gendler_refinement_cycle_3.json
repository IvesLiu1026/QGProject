    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) Who kidnapped the protagonist's uncle, Slate Kanoli?\n    - A: The Yes-Side gang\n    - B: The No-Side gang\n    - C: The Coil Runner gang\n    - D: The Turbo Thruster gang\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What are the three critical failures that can occur in the Coil Runner?\n    - A: Ignition explosion, Fuel leak, and Oxygen level depletion\n    - B: Ignition explosion, Reactor leak, and Helium tank depletion\n    - C: Ignition explosion, Reactor leak, and Oxygen level depletion\n    - D: Fuel leak, Reactor leak, and Oxygen level depletion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) Why must the protagonist participate in the Death Race?\n    - A: To test the Coil Runner's emergency turbo thrusters\n    - B: To rescue their uncle\n    - C: To win a prize\n    - D: To gain fame\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is the main issue with the Coil Runner's emergency turbo thrusters?\n    - A: They are too slow\n    - B: They are too expensive\n    - C: They have some kinks to work out, which can lead to critical failures\n    - D: They are too heavy\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) If the protagonist wants to clear the jump without triggering any critical failures, what should they do?\n    - A: Activate thrusters A, B, and C\n    - B: Activate thrusters D and E\n    - C: Activate thrusters A, D, and E\n    - D: Activate all thrusters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) How can the protagonist identify the causes of the critical failures?\n    - A: By using the process of elimination\n    - B: By analyzing the relationships between the thrusters and the critical failures using Uncle Slate's notes\n    - C: By ignoring Uncle Slate's notes\n    - D: By guessing randomly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to match question 7.\n\n7) How can the protagonist identify the causes of the critical failures?\n    - A: By using the process of elimination\n    - B: By analyzing the relationships between the thrusters and the critical failures using Uncle Slate's notes\n    - C: By relying solely on intuition\n    - D: By guessing randomly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the relationship between the thrusters and the critical failures?\n    - A: The thrusters have no effect on the critical failures\n    - B: The thrusters directly cause the critical failures\n    - C: The thrusters indirectly cause the critical failures through a chain reaction\n    - D: The thrusters only affect the Fuel gauge\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What is the role of the Gravitometer spin in the test runs?\n    - A: It is the cause of the Ignition explosion\n    - B: It is the cause of the Reactor leak\n    - C: It is a common factor in two different test runs, but not the cause of any particular malfunction\n    - D: It is irrelevant to the critical failures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) How can the protagonist develop a plan to clear the jump without triggering any critical failures?\n    - A: By combining the knowledge from Uncle Slate's notes with their own problem-solving skills\n    - B: By analyzing the relationships between the thrusters and the critical failures using Uncle Slate's notes\n    - C: By ignoring Uncle Slate's notes and relying on luck\n    - D: By using a random generator to select the thrusters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to match question 11.\n\n11) How can the protagonist develop a plan to clear the jump without triggering any critical failures?\n    - A: By relying solely on Uncle Slate's notes\n    - B: By analyzing the relationships between the thrusters and the critical failures using Uncle Slate's notes\n    - C: By ignoring Uncle Slate's notes and relying on luck\n    - D: By using a random generator to select the thrusters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What is the result of integrating the information from the test runs?\n    - A: The protagonist identifies the relationships between the thrusters and the critical failures\n    - B: The protagonist becomes confused and unable to make a decision\n    - C: The protagonist ignores the test runs and relies on intuition\n    - D: The protagonist only considers the Fuel gauge\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n13) What should the protagonist consider when evaluating the risks and consequences of activating different thrusters?\n    - A: Only the potential benefits\n    - B: Only the potential risks\n    - C: Both the potential benefits and risks\n    - D: Neither the potential benefits nor risks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n14) How can the protagonist justify their decision to activate thrusters D and E?\n    - A: By relying on luck\n    - B: By ignoring Uncle Slate's notes\n    - C: By analyzing the test runs and using the logic of cause and effect\n    - D: By considering only the Fuel gauge\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nQuestions 6 and 10 were refined to match questions 7 and 11, respectively. The other questions did not require refinement."
