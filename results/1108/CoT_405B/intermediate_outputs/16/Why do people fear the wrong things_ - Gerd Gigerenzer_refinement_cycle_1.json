    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) According to a 2009 review, what was the absolute risk reduction of mammography screenings in terms of breast cancer deaths?\n    - A: 0.5%\n    - B: 0.1%\n    - C: 1%\n    - D: 5%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) By what factor have shark attacks increased, according to the given information?\n    - A: 1.5\n    - B: 2\n    - C: 3\n    - D: 4\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is a common challenge in understanding risk, as mentioned in the transcript?\n    - A: The difference between absolute and relative benefits\n    - B: The difference between relative and absolute risks\n    - C: The concept of statistical thinking\n    - D: Personal preference\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What can help individuals better evaluate risk and make informed decisions?\n    - A: Understanding how relative and absolute benefits work\n    - B: Understanding how relative and absolute risks work\n    - C: Ignoring personal preferences\n    - D: Avoiding statistical thinking\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) When considering a medication that lowers heart attack risk, what factors should an individual take into account?\n    - A: Only the relative risk reduction\n    - B: Only the absolute risk reduction\n    - C: Both the relative and absolute risks, as well as potential side effects and individual circumstances\n    - D: Neither relative nor absolute risks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is necessary to evaluate the risks and benefits of a medication or treatment?\n    - A: Considering only the relative risk\n    - B: Considering only the absolute risk\n    - C: Considering both the relative and absolute risks, as well as individual circumstances\n    - D: Ignoring potential side effects\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What can be misleading about the relationship between relative and absolute risks?\n    - A: A small relative risk reduction always corresponds to a small absolute risk reduction\n    - B: A large relative risk reduction always corresponds to a large absolute risk reduction\n    - C: A large relative risk reduction may correspond to a small absolute risk reduction\n    - D: A small relative risk reduction may correspond to a large absolute risk reduction\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a common challenge in risk evaluation, as mentioned in the transcript?\n    - A: Reducing one risk without affecting another risk\n    - B: Increasing one risk without reducing another risk\n    - C: The trade-off between reducing one risk and increasing another risk\n    - D: Ignoring potential side effects\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can help individuals make more informed decisions about their health and well-being?\n    - A: Ignoring relative risks\n    - B: Ignoring absolute risks\n    - C: Combining the concepts of relative and absolute risks, and considering individual circumstances\n    - D: Considering only one perspective\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can help individuals critically evaluate information and make better decisions?\n    - A: Ignoring how risk is presented in news articles and media\n    - B: Understanding how risk is presented in news articles and media\n    - C: Considering only one perspective\n    - D: Ignoring individual circumstances\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) When deciding whether a 40% relative risk reduction in heart attacks is worth the potential side effects of a medication, what should an individual consider?\n    - A: Only the relative risk reduction\n    - B: Only the absolute risk reduction\n    - C: Both the relative and absolute risks, as well as individual circumstances and potential side effects\n    - D: Neither relative nor absolute risks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) When deciding whether a small absolute risk of shark attack is worth avoiding, what should an individual consider?\n    - A: Only the relative risk\n    - B: Only the absolute risk\n    - C: Both the relative and absolute risks, as well as individual circumstances and benefits\n    - D: Neither relative nor absolute risks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more significant refinement is needed. The questions are now clear, concise, and align with the key concepts in the transcript."
