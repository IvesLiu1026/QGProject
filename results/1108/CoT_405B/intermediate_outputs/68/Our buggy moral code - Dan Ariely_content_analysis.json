The speaker was burned badly and spent time in the hospital, where he observed irrational behavior from nurses.\n2. The speaker conducted experiments to test the optimal way to remove bandages from burn patients.\n3. The speaker studied cheating and found that many people cheat a little bit, but not excessively.\n4. The speaker conducted experiments using a carpenter's vise, electrical shocks, and a pain suit to test pain tolerance.\n5. The speaker found that people are more likely to cheat when they are paid in tokens rather than cash.\n6. The speaker conducted an experiment where an actor pretended to cheat, and the results showed that people were more likely to cheat when they saw someone from their in-group cheating.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The speaker's experience in the hospital led him to question the nurses' method of removing bandages, which he believed was causing unnecessary pain.\n2. The speaker's experiments showed that people's intuitions about pain and cheating are often wrong.\n3. The speaker found that people are more likely to cheat when they are removed from the consequences of their actions (e.g., when paid in tokens rather than cash).\n4. The speaker's experiments demonstrated that social norms play a significant role in influencing people's behavior, particularly when it comes to cheating.\n5. The speaker's work in behavioral economics aims to test people's intuitions and challenge assumptions about human behavior.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. The speaker's research on pain tolerance could be applied to medical settings to improve patient care.\n2. The speaker's findings on cheating could be applied to business and finance to prevent dishonest behavior.\n3. The speaker's work on social norms and cheating could be applied to education and policy-making to promote honesty and integrity.\n4. The speaker's use of predictive analytics could be applied to various industries, such as manufacturing and energy, to improve maintenance and reduce costs.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The speaker identified a relationship between the method of removing bandages and the level of pain experienced by patients.\n2. The speaker found a correlation between the level of cheating and the distance from the consequences of cheating (e.g., being paid in tokens rather than cash).\n3. The speaker identified a cause-and-effect relationship between social norms and cheating behavior.\n4. The speaker analyzed the role of intuitions in shaping people's behavior and decision-making.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The speaker combined insights from psychology, economics, and social norms to develop a new understanding of human behavior.\n2. The speaker integrated his research on pain tolerance and cheating to develop a broader understanding of human irrationality.\n3. The speaker synthesized his findings to develop a new approach to behavioral economics that emphasizes the importance of testing intuitions.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The speaker evaluated the effectiveness of the nurses' method of removing bandages and found it to be suboptimal.\n2. The speaker assessed the impact of social norms on cheating behavior and found that they play a significant role.\n3. The speaker critiqued the assumption that people's intuitions are always correct and argued that they should be tested through experimentation.\n4. The speaker justified the need for a more systematic approach to behavioral economics that emphasizes experimentation and data analysis."
