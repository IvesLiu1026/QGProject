    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. The Constitutional Convention took place in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787.\n2. The Declaration of Independence was written in the same location 11 years earlier.\n3. The framers of the Constitution debated the structure of the executive department.\n4. The framers considered having one person or three people in the executive role.\n5. The first Constitutional Convention did not consider a woman or African American as a potential president.\n6. The framers wanted a president who could act quickly and decisively, with \"energy and dispatch.\"\n7. The president's powers are outlined in Article 2 of the Constitution.\n8. The president is chosen by electors, with the House of Representatives as a backup.\n9. The first compromises included counting slaves as 3/5 of a person and giving the president command of the army.\n10. The president was initially allowed unlimited four-year terms.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The Constitutional Convention aimed to create a new government for the United States.\n2. The framers were concerned about the potential for a monarch-like figure with unchecked powers.\n3. The concept of a president was developed as a compromise between the need for decisive leadership and the fear of a monarch.\n4. The system of electors was chosen to select the president, rather than direct popular vote or legislative selection.\n5. The Constitution has undergone amendments to address some of the initial compromises.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. How might the system of government be redesigned to address modern concerns, such as campaign finance reform or electoral college reform?\n2. What are the implications of the president's role as commander-in-chief, and how has this power been exercised in different historical contexts?\n3. How might the concept of \"energy and dispatch\" be applied in different crisis scenarios, such as natural disasters or economic emergencies?\n4. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of having a president with a strong personality and leadership style, versus a more collaborative approach?\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. How did the framers' experiences with the British monarchy influence their design of the presidency?\n2. What were the trade-offs between the need for decisive leadership and the fear of unchecked power?\n3. How did the compromise on slavery (counting slaves as 3/5 of a person) reflect the conflicting values of the framers?\n4. What are the implications of having a system of government that is designed to prevent a monarch-like figure, but also allows for a strong executive role?\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas to form new understanding)**\n\n1. How might the concept of \"energy and dispatch\" be balanced with the need for deliberation and collaboration in government?\n2. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of having a president who is both a strong leader and a collaborative partner with Congress?\n3. How might the system of government be redesigned to address the concerns of marginalized groups, such as women and African Americans, who were excluded from the initial Constitutional Convention?\n4. What are the implications of having a president who is both a domestic leader and a global representative of the United States?\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Was the compromise on slavery (counting slaves as 3/5 of a person) morally justifiable, given the context of the time?\n2. Is the system of electors still an effective way to select the president, or are there better alternatives?\n3. How might the president's role as commander-in-chief be evaluated in terms of its impact on civil liberties and national security?\n4. What are the implications of having a president who is seen as too strong or too weak, and how might this impact the balance of power in government?"
