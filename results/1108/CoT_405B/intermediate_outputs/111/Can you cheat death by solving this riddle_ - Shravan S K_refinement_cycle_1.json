    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary objective of the game against Death?\n    - A: Reach the exit in exactly 10 turns.\n    - B: Reach the exit before the other player.\n    - C: Reach the exit in fewer turns than Death.\n    - D: Use all the ladders in the game.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What happens to a snake or ladder after it is used by a player?\n    - A: It becomes available to the other player.\n    - B: It disappears and becomes inaccessible.\n    - C: It stays in the same position.\n    - D: It moves to a different location.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the limitation of relying solely on ladders to reach the exit in the game?\n    - A: It is too slow and takes many turns.\n    - B: It is not sufficient to reach the exit in 5 moves.\n    - C: It is too fast and skips important rooms.\n    - D: It is only available to one player.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What approach can help find a 5-roll path to the exit in the game?\n    - A: Working forwards from the starting point.\n    - B: Working backwards from the exit.\n    - C: Using only ladders.\n    - D: Using only snakes.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) In what type of situations can the problem-solving approach of using snakes and ladders be applied?\n    - A: Only in board games.\n    - B: In situations where unconventional thinking is required.\n    - C: In situations where speed is the primary goal.\n    - D: In situations where there are no obstacles.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What type of system can the problem-solving approach of using snakes and ladders help navigate?\n    - A: A simple system with no obstacles.\n    - B: A complex system with obstacles and limitations.\n    - C: A system with only ladders.\n    - D: A system with only snakes.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How does the use of snakes and ladders affect each other in the game?\n    - A: They are independent and do not affect each other.\n    - B: The use of one can affect the availability of the other.\n    - C: They are only used separately.\n    - D: They are only used together.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the contrast between the initial approach and the counterintuitive approach in the game?\n    - A: The initial approach is faster, while the counterintuitive approach is slower.\n    - B: The initial approach uses ladders, while the counterintuitive approach uses snakes.\n    - C: The initial approach is more efficient, while the counterintuitive approach is less efficient.\n    - D: The initial approach is more complex, while the counterintuitive approach is simpler.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What does the solution to the game involve?\n    - A: Using only ladders in a specific sequence.\n    - B: Using only snakes in a specific sequence.\n    - C: Combining the use of snakes and ladders in a specific sequence.\n    - D: Using neither snakes nor ladders.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What new understanding does the problem-solving approach reveal in the game?\n    - A: That using ladders is always the best approach.\n    - B: That using snakes is always the best approach.\n    - C: That sometimes taking a step back can lead to a more efficient solution.\n    - D: That the game is impossible to solve.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What must the player evaluate when deciding whether to use a snake or ladder in the game?\n    - A: Only the potential benefits for their progress.\n    - B: Only the potential risks for their progress.\n    - C: The potential risks and benefits for their progress and their opponent's progress.\n    - D: Neither the potential risks nor benefits.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What must the player do to overcome the limitations of the game?\n    - A: Critique their opponent's strategy.\n    - B: Critique their initial approach and adapt their strategy.\n    - C: Justify their decision to use a specific sequence.\n    - D: Ignore the limitations and continue with their initial approach.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
