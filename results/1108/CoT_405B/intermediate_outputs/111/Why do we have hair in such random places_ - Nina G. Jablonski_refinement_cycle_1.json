    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What protein is human hair and animal fur primarily composed of?\n    - A: Collagen\n    - B: Keratin\n    - C: Elastin\n    - D: Fibrin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which type of glands produce oily, smelly secretions in armpits, nipples, and pubic areas?\n    - A: Eccrine glands\n    - B: Apocrine glands\n    - C: Sebaceous glands\n    - D: Merocrine glands\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What lifestyle change led to the development of more sweat glands in early humans?\n    - A: Transition from a more active lifestyle to a sedentary one\n    - B: Transition from trees to a more active lifestyle\n    - C: Development of thicker body hair\n    - D: Loss of eyebrows and eyelashes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the primary function of thicker, longer-growing hair on the human head?\n    - A: To protect the scalp and brain from cold temperatures\n    - B: To protect the scalp and brain from overheating\n    - C: To aid in communication and expression\n    - D: To minimize airflow over the eyeballs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A clothing designer wants to create a temperature-regulating jacket. What aspect of human biology should they consider when designing the jacket?\n    - A: The structure of human muscles\n    - B: The function of human hair in temperature regulation\n    - C: The development of apocrine glands\n    - D: The importance of eyebrows in communication\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A psychologist is studying the role of facial expressions in communication. Which facial feature should they focus on due to its location on active facial muscles?\n    - A: Eyelashes\n    - B: Eyebrows\n    - C: Nose\n    - D: Lips\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the transition to a more active lifestyle and the loss of fur in early humans?\n    - A: The transition to a more active lifestyle led to the growth of thicker body hair.\n    - B: The transition to a more active lifestyle led to the loss of fur, which allowed for more efficient heat loss through sweating.\n    - C: The loss of fur led to the transition to a more active lifestyle.\n    - D: The transition to a more active lifestyle had no effect on the loss of fur.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How has human hair been modified compared to animal fur?\n    - A: Human hair is primarily used for insulation, while animal fur is used for communication.\n    - B: Human hair is primarily used for communication, while animal fur is used for insulation.\n    - C: Human hair has been modified for different purposes, such as temperature regulation and communication.\n    - D: Animal fur has been modified for different purposes, unlike human hair.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What new insights can be gained by combining the knowledge of human hair's purpose with the understanding of its structure?\n    - A: The importance of eyebrows in communication\n    - B: The function of apocrine glands\n    - C: New perspectives on the evolution of human hair and its role in human biology\n    - D: The role of eyelashes in minimizing airflow\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What comprehensive understanding can be gained by integrating the functions of different types of human hair?\n    - A: The role of human hair in regulating body temperature\n    - B: The importance of understanding human hair in the context of human biology and evolution\n    - C: A comprehensive understanding of the role of hair in human biology, including its functions in temperature regulation, communication, and identification.\n    - D: The relevance of human hair in modern human society\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) How effective is human hair in regulating body temperature?\n    - A: Very effective, as it provides excellent insulation\n    - B: Somewhat effective, as it aids in heat loss through sweating and protects the scalp from overheating\n    - C: Not very effective, as it has a limited role in temperature regulation\n    - D: Not at all effective, as it has no role in temperature regulation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Why is it important to understand human hair in the context of human biology and evolution?\n    - A: Because it provides insight into the evolution of animal fur\n    - B: Because it aids in the development of hair care products\n    - C: Because it provides a comprehensive understanding of human biology and evolution, including the adaptations that have shaped the human body.\n    - D: Because it has no significance in modern human society\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor changes to the questions to enhance clarity and conciseness, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also rephrased some of the questions to better align with the key concepts in the transcript."
