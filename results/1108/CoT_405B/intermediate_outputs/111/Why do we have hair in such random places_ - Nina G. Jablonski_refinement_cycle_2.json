What aspect of human biology should they consider when designing the jacket?\n    - A: The structure of human muscles\n    - B: The function of human hair in temperature regulation\n    - C: The development of apocrine glands\n    - D: The importance of eyebrows in communication\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A psychologist is studying the role of facial expressions in communication. Which facial feature should they focus on due to its location on active facial muscles?\n    - A: Eyelashes\n    - B: Eyebrows\n    - C: Nose\n    - D: Lips\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the transition to a more active lifestyle and the loss of fur in early humans?\n    - A: The transition to a more active lifestyle led to the growth of thicker body hair.\n    - B: The transition to a more active lifestyle led to the loss of fur, which allowed for more efficient heat loss through sweating.\n    - C: The loss of fur led to the transition to a more active lifestyle.\n    - D: The transition to a more active lifestyle had no effect on the loss of fur.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How has human hair been modified compared to animal fur?\n    - A: Human hair is primarily used for insulation, while animal fur is used for communication.\n    - B: Human hair is primarily used for communication, while animal fur is used for insulation.\n    - C: Human hair has been modified for different purposes, such as temperature regulation and communication.\n    - D: Animal fur has been modified for different purposes, unlike human hair.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be inferred about the evolution of human hair based on its structure and functions?\n    - A: Human hair evolved solely for insulation purposes.\n    - B: Human hair evolved solely for communication purposes.\n    - C: Human hair evolved to serve multiple purposes, including temperature regulation, communication, and identification.\n    - D: Human hair has no significant role in human biology.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What comprehensive understanding can be gained by integrating the functions of different types of human hair?\n    - A: The role of human hair in regulating body temperature\n    - B: The importance of understanding human hair in the context of human biology and evolution\n    - C: A comprehensive understanding of the role of hair in human biology, including its functions in temperature regulation, communication, and identification.\n    - D: The relevance of human hair in modern human society\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) How effective is human hair in regulating body temperature?\n    - A: Very effective, as it provides excellent insulation\n    - B: Somewhat effective, as it aids in heat loss through sweating and protects the scalp from overheating\n    - C: Not very effective, as it has a limited role in temperature regulation\n    - D: Not at all effective, as it has no role in temperature regulation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Why is it important to understand human hair in the context of human biology and evolution?\n    - A: Because it provides insight into the evolution of animal fur\n    - B: Because it aids in the development of hair care products\n    - C: Because it provides a comprehensive understanding of human biology and evolution, including the adaptations that have shaped the human body.\n    - D: Because it has no significance in modern human society\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined questions 1-12 align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. No more refinement needed."
