    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the world's sharks live in marine forests?\n    - A: 20%\n    - B: 35%\n    - C: 50%\n    - D: 60%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) How many tonnes of carbon do marine forests sequester every year?\n    - A: 100 million tonnes\n    - B: 310 million tonnes\n    - C: 500 million tonnes\n    - D: 1 billion tonnes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What role do mangrove forests play in the ecosystem?\n    - A: They provide food for sharks.\n    - B: They provide shelter for sharks.\n    - C: They serve as a habitat for sharks and provide them with food and shelter.\n    - D: They have no role in the ecosystem.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make options A and B more specific.\n\n4) What is the relationship between sharks and marine forests?\n    - A: Sharks are the primary predators in marine forests.\n    - B: Sharks have no impact on the ecosystem.\n    - C: The relationship between sharks and marine forests is interdependent.\n    - D: Sharks are only prey in marine forests.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make option A more specific.\n\n5) How can understanding the importance of mangrove forests as a habitat for sharks inform conservation efforts?\n    - A: By prioritizing the protection of other marine ecosystems.\n    - B: By developing strategies to mitigate the impact of human activities on mangrove forests.\n    - C: By developing strategies to preserve and restore mangrove forests.\n    - D: By only protecting shark populations.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make option B more specific.\n\n6) What can the unique adaptations of mangroves inspire?\n    - A: Innovative solutions for managing water and salt levels in other environments.\n    - B: New methods for sustainable coastal development.\n    - C: The destruction of other marine ecosystems.\n    - D: The decline of shark populations.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make option B more plausible.\n\n7) What type of relationship exists between sharks and marine forests?\n    - A: Symbiotic relationship\n    - B: Predator-prey relationship\n    - C: Mutualistic relationship\n    - D: Competitive relationship\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make option C more specific.\n\n8) What can the decline of shark populations and the destruction of marine forests have on the ecosystem?\n    - A: No impact\n    - B: Only positive effects\n    - C: Cascading effects on the entire ecosystem\n    - D: Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make option D more specific.\n\n9) What can the combination of mangrove forests and sharks be seen as?\n    - A: A model for understanding the complex relationships between species and their environments.\n    - B: A simple predator-prey relationship.\n    - C: A key component of coastal ecosystem health.\n    - D: No relationship between species.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make option C more plausible.\n\n10) How can the carbon sequestration potential of marine forests be used?\n    - A: As a standalone solution to climate change.\n    - B: Integrated with other climate change mitigation strategies.\n    - C: To offset the impacts of coastal development.\n    - D: Only to protect shark populations.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make option C more plausible.\n\n11) How can the decline of shark populations and the destruction of marine forests be evaluated?\n    - A: As a minor conservation issue.\n    - B: As a critical conservation issue requiring immediate attention and action.\n    - C: As a key indicator of ecosystem health.\n    - D: Only in terms of their economic costs.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make option C more plausible.\n\n12) What should be considered when evaluating the trade-offs between coastal development and the preservation of marine forests?\n    - A: Only economic costs and benefits.\n    - B: Only environmental costs and benefits.\n    - C: Economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits.\n    - D: The impact on shark populations.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed."
