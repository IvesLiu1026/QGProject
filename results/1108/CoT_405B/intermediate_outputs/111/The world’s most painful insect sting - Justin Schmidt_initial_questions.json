Schmidt\n    - C: Biologist John Doe\n    - D: Zoologist Jane Johnson\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the name of the pain-causing peptide found in the Western honeybee's sting?\n    - A: Poneratoxin\n    - B: Melittin\n    - C: Apitoxin\n    - D: Vespidotoxin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What is the purpose of the tarantula hawk wasp's sting?\n    - A: To kill tarantulas\n    - B: To immobilize tarantulas and lay an egg on the spider\n    - C: To defend against predators\n    - D: To attract mates\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What can be a result of the Western honeybee's sting?\n    - A: Permanent paralysis\n    - B: Discomfort and allergic reactions\n    - C: Instant death\n    - D: No reaction at all\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-World Scenarios)**\n\n1) Why is it important to understand the pain caused by different insect stings?\n    - A: To develop new insecticides\n    - B: To take precautions when interacting with these creatures\n    - C: To study the evolution of insect stings\n    - D: To learn about insect habitats\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What can studying the evolution of insect stings provide insights into?\n    - A: The development of simple societies\n    - B: The development of complex societies\n    - C: The evolution of insect habitats\n    - D: The evolution of insect defense mechanisms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, Contrasts, Cause-and-Effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the tarantula hawk wasp's sting and its ability to immobilize tarantulas?\n    - A: The sting is used to kill tarantulas\n    - B: The sting is used to immobilize tarantulas, allowing the wasp to lay an egg on the spider\n    - C: The sting has no effect on tarantulas\n    - D: The sting is used to attract tarantulas\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a key contrast between the bullet ant's sting and the Western honeybee's sting?\n    - A: The bullet ant's sting is less painful than the Western honeybee's sting\n    - B: The bullet ant's sting is more painful and longer-lasting than the Western honeybee's sting\n    - C: The bullet ant's sting is used for defense, while the Western honeybee's sting is used for offense\n    - D: The bullet ant's sting is used for offense, while the Western honeybee's sting is used for defense\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1) What can the combination of the sting pain index and the understanding of insect defense mechanisms inform?\n    - A: Strategies for mitigating the impact of insect stings\n    - B: The evolution of insect habitats\n    - C: The development of complex societies\n    - D: The evolution of insect defense mechanisms\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What can the comparison of different insect stings lead to?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind pain and defense\n    - B: A better understanding of insect habitats\n    - C: A new understanding of the evolution of complex societies\n    - D: A new understanding of the evolution of insect defense mechanisms\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, Critique, Justification)**\n\n1) What can be a critique of the sting pain index?\n    - A: It is too subjective and may not accurately rank the pain of different insect stings\n    - B: It is too objective and may not take into account individual differences in pain perception\n    - C: It is only based on a small sample of insect stings\n    - D: It is the most accurate measure of insect sting pain\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What can be a justification for the use of certain defense mechanisms by insects, such as the bullet ant's sting?\n    - A: It is an effective way to defend against predators\n    - B: It is a necessary adaptation for survival in certain environments\n    - C: It is a result of evolutionary pressures\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D"
