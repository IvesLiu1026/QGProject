What data could they use to inform their decisions about a rider's capabilities?\n    - A: Rider weight\n    - B: Rider height\n    - C: Power output\n    - D: Rider experience\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between drafting and energy conservation in cycling, particularly during long, flat stages?\n    - A: Drafting increases energy expenditure\n    - B: Drafting has no effect on energy conservation\n    - C: Drafting reduces energy expenditure\n    - D: Drafting only conserves energy on flat stages\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How do the physical demands of long, flat stages differ from those of mountain climbs in the Tour de France, in terms of the need for high power output?\n    - A: The need for high power output is similar between the two\n    - B: The need for endurance is similar between the two\n    - C: The need for high power output is greater on mountain climbs\n    - D: The need for endurance is greater on long, flat stages\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a unique aspect of the Tour de France competition, combining physical and strategic elements to determine the winner?\n    - A: The emphasis on individual performance\n    - B: The lack of strategic elements\n    - C: The combination of physical and strategic elements\n    - D: The focus on sprinting\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How has the use of data and technology impacted the Tour de France, particularly in terms of understanding the physical demands of the competition?\n    - A: It has reduced the importance of teamwork\n    - B: It has increased the emphasis on individual performance\n    - C: It has provided new insights into the physical demands of the competition\n    - D: It has decreased the need for strategic decision-making\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a key factor in evaluating the effectiveness of different team strategies in the Tour de France, particularly in terms of balancing energy levels and making tactical decisions?\n    - A: The number of riders on the team\n    - B: The experience of the team manager\n    - C: The ability to balance energy levels and make tactical decisions\n    - D: The emphasis on individual performance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a justification for the use of drafting as a tactic in the Tour de France, particularly in terms of conserving energy and improving performance?\n    - A: It increases the risk of crashes\n    - B: It reduces the need for physical conditioning\n    - C: It conserves energy and improves performance\n    - D: It decreases the importance of teamwork\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo significant changes were made to the questions, but some minor adjustments were made to improve clarity and concision. The distractors remain plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers remain accurate."
