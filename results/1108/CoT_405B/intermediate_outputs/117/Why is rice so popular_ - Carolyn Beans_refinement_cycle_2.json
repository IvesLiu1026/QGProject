    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of global cropland is dedicated to rice cultivation?\n    - A: 5%\n    - B: 8%\n    - C: 11%\n    - D: 15%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) According to many plant geneticists, where did Asian rice originate?\n    - A: Africa\n    - B: South America\n    - C: What's now China\n    - D: India\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the significance of rice in various cuisines and cultures around the world?\n    - A: It is a staple food source, but has little cultural significance.\n    - B: It is a luxury food item, reserved for special occasions.\n    - C: It plays a central role in the cuisine and cultural heritage of many societies.\n    - D: It is primarily used as a food source for animals.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the traditional method of growing rice, and what is its environmental impact?\n    - A: Growing rice in dry fields, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions.\n    - B: Growing rice in paddy fields, which contributes to methane emissions.\n    - C: Growing rice in greenhouses, which has a neutral environmental impact.\n    - D: Growing rice in flooded fields, which reduces water usage.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A farmer wants to reduce their water usage and methane emissions while growing rice. What technique could they use?\n    - A: Alternate wetting and drying\n    - B: Continuous flooding\n    - C: Crop rotation\n    - D: Irrigation scheduling\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What area of research could a researcher explore to improve crop yields and reduce the environmental impact of rice cultivation?\n    - A: Genetic diversity of rice\n    - B: Soil quality and fertilizers\n    - C: Water management strategies\n    - D: Pest control methods\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between rice cultivation and greenhouse gas emissions?\n    - A: Rice cultivation reduces greenhouse gas emissions.\n    - B: Rice cultivation has no impact on greenhouse gas emissions.\n    - C: Rice cultivation contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane.\n    - D: Rice cultivation only contributes to greenhouse gas emissions in certain regions.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between flooded paddy fields and methane emissions?\n    - A: Flooded paddy fields reduce methane emissions by allowing oxygen to penetrate the soil.\n    - B: Flooded paddy fields have no impact on methane emissions.\n    - C: Flooded paddy fields contribute to methane emissions by creating an anaerobic environment.\n    - D: Flooded paddy fields only contribute to methane emissions in certain climates.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How could traditional knowledge and modern technology be combined to develop sustainable agricultural practices in rice cultivation?\n    - A: By using traditional farming methods and ignoring modern technology.\n    - B: By adopting modern technology and abandoning traditional knowledge.\n    - C: By integrating traditional knowledge of crop rotation and soil quality with modern technology, such as precision irrigation.\n    - D: By using traditional knowledge to develop new pesticides and fertilizers.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the effectiveness of alternate wetting and drying as a sustainable rice cultivation method?\n    - A: It is not effective in reducing water usage and methane emissions.\n    - B: It is moderately effective, but only in certain climates.\n    - C: It is highly effective in reducing water usage and methane emissions, with no impact on yield.\n    - D: It is only effective in reducing water usage, but not methane emissions.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the potential consequence of not adopting sustainable rice cultivation methods on a global scale?\n    - A: There will be no significant impact on the environment.\n    - B: There will be a moderate impact on the environment, but it can be mitigated.\n    - C: There will be a significant impact on the environment, including increased greenhouse gas emissions and water scarcity.\n    - D: There will be a significant impact on the environment, but only in certain regions.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the approximate percentage of human-caused methane emissions attributed to rice cultivation?\n    - A: 5%\n    - B: 8%\n    - C: 12%\n    - D: 15%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-11. Question 12 was added to cover a key concept mentioned in the transcript."
