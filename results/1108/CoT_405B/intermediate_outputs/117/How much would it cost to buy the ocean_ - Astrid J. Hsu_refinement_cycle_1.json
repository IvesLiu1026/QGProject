    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and have accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the Earth's surface is covered by the ocean?\n    - A: 40%\n    - B: 50%\n    - C: 60%\n    - D: 70%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How many people are employed by the global fishing industry annually?\n    - A: 100 million people\n    - B: 200 million people\n    - C: 260 million people\n    - D: 300 million people\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary importance of the ocean to the global economy and ecosystem?\n    - A: Providing a source of freshwater\n    - B: Supporting global trade, generating oxygen, and providing food and energy\n    - C: Regulating the Earth's temperature\n    - D: Producing fossil fuels\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What are the main impacts of human activities on the ocean?\n    - A: Increased biodiversity and productivity\n    - B: Improved water quality and reduced pollution\n    - C: Climate change, pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction\n    - D: Enhanced coastal protection and reduced erosion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A local fishing community wants to develop sustainable fishing practices to maintain the ocean's productivity. What approach should they take?\n    - A: Increase the number of fishing vessels and gear\n    - B: Implement catch limits, closed seasons, and marine protected areas\n    - C: Focus on catching high-value species only\n    - D: Reduce the size of the fishing area\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A company wants to invest in renewable energy to reduce its carbon footprint. What option should they consider?\n    - A: Offshore oil drilling\n    - B: Onshore wind farms\n    - C: Offshore wind farms, tidal energy harvesting, and wave energy\n    - D: Nuclear power plants\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between human activities and the ocean's health?\n    - A: Human activities have no impact on the ocean's health\n    - B: Human activities have a positive impact on the ocean's health\n    - C: Human activities have a negative impact on the ocean's health\n    - D: The relationship is unclear and requires further research\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the contrast between the ocean's economic value and its intrinsic value as a natural system?\n    - A: The ocean's economic value is higher than its intrinsic value\n    - B: The ocean's intrinsic value is higher than its economic value\n    - C: The ocean's economic value and intrinsic value are equal\n    - D: The contrast is irrelevant and should not be considered\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can economic and environmental considerations be combined to develop sustainable management practices for the ocean?\n    - A: By prioritizing economic growth over environmental concerns\n    - B: By integrating traditional knowledge, modern technology, and stakeholder engagement to promote eco-friendly practices\n    - C: By focusing on short-term gains rather than long-term sustainability\n    - D: By ignoring the impact of human activities on the ocean\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What approach can be taken to promote the importance of ocean conservation and sustainable management?\n    - A: Creating education and awareness programs, and engaging local communities\n    - B: Implementing strict regulations and enforcement\n    - C: Providing financial incentives for sustainable practices\n    - D: Ignoring the issue and focusing on other priorities\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential consequence of valuing the ocean solely in monetary terms?\n    - A: Increased investment in ocean conservation\n    - B: Improved management of marine ecosystems\n    - C: Overemphasis on economic benefits at the expense of environmental concerns\n    - D: Reduced human impact on the ocean\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How effective are sustainable management practices in maintaining the ocean's health and productivity?\n    - A: Very effective, with no room for improvement\n    - B: Somewhat effective, but requiring ongoing evaluation, improvement, and adaptive management\n    - C: Not effective, with a need for new approaches\n    - D: Unclear, requiring further research and analysis\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity, concision, and accuracy. I also ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and that the correct answers are accurate and aligned with the key concepts in the transcript. No major changes were necessary, and the questions are now refined and ready for use."
