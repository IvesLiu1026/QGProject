    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who conducted a 1969 study on the effects of intoxication on memory recall?\n    - A: Dr. Donald Goodwin\n    - B: Dr. Benjamin Rush\n    - C: Dr. Sigmund Freud\n    - D: Dr. Ivan Pavlov\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Which chemical compound in alcohol is primarily responsible for its effects on the brain?\n    - A: Methanol\n    - B: Ethanol\n    - C: Propanol\n    - D: Butanol\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) How does ethanol affect the brain's ability to transfer information between neurons?\n    - A: It completely blocks information transfer\n    - B: It partially impairs information transfer\n    - C: It has no effect on information transfer\n    - D: It enhances information transfer\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the effect of ethanol on the communication between neurons in the brain?\n    - A: It completely blocks neural communication\n    - B: It partially impairs neural communication\n    - C: It has no effect on neural communication\n    - D: It enhances neural communication\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is the role of long-term potentiation (LTP) in memory storage?\n    - A: It is a process involved in forgetting\n    - B: It is a process involved in memory retrieval\n    - C: It is a process involved in strengthening neural connections to form memories\n    - D: It is a process involved in learning\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is the effect of ethanol on the brain's networks that control memory?\n    - A: Ethanol has no effect on the brain's memory networks\n    - B: Ethanol enhances the brain's memory networks\n    - C: Ethanol disrupts the brain's memory networks, leading to memory impairment\n    - D: Ethanol has a selective effect on the brain's memory networks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the cause-and-effect connection between ethanol and the disruption of LTP?\n    - A: Ethanol has no effect on LTP\n    - B: Ethanol enhances LTP\n    - C: Ethanol disrupts LTP, leading to memory impairment\n    - D: LTP disrupts ethanol's effects on the brain\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) At what blood alcohol concentration (BAC) do blackouts typically occur?\n    - A: 0.08\n    - B: 0.12\n    - C: 0.16\n    - D: 0.20\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a potential consequence of repeatedly over-drinking on the brain?\n    - A: Permanent impairment of memory\n    - B: Temporary impairment of memory\n    - C: Enhanced cognitive function\n    - D: No effect on cognitive function\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) Why are teenagers more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol on the brain?\n    - A: Due to their smaller body size\n    - B: Due to the substantial changes in brain development during those years\n    - C: Due to their lack of drinking experience\n    - D: Due to their genetic predisposition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What can understanding the effects of alcohol on the brain help individuals do?\n    - A: Make informed decisions about their drinking habits\n    - B: Ignore the risks associated with excessive drinking\n    - C: Develop a tolerance to alcohol's effects\n    - D: Drink more responsibly\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What can recognizing the signs of a blackout help individuals do?\n    - A: Take steps to prevent harm to themselves or others\n    - B: Continue drinking without concern\n    - C: Call for emergency services\n    - D: Try to recall the events of the blackout\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 13-19 as they were redundant or not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript. The refined questions are clear, concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors."
