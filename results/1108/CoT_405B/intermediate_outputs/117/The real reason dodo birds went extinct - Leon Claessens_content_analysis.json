    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. Dodos originated from tropical pigeons from Southeast Asia that traveled across the Indian Ocean.\n2. The island of Mauritius was formed about 8 million years ago by an underwater volcano.\n3. Dodos were among the largest animals on Mauritius, reaching just under a meter tall.\n4. Dodos survived a megadrought on Mauritius around 4,300 years ago.\n5. Dutch sailors arrived on Mauritius in 1598 and introduced invasive species like macaques, goats, pigs, and rats.\n6. The concept of extinction was not conclusively demonstrated until the 1790s.\n7. Dodos were last seen less than a century after Dutch arrival.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The dodo's lack of defensive adaptations, such as flight, was due to the absence of large predators on Mauritius.\n2. The introduction of invasive species by Dutch sailors led to the decline of the dodo population.\n3. The dodo's brain size relative to its body was similar to that of other pigeons, contradicting the notion that they were less intelligent.\n4. Dodos were well-adapted to their environment, which could fluctuate between extreme dry and wet conditions.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. The introduction of invasive species can have devastating effects on native ecosystems, as seen in the case of the dodo.\n2. The concept of extinction can be applied to modern conservation efforts, highlighting the importance of protecting endangered species.\n3. The story of the dodo can serve as a cautionary tale for the impact of human activities on the environment.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and contrasts)**\n\n1. The relationship between the introduction of invasive species and the decline of the dodo population.\n2. The contrast between the dodo's adaptation to its environment and its inability to cope with the sudden introduction of invasive species.\n3. The comparison between the dodo's brain size and that of other pigeons, challenging the notion that they were less intelligent.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. The combination of the dodo's lack of defensive adaptations and the introduction of invasive species led to their extinction.\n2. The story of the dodo can be seen as a symbol of the impact of human activities on the environment, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.\n3. The concept of extinction can be linked to the idea of human responsibility for the protection of endangered species.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n1. The portrayal of dodos as \"brainless, blundering birds\" is a misconception that can be challenged by examining the facts.\n2. The introduction of invasive species by Dutch sailors can be criticized as a reckless and irresponsible act.\n3. The delayed recognition of the concept of extinction can be seen as a failure of scientific understanding at the time."
