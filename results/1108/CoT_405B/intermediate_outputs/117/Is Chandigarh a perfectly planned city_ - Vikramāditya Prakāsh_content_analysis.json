Over 10 million residents were displaced, and around 1 million people died during the riots.\n3. Jawaharlal Nehru was India's first prime minister.\n4. Chandigarh was built with a budget of 175 million rupees (approximately 500 million US dollars).\n5. American architect Albert Mayer was initially commissioned for the project.\n6. French architect Le Corbusier took over the project after Mayer left.\n7. Le Corbusier prioritized functional designs devoid of ornamentation.\n8. The city's plan was divided into sections, including the head (administrative area), circulatory system (roads and pathways), heart (commercial district), and lungs (Leisure Valley).\n9. The city's structures were built using brick and concrete, with an emphasis on passive cooling and ventilation.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1. Nehru's vision for a united India led to the construction of Chandigarh as a symbol of the nation's faith in the future.\n2. The city's design was innovative and inspiring, with a focus on green spaces, sectioned neighborhoods, and organized traffic systems.\n3. Le Corbusier's style emphasized functional designs over decoration, using unornamented concrete to create efficient structures.\n4. The city's plan was designed to be eco-friendly, with passive cooling and ventilation built into every structure.\n5. Chandigarh's design has made it one of India's greenest cities, with a high quality of life.\n\n**Application**:\n\n1. The concept of designing cities with green spaces and organized traffic systems can be applied to modern urban planning.\n2. The use of passive cooling and ventilation in Chandigarh's structures can be applied to building design in tropical cities.\n3. The idea of creating a city with a strong focus on residential and government buildings can be applied to urban planning in developing countries.\n4. The concept of using metaphors (e.g., the human body) to describe and design urban environments can be applied to urban planning and architecture.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. The relationship between Nehru's vision for a united India and the construction of Chandigarh as a symbol of that vision.\n2. The contrast between Le Corbusier's functional design style and the ornate designs of other architects.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the city's design and its eco-friendly features.\n4. The impact of the city's hierarchy of housing types on segregation between affluent and lower-income households.\n5. The trade-off between the city's focus on residential and government buildings and the development of other industries.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1. Combining the ideas of green spaces, sectioned neighborhoods, and organized traffic systems to create a comprehensive urban plan.\n2. Integrating passive cooling and ventilation techniques into building design to create eco-friendly structures.\n3. Using metaphors to describe and design urban environments, such as the human body metaphor used in Chandigarh's design.\n4. Balancing the need for residential and government buildings with the need for other industries and services in urban planning.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of Chandigarh's design in achieving Nehru's vision for a united India.\n2. Assessing the impact of Le Corbusier's design style on the city's aesthetic and functionality.\n3. Justifying the decision to prioritize residential and government buildings over other industries in Chandigarh's design.\n4. Critiquing the city's hierarchy of housing types and its impact on segregation and social inequality.\n5. Evaluating the eco-friendliness of Chandigarh's design and its potential for replication in other cities."
