    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What was the origin of the tropical pigeons that eventually evolved into dodos?\n    - A: Southeast Asia\n    - B: Africa\n    - C: South America\n    - D: Australia\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Approximately how many years ago was the island of Mauritius formed by an underwater volcano?\n    - A: 4 million years ago\n    - B: 6 million years ago\n    - C: 8 million years ago\n    - D: 10 million years ago\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why did the dodo lack defensive adaptations such as flight?\n    - A: Due to the presence of large predators on Mauritius\n    - B: Due to the absence of large predators on Mauritius\n    - C: Due to the island's extreme climate\n    - D: Due to the dodo's brain size\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What was the primary cause of the decline of the dodo population?\n    - A: The introduction of invasive species by Dutch sailors\n    - B: The dodo's lack of intelligence\n    - C: The island's megadrought\n    - D: Overhunting by humans\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) What is a key lesson from the introduction of invasive species on Mauritius that can be applied to modern conservation efforts?\n    - A: The importance of introducing new species to an ecosystem\n    - B: The need to prioritize economic growth over environmental concerns\n    - C: The devastating effects of invasive species on native ecosystems\n    - D: The irrelevance of human activities on the environment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How can the concept of extinction inform modern conservation efforts?\n    - A: By ignoring the plight of endangered species\n    - B: By prioritizing the protection of only certain species\n    - C: By highlighting the importance of protecting endangered species\n    - D: By assuming that extinction is a natural process\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the introduction of invasive species and the decline of the dodo population?\n    - A: The introduction of invasive species had no impact on the dodo population\n    - B: The introduction of invasive species led to an increase in the dodo population\n    - C: The introduction of invasive species was the primary cause of the decline of the dodo population\n    - D: The decline of the dodo population was due to natural causes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the contrast between the dodo's adaptation to its environment and its inability to cope with the sudden introduction of invasive species?\n    - A: The dodo was well-adapted to its environment and able to cope with invasive species\n    - B: The dodo was poorly adapted to its environment and unable to cope with invasive species\n    - C: The dodo was well-adapted to its environment but unable to cope with the sudden introduction of invasive species\n    - D: The dodo was poorly adapted to its environment but able to cope with invasive species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What combination of factors led to the extinction of the dodo?\n    - A: The introduction of invasive species alone\n    - B: The dodo's lack of defensive adaptations alone\n    - C: The combination of the dodo's lack of defensive adaptations and the introduction of invasive species\n    - D: The island's megadrought and the dodo's size\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can be seen as a symbol of the impact of human activities on the environment?\n    - A: The story of the dodo's adaptation to its environment\n    - B: The introduction of invasive species on Mauritius\n    - C: The story of the dodo's extinction\n    - D: The concept of extinction\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) How can the portrayal of dodos as \"brainless, blundering birds\" be characterized?\n    - A: Accurate and based on scientific evidence\n    - B: A misconception that can be challenged by examining the facts\n    - C: A neutral and unbiased description\n    - D: A necessary simplification for the general public\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) How can the introduction of invasive species by Dutch sailors be characterized?\n    - A: A responsible and necessary act\n    - B: A reckless and irresponsible act\n    - C: A neutral and unintentional act\n    - D: A necessary evil for economic growth\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and concision, but the overall content and correct answers remain the same. No more refinement needed."
