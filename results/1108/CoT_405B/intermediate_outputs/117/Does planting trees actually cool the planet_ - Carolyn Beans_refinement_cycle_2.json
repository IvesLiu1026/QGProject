Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Between 1974 and 2012, the Chilean government helped fund the planting of approximately how many hectares of new trees?\n    - A: 500,000 hectares\n    - B: 1 million hectares\n    - C: 2 million hectares\n    - D: 5 million hectares\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the estimated amount of carbon dioxide that a mature tree can absorb each year?\n    - A: 10 kilograms\n    - B: 15 kilograms\n    - C: 22 kilograms\n    - D: 30 kilograms\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary difference between afforestation and reforestation?\n    - A: Afforestation involves planting non-native tree species, while reforestation involves native species.\n    - B: Afforestation involves planting trees in areas that were never home to forests, while reforestation restores recently degraded forests.\n    - C: Afforestation is a commercial forestry practice, while reforestation is a conservation effort.\n    - D: Afforestation is a short-term solution, while reforestation is a long-term strategy.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What can happen when trees are planted in areas that naturally reflect sunlight, such as drylands or snowy terrain?\n    - A: The trees will absorb more carbon dioxide.\n    - B: The trees will help to reduce the risk of wildfires.\n    - C: The trees will contribute to a cooler planet.\n    - D: The trees will absorb more of the Sun's rays, contributing to a warmer planet.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What is a potential problem with companies investing in tree planting initiatives to offset their emissions?\n    - A: It can lead to increased biodiversity.\n    - B: It can disrupt wildlife habitats.\n    - C: It can allow companies to practice greenwashing.\n    - D: It can reduce carbon emissions.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What technique can be used to promote forest growth and carbon storage by helping nature along?\n    - A: Assisted natural regeneration\n    - B: Clear-cutting\n    - C: Selective logging\n    - D: Agroforestry\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What factors can impact the effectiveness of tree planting initiatives in terms of carbon storage?\n    - A: Tree species, land use, and management practices\n    - B: Climate, soil quality, and water availability\n    - C: Biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being\n    - D: Economic growth, social justice, and environmental sustainability\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is the relationship between tree planting and unintended consequences, such as disrupting wildlife habitats or contributing to a warmer planet?\n    - A: Cause-and-effect connection\n    - B: Correlation but no causation\n    - C: No relationship\n    - D: Positive impact\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) How can tree planting initiatives be made more effective and sustainable?\n    - A: By increasing biodiversity and ecosystem services\n    - B: By promoting sustainable land use and protecting existing forests\n    - C: By reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality\n    - D: By creating jobs and stimulating economic growth\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) Why is it crucial to consider local contexts and needs when implementing tree planting initiatives?\n    - A: To ensure that efforts are tailored to specific contexts and needs\n    - B: To increase public awareness and support\n    - C: To reduce costs and improve efficiency\n    - D: To promote technological innovation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What factors should be considered when judging the effectiveness of tree planting initiatives?\n    - A: Species selection, land use, and long-term protection\n    - B: Climate, soil quality, and water availability\n    - C: Biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being\n    - D: Economic growth, social justice, and environmental sustainability\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) Why is it essential to evaluate the potential unintended consequences of tree planting initiatives?\n    - A: To promote sustainable development and environmental protection\n    - B: To reduce costs and improve efficiency\n    - C: To increase public awareness and support\n    - D: To inform decision-making and prioritize efforts\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nAfter reviewing the questions, I made minor adjustments to improve clarity and concision. The distractors remain plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. No major changes were necessary, and the questions align with the key concepts in the transcript.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
