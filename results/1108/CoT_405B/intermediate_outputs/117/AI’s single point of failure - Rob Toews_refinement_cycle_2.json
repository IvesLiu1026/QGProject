A: It would accelerate the development of AI in China.\n    - B: It would have no impact on the development of AI in China.\n    - C: It would slow down the development of AI in China.\n    - D: It would lead to a complete halt in AI development in China.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How does TSMC's chip manufacturing capabilities compare to those of Samsung and Intel?\n    - A: TSMC is far behind Samsung and Intel in terms of production capabilities.\n    - B: TSMC is on par with Samsung and Intel in terms of production capabilities.\n    - C: TSMC is slightly ahead of Samsung and Intel in terms of production capabilities.\n    - D: TSMC is significantly ahead of Samsung and Intel in terms of production capabilities.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the relationship between TSMC, the US government, and China in the context of the global semiconductor industry?\n    - A: TSMC is a US-based company that exports chips to China.\n    - B: The US government has banned the export of high-end AI chips to China, which relies on TSMC's chips.\n    - C: China has invested heavily in TSMC's chip production facilities.\n    - D: TSMC is a Chinese company that exports chips to the US.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What would be a potential strategy for companies like Samsung and Intel to catch up with TSMC's chip manufacturing capabilities?\n    - A: Investing in research and development to improve their own chip manufacturing capabilities.\n    - B: Partnering with TSMC to gain access to its technology and expertise.\n    - C: Focusing on developing other types of chips that do not require leading-edge manufacturing capabilities.\n    - D: Acquiring smaller chip manufacturers to increase their production capacity.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What would be a potential consequence of a global shortage of AI chips?\n    - A: The development of AI would accelerate as companies would focus on developing more efficient AI algorithms.\n    - B: The development of AI would slow down as companies would struggle to access the necessary hardware.\n    - C: The global semiconductor industry would experience a significant boost in production.\n    - D: The US government would lift its ban on exporting high-end AI chips to China.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a potential limitation of the \"silicon shield\" theory in preventing a Chinese invasion of Taiwan?\n    - A: China's dependence on TSMC's chips would prevent it from invading Taiwan.\n    - B: The theory assumes that China's dependence on TSMC's chips is the only factor that would prevent an invasion.\n    - C: The theory is based on a flawed assumption that China would prioritize its economic interests over its political goals.\n    - D: The theory is not relevant to the current geopolitical situation.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential risk of relying on TSMC's chip production for the global AI industry?\n    - A: TSMC's chip production is not reliable.\n    - B: TSMC's chip production is vulnerable to disruptions due to its location in Taiwan.\n    - C: TSMC's chip production is not scalable to meet the demands of the global AI industry.\n    - D: TSMC's chip production is too expensive.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) What is the significance of TSMC's Grand Alliance in the global semiconductor industry?\n    - A: It allows TSMC to dominate the market by controlling the supply chain.\n    - B: It enables TSMC to partner with other companies to develop new chip technologies.\n    - C: It creates a network effect that makes it difficult for other companies to compete with TSMC.\n    - D: It allows TSMC to reduce its production costs by outsourcing to other companies.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n14) What is the potential impact of the US government's efforts to reduce its reliance on chip fabrication facilities in East Asia on the global AI industry?\n    - A: It would lead to a significant increase in AI chip production in the US.\n    - B: It would reduce the risk of a global shortage of AI chips.\n    - C: It would promote the development of AI in China.\n    - D: It would have no impact on the global AI industry.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n15) What would be the potential consequence of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan on TSMC's chip production?\n    - A: TSMC's chip production would continue uninterrupted.\n    - B: TSMC's chip production would be disrupted, but the company would be able to recover quickly.\n    - C: TSMC's chip production would be severely disrupted, and the company might not be able to recover.\n    -
