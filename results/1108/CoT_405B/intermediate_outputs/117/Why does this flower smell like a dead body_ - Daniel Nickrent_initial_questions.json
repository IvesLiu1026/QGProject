    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n1) What is the name of the world's biggest and perhaps strangest flower?\n    - A: Rafflesia tetrastigma\n    - B: Rafflesia arnoldii\n    - C: Tetrastigma rafflesia\n    - D: Rafflesia gigantea\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary host plant that Rafflesia infects?\n    - A: A genus of large trees\n    - B: A genus of large vines related to the grape\n    - C: A genus of small shrubs\n    - D: A genus of succulent plants\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension**\n1) How do Rafflesia plants typically exist within their host?\n    - A: As epiphytes, growing on the surface of the host\n    - B: As endophytes, single thin strands of cells beneath the bark of the host\n    - C: As saprophytes, obtaining nutrients from dead organic matter\n    - D: As parasites, obtaining nutrients from the host's roots\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why is Rafflesia completely dependent on its host?\n    - A: Because it lacks the ability to photosynthesize\n    - B: Because it lacks the ability to absorb water and nutrients\n    - C: Because it lacks the ability to produce flowers\n    - D: Because it lacks the ability to produce seeds\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Application**\n1) What could understanding the unique characteristics of Rafflesia inform strategies for?\n    - A: Controlling invasive species\n    - B: Cultivating new crops\n    - C: Conservation and cultivation of this rare plant\n    - D: Developing new medicines\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What could the study of Rafflesia's parasitic relationship with its host provide insights into?\n    - A: The development of new methods for controlling invasive species\n    - B: The evolution of parasitic relationships in animals\n    - C: The development of new technologies for genetic engineering\n    - D: The conservation of endangered species\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the relationship between Rafflesia and its host Tetrastigma an example of?\n    - A: A symbiotic relationship, where both organisms benefit\n    - B: A parasitic relationship, where one organism benefits at the expense of the other\n    - C: A mutualistic relationship, where both organisms benefit equally\n    - D: A commensal relationship, where one organism benefits and the other is not affected\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What may be related to the loss of DNA in Rafflesia's plastids?\n    - A: Its ability to photosynthesize\n    - B: Its parasitic lifestyle\n    - C: Its ability to produce flowers\n    - D: Its ability to produce seeds\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) What may allow Rafflesia to evolve and adapt more quickly than other plants?\n    - A: Its ability to photosynthesize\n    - B: Its parasitic lifestyle and ability to steal genetic material through horizontal gene transfer\n    - C: Its ability to produce large flowers\n    - D: Its ability to produce many seeds\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What could the study of Rafflesia's unique characteristics provide insights into?\n    - A: The evolution of parasitic relationships in animals\n    - B: The evolution of parasitic relationships in plants\n    - C: The development of new technologies for genetic engineering\n    - D: The conservation of endangered species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) Why is the conservation of Rafflesia and its habitat crucial?\n    - A: Because it is a rare and endangered plant\n    - B: Because it has the potential to provide new medicines\n    - C: Because it is a unique and fascinating plant that provides insights into the evolution of parasitic relationships\n    - D: Because it is a keystone species in its ecosystem\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What highlights the need for further research into Rafflesia's life cycle and requirements?\n    - A: The ease of cultivating Rafflesia outside of its natural habitat\n    - B: The difficulty of cultivating Rafflesia outside of its natural habitat\n    - C: The abundance of Rafflesia in its natural habitat\n    - D: The lack of interest in Rafflesia among scientists\n[Correct answer]: B"
