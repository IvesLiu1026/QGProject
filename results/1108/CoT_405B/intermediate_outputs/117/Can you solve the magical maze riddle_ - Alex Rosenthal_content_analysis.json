In the Calchemy event, Newt-niz won, Leib-ton took second, and Magnificent Marigold's Magical Macademy came in third.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. The tournament administrator must determine the number of events and the scoring system.\n2. The competitors are confused about the outcome due to a forgetting curse cast by a dark wizard.\n3. The administrator must figure out the winner to avoid a repeat of the Great Wizarding War.\n4. The total scores can be used to narrow down the possible scoring systems.\n5. The sum of all points in the tournament must be a multiple of one event's total.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. The administrator can use the total scores to create a table of possible scoring systems.\n2. By analyzing the possible points earned in each event, the administrator can eliminate certain options.\n3. The administrator can use the process of elimination to determine the correct scoring system and the winner of the tournament.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The relationship between the total scores and the possible scoring systems can be used to narrow down the options.\n2. The administrator can analyze the possible points earned in each event to determine which options are feasible.\n3. The contrast between the scores of 22 and 9 can be used to determine the correct scoring system.\n4. The cause-and-effect connection between the forgetting curse and the confusion among the competitors can be used to understand the situation.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. By combining the information from the total scores and the possible scoring systems, the administrator can create a table of possibilities.\n2.
