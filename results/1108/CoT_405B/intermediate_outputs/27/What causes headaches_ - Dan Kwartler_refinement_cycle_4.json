What is a recommended step to alleviate their symptoms?\n    - A: Taking medication to reduce stress\n    - B: Identifying and avoiding potential triggers, such as stress, dehydration, or hormone changes\n    - C: Ignoring the headaches and hoping they go away\n    - D: Seeing a doctor for immediate treatment\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) A doctor is diagnosing a patient with a headache. What should they do to determine whether the headache is primary or secondary?\n    - A: Prescribe medication immediately\n    - B: Conduct a thorough medical history and physical examination to determine the underlying cause\n    - C: Refer the patient to a specialist\n    - D: Tell the patient to come back if the headache persists\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) How does the inflammation of the sinuses contribute to headache pain?\n    - A: The inflammation of the sinuses reduces pressure on cranial arteries and veins.\n    - B: The inflammation of the sinuses has no effect on cranial arteries and veins.\n    - C: The inflammation of the sinuses increases pressure on cranial arteries and veins, leading to headache pain.\n    - D: The inflammation of the sinuses causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined for clarity.\n\n8) What is the contrast between primary and secondary headaches in terms of their underlying causes?\n    - A: Primary headaches are caused by underlying diseases, while secondary headaches are not.\n    - B: Primary headaches are not symptomatic of an underlying disease, injury, or condition, while secondary headaches are.\n    - C: Primary headaches are more severe, while secondary headaches are milder.\n    - D: Primary headaches are more common, while secondary headaches are less common.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) Why is understanding the underlying causes of headaches crucial for developing effective treatments and therapies?\n    - A: Because headaches are a minor health issue\n    - B: Because headaches are a complex phenomenon that requires a comprehensive approach\n    - C: Because current treatments are already effective\n    - D: Because headaches are only caused by one factor\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What is the critique of the ancient Greek practice of trepanation as a treatment for headaches?\n    - A: It was an effective treatment that should still be used today.\n    - B: It was a harmless practice that had no negative consequences.\n    - C: It was a harmful and ineffective practice that should not be used today.\n    - D: It was a necessary practice that saved many lives.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) Why is further research into the causes and treatments of headaches justified?\n    - A: Because current treatments are already effective\n    - B: Because headaches are a minor health issue\n    - C: Because headaches have a significant impact on a person's quality of life and current treatments are not yet fully effective\n    - D: Because headaches are only caused by one factor\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed."
