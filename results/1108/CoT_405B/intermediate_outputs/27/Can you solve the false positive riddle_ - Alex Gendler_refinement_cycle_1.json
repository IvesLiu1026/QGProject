A: 0.1%\n    - B: 1%\n    - C: 10%\n    - D: 50%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the error rate of the unobtainium detector when detecting other minerals?\n    - A: 1%\n    - B: 5%\n    - C: 10%\n    - D: 20%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Given a positive detector reading, what is the probability that a rock contains unobtainium?\n    - A: 1%\n    - B: 9%\n    - C: 50%\n    - D: 100%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What term describes the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred?\n    - A: Prior probability\n    - B: Posterior probability\n    - C: Conditional probability\n    - D: Unconditional probability\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is a potential consequence of a false positive result in medical testing?\n    - A: The patient will be cured of the disease\n    - B: The patient will experience stress or unnecessary treatment\n    - C: The patient will be immune to the disease\n    - D: The patient will not be affected\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) When considering a business deal with a low probability of success, what should be done?\n    - A: Accept the deal without evaluating the potential costs and benefits\n    - B: Reject the deal without evaluating the potential costs and benefits\n    - C: Evaluate the potential costs and benefits before making a decision\n    - D: Pay a fixed amount for the deal without evaluating the potential costs and benefits\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How does the rarity of unobtainium in the mine affect the accuracy of the detector?\n    - A: The accuracy of the detector is not affected by the rarity of unobtainium\n    - B: The accuracy of the detector is directly proportional to the rarity of unobtainium\n    - C: The accuracy of the detector is inversely proportional to the rarity of unobtainium\n    - D: The accuracy of the detector is affected by the rarity of unobtainium, but not directly proportional\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the difference between prior probability and posterior probability?\n    - A: Prior probability is the probability of an event after additional information is given, while posterior probability is the probability of an event before any additional information is given\n    - B: Prior probability is the probability of an event before any additional information is given, while posterior probability is the probability of an event after additional information is given\n    - C: Prior probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred, while posterior probability is the probability of an event without considering any other events\n    - D: Prior probability is the probability of an event without considering any other events, while posterior probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can the base rate fallacy be avoided when evaluating the probability of a rock containing unobtainium given a positive detector reading?\n    - A: By ignoring the base rate of unobtainium and only considering the accuracy of the detector\n    - B: By considering the prior probability of unobtainium in the mine and the accuracy of the detector\n    - C: By assuming that the detector is 100% accurate and ignoring the prior probability of unobtainium\n    - D: By using the posterior probability of unobtainium given a positive detector reading as the prior probability\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the importance of considering prior probability when evaluating the accuracy of a test?\n    - A: It is irrelevant to the accuracy of the test\n    - B: It is directly proportional to the accuracy of the test\n    - C: It helps to avoid the base rate fallacy and ensures accurate evaluation\n    - D: It is only necessary when the test is 100% accurate\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) Is Tricky Joe's offer to sell the ore for $200 fair?\n    - A: Yes, because the probability of the ore containing unobtainium is 9%\n    - B: No, because the probability of the ore containing unobtainium is 9% and the potential costs and benefits should be evaluated\n    - C: Yes, because the detector is 100% accurate\n    - D: No, because the detector is not 100% accurate\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a potential critique of the design of the unobtainium detector?\n    - A: The detector is too accurate and should be made less accurate to reduce false positives\n    - B: The detector is not accurate enough and should be made more accurate to reduce false negatives\n    - C: The detector has a high false positive rate, which could lead to negative consequences\n    - D: The detector is perfect and should not be changed\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
