What could be a consequence of a false positive result?\n    - A: The patient will be cured of the disease\n    - B: The patient will experience stress or unnecessary treatment\n    - C: The patient will be immune to the disease\n    - D: The patient will not be affected\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A company is considering a business deal with a 9% chance of success. What should they do?\n    - A: Accept the deal without considering the potential costs and benefits\n    - B: Reject the deal without considering the potential costs and benefits\n    - C: Evaluate the potential costs and benefits before making a decision\n    - D: Pay $200 for the deal without considering the potential costs and benefits\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect connections)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the accuracy of the unobtainium detector and the rarity of unobtainium in the mine?\n    - A: The accuracy of the detector is not affected by the rarity of unobtainium\n    - B: The accuracy of the detector is directly proportional to the rarity of unobtainium\n    - C: The accuracy of the detector is inversely proportional to the rarity of unobtainium\n    - D: The accuracy of the detector is affected by the rarity of unobtainium, but not directly proportional\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is the contrast between prior probability and posterior probability?\n    - A: Prior probability is the probability of an event after additional information is given, while posterior probability is the probability of an event before any additional information is given\n    - B: Prior probability is the probability of an event before any additional information is given, while posterior probability is the probability of an event after additional information is given\n    - C: Prior probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred, while posterior probability is the probability of an event without considering any other events\n    - D: Prior probability is the probability of an event without considering any other events, while posterior probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas to form new understanding)**\n\n1) How can the concepts of conditional probability and the base rate fallacy be combined to evaluate the probability of a rock containing unobtainium given a positive detector reading?\n    - A: By ignoring the base rate fallacy and only considering the accuracy of the detector\n    - B: By considering the prior probability of unobtainium in the mine and the accuracy of the detector\n    - C: By assuming that the detector is 100% accurate and ignoring the prior probability of unobtainium\n    - D: By using the posterior probability of unobtainium given a positive detector reading as the prior probability\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How can the example of the unobtainium detector be used to illustrate the importance of considering prior probability when evaluating the accuracy of a test?\n    - A: By showing that the prior probability of unobtainium is irrelevant to the accuracy of the detector\n    - B: By demonstrating that the accuracy of the detector is directly proportional to the prior probability of unobtainium\n    - C: By highlighting the consequences of ignoring the prior probability of unobtainium when evaluating the accuracy of the detector\n    - D: By assuming that the detector is 100% accurate and ignoring the prior probability of unobtainium\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) Is Tricky Joe's offer to sell the ore for $200 fair?\n    - A: Yes, because the probability of the ore containing unobtainium is 9%\n    - B: No, because the probability of the ore containing unobtainium is 9% and the potential costs and benefits should be evaluated\n    - C: Yes, because the detector is 100% accurate\n    - D: No, because the detector is not 100% accurate\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a potential critique of the design of the unobtainium detector?\n    - A: The detector is too accurate and should be made less accurate to reduce false positives\n    - B: The detector is not accurate enough and should be made more accurate to reduce false negatives\n    - C: The detector has a high false positive rate, which could lead to negative consequences\n    - D: The detector is perfect and should not be changed\n[Correct answer]: C"
