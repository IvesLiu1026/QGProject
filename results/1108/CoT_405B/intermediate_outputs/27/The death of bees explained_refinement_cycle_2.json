    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the estimated annual dollar value of plants pollinated by honey bees?\n    - A: $100 billion\n    - B: $200 billion\n    - C: $265 billion\n    - D: $500 billion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the name of the chemical family similar to nicotine that was approved in the early 1990s as an alternative to chemicals like DDT?\n    - A: Organophosphates\n    - B: Neonicotinoids\n    - C: Pyrethroids\n    - D: Carbamates\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) According to a quote often attributed to Einstein, what could happen to humans if honey bees were to die out?\n    - A: Humans would experience food shortages\n    - B: Humans would follow a few years later\n    - C: Humans would experience economic losses\n    - D: Humans would experience environmental degradation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How do parasites like Acarapis woodi and Varroa destructor affect honey bee colonies?\n    - A: They strengthen the immune system of honey bees\n    - B: They have no impact on honey bee colonies\n    - C: They weaken honey bee colonies by feeding on bees and spreading diseases\n    - D: They compete with honey bees for food\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is a potential consequence of using neonicotinoids on crops?\n    - A: Increased honey bee populations\n    - B: Decreased honey bee populations due to toxicity\n    - C: No impact on honey bee populations\n    - D: Increased crop yields\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is an example of an individual action that can help protect honey bee populations?\n    - A: Using more pesticides\n    - B: Supporting local beekeepers and reducing pesticide use\n    - C: Planting fewer flowers\n    - D: Reducing biodiversity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the decline of honey bees and the potential consequences for human food systems?\n    - A: The decline of honey bees will have no impact on human food systems\n    - B: The decline of honey bees will lead to an increase in food production\n    - C: The decline of honey bees will lead to a decrease in food production and diversity\n    - D: The decline of honey bees will lead to a change in food preferences\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How do industry-sponsored studies on the toxicity of neonicotinoids to honey bees compare to independent research?\n    - A: Industry-sponsored studies are more reliable\n    - B: Independent research is more reliable\n    - C: Both are equally reliable\n    - D: There is no comparison\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a comprehensive approach to protecting honey bee populations?\n    - A: Using more pesticides\n    - B: Changing agricultural practices, reducing pesticide use, and supporting local beekeepers\n    - C: Planting more flowers\n    - D: Supporting local beekeepers only\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) How can individual actions contribute to a larger solution to protect honey bee populations?\n    - A: By using more pesticides\n    - B: By supporting local beekeepers, reducing pesticide use, and promoting sustainable agriculture\n    - C: By planting fewer flowers\n    - D: By reducing biodiversity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a critique of industry-sponsored studies on the toxicity of neonicotinoids to honey bees?\n    - A: They are too expensive\n    - B: They are biased towards the industry's interests\n    - C: They are too time-consuming\n    - D: They are too complicated\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a justification for finding alternative pesticides that are safer for honey bees?\n    - A: To reduce costs\n    - B: To increase yields\n    - C: To protect human health, the environment, and honey bee populations\n    - D: To increase profits\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12. However, I suggest considering adding more questions to cover other key concepts in the transcript, such as the impact of colony collapse disorder, the role of viruses and fungi in honey bee decline, and the importance of genetic diversity in honey bee populations."
