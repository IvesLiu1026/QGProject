    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the approximate age of the oldest known glue found in a cave near the Dead Sea?\n    - A: 5,000 years old\n    - B: 8,000 years old\n    - C: 10,000 years old\n    - D: 12,000 years old\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What type of molecules or materials can adhesives be made from?\n    - A: Only synthetic molecules\n    - B: Only natural proteins and carbohydrates\n    - C: Synthetic molecules or natural proteins and carbohydrates\n    - D: Neither synthetic molecules nor natural proteins and carbohydrates\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What type of bonds does an adhesive require to be effective?\n    - A: Only adhesive bonds\n    - B: Only cohesive bonds\n    - C: Both adhesive bonds and cohesive bonds\n    - D: Neither adhesive bonds nor cohesive bonds\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What determines the stickiness of tape?\n    - A: Only the proportion of elastic component and tackifier\n    - B: Only the adhesive thickness\n    - C: Only the backing material\n    - D: The proportion of elastic component and tackifier, adhesive thickness, and backing material\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What type of glue would be suitable for an application that requires withstanding high heat?\n    - A: Cyanoacrylate (super glue)\n    - B: Two-component epoxy glue\n    - C: Dextrin-based adhesive\n    - D: Casein-based adhesive\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) In what situation would duct tape be a suitable choice for repairs?\n    - A: In situations where long-term durability is necessary\n    - B: In situations where instantaneous stickiness is necessary\n    - C: In situations where high heat resistance is necessary\n    - D: In situations where water resistance is necessary\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between adhesive bonds, cohesive bonds, and the drying process?\n    - A: The drying process weakens adhesive bonds and strengthens cohesive bonds\n    - B: The drying process strengthens adhesive bonds and weakens cohesive bonds\n    - C: The drying process makes both adhesive bonds and cohesive bonds irreversible\n    - D: The drying process has no effect on adhesive bonds and cohesive bonds\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the main difference between the properties of cyanoacrylates and epoxy glues?\n    - A: Cyanoacrylates are stronger, while epoxy glues are more flexible\n    - B: Cyanoacrylates are more flexible, while epoxy glues are stronger in terms of heat and shearing resistance\n    - C: Cyanoacrylates are more suitable for high-heat applications, while epoxy glues are more suitable for low-heat applications\n    - D: Cyanoacrylates are more suitable for low-heat applications, while epoxy glues are more suitable for high-heat applications\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What could be a potential benefit of developing a new adhesive that combines the strengths of different materials?\n    - A: Improved cost-effectiveness\n    - B: Enhanced environmental sustainability\n    - C: Increased versatility and adaptability\n    - D: Reduced production time\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a key consideration when selecting an adhesive for use in extreme environments, such as space?\n    - A: Cost\n    - B: Strength\n    - C: Ability to function in zero gravity\n    - D: Aesthetics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a potential application of adhesives in the aerospace industry?\n    - A: Developing new types of fuel\n    - B: Creating more efficient propulsion systems\n    - C: Designing lightweight and durable materials for aircraft construction\n    - D: Improving navigation systems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What factor should be considered when assessing the suitability of a particular adhesive for a specific task or environment?\n    - A: Only the adhesive's strength\n    - B: Only the adhesive's cost\n    - C: Only the adhesive's environmental impact\n    - D: A combination of factors, including strength, cost, and environmental impact\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n13) What trade-off might be necessary when selecting an adhesive for a particular application?\n    - A: Strength vs. flexibility\n    - B: Cost vs. environmental impact\n    - C: Durability vs. ease of use\n    - D: Aesthetics vs. functionality\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 14-16 as they were duplicates of earlier questions. I also refined question 10 to make it more specific and relevant to the transcript. No further refinement is necessary for the remaining questions."
