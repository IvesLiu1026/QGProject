    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary purpose of scientific classification, or taxonomy, in organizing living things?\n    - A: To study the evolution of species\n    - B: To identify the diet and habitat of organisms\n    - C: To group organisms based on their characteristics\n    - D: To predict the behavior of organisms\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which of the following is NOT one of the five common types of mouthparts found in insects?\n    - A: Chewing\n    - B: Siphoning\n    - C: Sponging\n    - D: Filtering\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What can the type of mouthpart an insect has provide clues about?\n    - A: Its habitat and migration patterns\n    - B: Its evolution and diet\n    - C: Its social behavior and communication\n    - D: Its body structure and development\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Which type of mouthpart is used to suck up nectar from flowers?\n    - A: Chewing\n    - B: Piercing-sucking\n    - C: Siphoning\n    - D: Sponging\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A scientist is trying to categorize an insect found in the wild. What characteristic can they use to help with identification?\n    - A: Wing coloration\n    - B: Body shape\n    - C: Mouthpart type\n    - D: Leg structure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) A farmer is trying to control a pest population that is damaging their crops. What information can help inform their strategies?\n    - A: The pest's migration patterns\n    - B: The pest's social behavior\n    - C: The pest's mouthpart type and diet\n    - D: The pest's predator-prey relationships\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the type of mouthpart and the insect's diet and evolution?\n    - A: The type of mouthpart determines the insect's diet and evolution\n    - B: The type of mouthpart is influenced by the insect's diet and evolution\n    - C: The type of mouthpart is unrelated to the insect's diet and evolution\n    - D: The type of mouthpart is only related to the insect's diet\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) Which two types of mouthparts are similar in that they both involve the use of enzymes to break down food?\n    - A: Chewing and piercing-sucking\n    - B: Siphoning and sponging\n    - C: Piercing-sucking and sponging\n    - D: Chewing and siphoning\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can the combination of mouthpart type and other characteristics be used?\n    - A: To identify an insect's order and family\n    - B: To predict an insect's behavior and diet\n    - C: To inform strategies for controlling pest populations\n    - D: To study the evolution of insect species\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What may have influenced the diversification of insect species?\n    - A: The evolution of wings\n    - B: The evolution of mouthparts\n    - C: The evolution of social behavior\n    - D: The evolution of predator-prey relationships\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a limitation of using mouthpart type as the sole characteristic for identifying an insect's order and family?\n    - A: It is too time-consuming\n    - B: It is too expensive\n    - C: It may not be accurate for all insects, especially in different life stages\n    - D: It is too complex\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is it important to understand the different types of mouthparts in the context of insect ecology and evolution?\n    - A: Because it can help us better understand the evolution of insect species\n    - B: Because it can help us develop new strategies for controlling pest populations\n    - C: Because it can help us predict an insect's behavior and diet\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo major changes were necessary, but minor adjustments were made to improve clarity and concision. The questions now accurately reflect the key concepts in the transcript and have plausible but incorrect distractors."
