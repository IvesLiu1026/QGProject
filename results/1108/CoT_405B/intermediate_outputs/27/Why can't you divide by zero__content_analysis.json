    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge** (Specific facts or details that can be recalled directly):\n\n1. Dividing by smaller numbers gives bigger answers.\n2. The multiplicative inverse of a number x is a number that, when multiplied by x, gives 1.\n3. The product of any number and its multiplicative inverse is always 1.\n4. Zero has no multiplicative inverse.\n5. Anything multiplied by zero is still zero.\n6. The square root of negative one is defined as a new number called i.\n7. The Riemann sphere involves dividing by zero by a different method.\n\n**Comprehension** (Important concepts that require understanding or interpretation):\n\n1. Division is essentially the reverse of multiplication.\n2. The concept of a multiplicative inverse is crucial in understanding division.\n3. The idea of dividing by zero is problematic because it would require a multiplicative inverse that does not exist.\n4. Mathematicians have broken rules before, such as defining the square root of negative numbers.\n5. The concept of infinity is not necessarily equal to one over zero.\n\n**Application** (Scenarios or real-world applications where the content can be applied):\n\n1.
