    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the U.S. dollar bill is made of cotton?\n    - A: 50%\n    - B: 60%\n    - C: 75%\n    - D: 90%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the ideal length that a cotton fiber can grow in ideal conditions?\n    - A: Up to 2 centimeters\n    - B: Up to 3.6 centimeters\n    - C: Up to 5 centimeters\n    - D: Up to 10 centimeters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What determines the durability of the final product made from cotton fibers?\n    - A: The length of the fiber\n    - B: The density of the primary cell wall\n    - C: The density of the secondary cell wall\n    - D: The softness of the fiber\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What property of cotton fibers is influenced by their length?\n    - A: Strength\n    - B: Flexibility\n    - C: Softness\n    - D: Durability\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) Which ancient civilization developed suits of armor made from cotton?\n    - A: Aztecs\n    - B: Mayans\n    - C: Incas\n    - D: Greeks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential benefit of modern science optimizing cotton growth?\n    - A: Increased cost of production\n    - B: Decreased quality of fibers\n    - C: Softer, stronger, and more resilient fibers\n    - D: Reduced versatility of cotton\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How do the length and fineness of cotton fibers affect the strength and quality of the resulting fabric?\n    - A: Longer and coarser fibers produce stronger fabric\n    - B: Shorter and finer fibers produce weaker fabric\n    - C: Longer and finer fibers produce stronger and higher-quality fabric\n    - D: Shorter and coarser fibers produce stronger and higher-quality fabric\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the relationship between the density of the secondary cell wall and the durability of the final product?\n    - A: Higher density leads to lower durability\n    - B: Lower density leads to higher durability\n    - C: Higher density leads to higher durability\n    - D: Density has no impact on durability\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What makes cotton fibers suitable for a wide range of applications?\n    - A: Their high cost and limited availability\n    - B: Their unique combination of strength, flexibility, and softness\n    - C: Their durability and resistance to water\n    - D: Their limited versatility and suitability for textiles only\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What could be a potential outcome of optimizing cotton growth through modern science?\n    - A: The development of new products with unique properties\n    - B: The reduction of cotton's suitability for different applications\n    - C: The increase in cotton's environmental impact\n    - D: The decrease in cotton's economic viability\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential benefit of using cotton in innovative and sustainable ways?\n    - A: Reduced environmental impact and increased economic viability\n    - B: Increased environmental impact and reduced economic viability\n    - C: No impact on the environment or economy\n    - D: Reduced suitability for different applications\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is a potential trade-off when optimizing cotton growth for strength and softness?\n    - A: Increased durability and reduced environmental impact\n    - B: Reduced durability and increased environmental impact\n    - C: Increased strength and reduced softness\n    - D: Reduced strength and increased softness\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefinements were made to enhance clarity and conciseness, confirm distractors are plausible but incorrect, and ensure correct answers are accurate. No more significant refinements are needed at this time."
