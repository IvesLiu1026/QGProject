Each cotton fiber is made of just one cell with multiple layers of cell wall.\n4. The primary cell wall stiffens after a few days, causing the fiber to elongate.\n5. Cellulose makes up 34% of the cell wall during the strengthening stage.\n6. The ideal length of a cotton fiber is up to 3.6 centimeters with a 25 micrometer width.\n7. The U.S. dollar bill is 75% cotton.\n8. Cellulose makes up over 90% of the fiber's weight in the secondary cell wall.\n9. The density of the secondary cell wall determines the strength of the final fiber.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The unique properties of cotton fibers, such as strength, flexibility, softness, and durability, are due to their intricate biology.\n2. The growth of cotton fibers involves multiple stages, including elongation, strengthening, and thickening of the cell wall.\n3. The length and fineness of cotton fibers affect the strength and quality of the resulting fabric.\n4. The density of the secondary cell wall determines the durability of the final product, such as a t-shirt.\n5. The softness of cotton is influenced by the length of the fiber.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. The use of cotton in various products, such as textiles, coffee filters, diapers, and fishing nets.\n2. The development of suits of armor made from cotton by the Inca.\n3. The potential for modern science to optimize cotton growth for softer, stronger, and more resilient fibers.\n4. The importance of ideal growing conditions, including temperature, water, fertilizer, pest control, and light, for cotton fibers.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and connections)**\n\n1. The relationship between the length and fineness of cotton fibers and the strength and quality of the resulting fabric.\n2. The connection between the density of the secondary cell wall and the durability of the final product.\n3. The trade-off between the strength and softness of cotton fibers, depending on the timing of cell wall strengthening.\n4. The comparison between the properties of cotton fibers and their suitability for different applications.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. The combination of strength, flexibility, and softness in cotton fibers makes them suitable for a wide range of applications.\n2. The optimization of cotton growth through modern science could lead to the development of new products with unique properties.\n3. The understanding of the biology of cotton fibers can inform the design of new materials with similar properties.\n4. The potential for cotton to be used in innovative ways, such as in the development of sustainable and durable materials.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n1. The evaluation of the effectiveness of cotton fibers in different applications, such as textiles or armor.\n2. The assessment of the impact of modern science on the optimization of cotton growth and its potential benefits.\n3. The critique of the trade-offs between strength, softness, and durability in cotton fibers and their implications for different products.\n4. The judgment of the potential for cotton to be used in innovative and sustainable ways."
