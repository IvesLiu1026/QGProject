Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) As of 2021, how many species of vipers are there worldwide?\n    - A: 200\n    - B: 368\n    - C: 500\n    - D: 1000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary material that makes up the rattle of a rattlesnake?\n    - A: Bone\n    - B: Keratin\n    - C: Scale\n    - D: Skin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is a unique characteristic of vipers that sets them apart from most other snakes?\n    - A: They have a rattle on their tail\n    - B: They have heat-sensing pits\n    - C: They give birth to live young\n    - D: They have a venomous bite\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the primary function of the bushmaster's heat-sensing pits?\n    - A: To detect vibrations in the air\n    - B: To see the heat signature of approaching prey or predators\n    - C: To regulate its body temperature\n    - D: To communicate with other snakes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a notable adaptation of the spider-tailed horned viper?\n    - A: Its large size\n    - B: Its ability to change color\n    - C: Its unique bulbous tail-tip that resembles a spider\n    - D: Its highly venomous fangs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential benefit of studying the adaptations of vipers?\n    - A: Developing new technologies for snakebite treatments\n    - B: Understanding the behavior of other snake species\n    - C: Improving conservation efforts for vipers\n    - D: Reducing the population of vipers in the wild\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How do vipers use their hollow fangs?\n    - A: To defend against predators\n    - B: To deliver venom to their prey\n    - C: To regulate their body temperature\n    - D: To communicate with other snakes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What does the spider-tailed horned viper's unique tail-tip demonstrate about its hunting strategy?\n    - A: The importance of camouflage in hunting\n    - B: The effectiveness of using speed to catch prey\n    - C: The adaptability of vipers in using decoys to lure prey\n    - D: The role of heat-sensing pits in hunting\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be gained by studying the unique characteristics and adaptations of vipers?\n    - A: A greater understanding of the behavior of other snake species\n    - B: A more comprehensive understanding of vipers\n    - C: A better understanding of the importance of conservation efforts\n    - D: A greater appreciation for the venom of vipers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can be achieved by comparing and contrasting the different species of vipers?\n    - A: Identifying patterns and trends in their adaptations and behaviors\n    - B: Understanding the behavior of other snake species\n    - C: Improving conservation efforts for vipers\n    - D: Reducing the population of vipers in the wild\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
