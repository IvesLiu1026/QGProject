    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What unique feature related to cockroaches is found in the Egyptian Book of the Dead?\n    - A: A spell for summoning cockroaches\n    - B: A banishment spell against mosquitoes\n    - C: A banishment spell against cockroaches\n    - D: A spell for protecting against radiation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Approximately how many cockroach species exist?\n    - A: 1,000\n    - B: 3,000\n    - C: 5,000\n    - D: 10,000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What contributes to the resilience of cockroaches?\n    - A: Their ability to fly\n    - B: A combination of physical and chemical adaptations\n    - C: Their slow reproductive rate\n    - D: Their limited diet\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What important ecological role do most cockroach species play?\n    - A: Pollination of plants\n    - B: Recycling dead or decaying organic matter\n    - C: Regulating populations of other animals\n    - D: Dispersing seeds\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can understanding cockroach behavior and adaptations help with?\n    - A: Developing effective conservation methods\n    - B: Developing effective pest control methods\n    - C: Studying the immune system of humans\n    - D: Analyzing the evolution of pesticide resistance in other animals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can recognizing the importance of cockroaches in ecosystems inform?\n    - A: Strategies for sustainable agriculture\n    - B: Conservation efforts\n    - C: Methods for controlling invasive species\n    - D: Techniques for studying animal behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is a cause-and-effect connection related to cockroach populations?\n    - A: The use of pesticides and the decline of cockroach populations\n    - B: The use of pesticides and the evolution of resistance in cockroach populations\n    - C: The increase in cockroach populations and the decrease in pesticide use\n    - D: The decrease in cockroach populations and the increase in pesticide use\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a contrast related to cockroach species?\n    - A: The similarity in ecological importance between most cockroach species and the pest status of a few species\n    - B: The difference in physical adaptations between German and American cockroaches\n    - C: The contrast between the ecological importance of most cockroach species and the pest status of a few species\n    - D: The similarity in immune systems between cockroaches and humans\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be developed by integrating knowledge of cockroach behavior, ecology, and evolution?\n    - A: A comprehensive understanding of their resilience\n    - B: A strategy for sustainable pest control\n    - C: A method for controlling invasive species\n    - D: A technique for studying animal behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can be informed by combining insights from the study of cockroach immune systems and pesticide resistance?\n    - A: Strategies for sustainable agriculture\n    - B: Methods for controlling invasive species\n    - C: Techniques for studying animal behavior\n    - D: Strategies for sustainable pest control\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of different pest control methods?\n    - A: Only the cost of the methods\n    - B: Only the environmental impact of the methods\n    - C: The adaptations and behavior of cockroaches\n    - D: Only the short-term results of the methods\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential consequence of the overuse of pesticides?\n    - A: The decline of cockroach populations\n    - B: The evolution of resistance in cockroach populations\n    - C: The increase in biodiversity\n    - D: The decrease in pesticide use\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) How do cockroaches typically respond to old-fashioned removal methods?\n    - A: They are easily caught and removed\n    - B: They are unaffected by the methods\n    - C: They rapidly detect and evade the methods\n    - D: They are attracted to the methods\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n14) What allows cockroaches to thrive in nutrient-poor environments?\n    - A: Their ability to store nitrogen-containing wastes\n    - B: Their ability to recycle nitrogen into useful molecules\n    - C: Their ability to eat a wide variety of organic matter\n    - D: Both A and B\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n15) Why are cockroaches able to withstand compressive forces of up to 900 times their own weight?\n    - A: Due to their rigid exoskeleton\n    - B: Due to their ability to distribute the impact along their body\n    - C: Due to their small size\n    - D: Due to their slow movement\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-12. Questions 13-15 were added to cover additional key concepts in the transcript."
