    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is a unique feature of the Egyptian Book of the Dead related to cockroaches?\n    - A: A spell for summoning cockroaches\n    - B: A banishment spell against mosquitoes\n    - C: A banishment spell against cockroaches\n    - D: A spell for protecting against radiation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Approximately how many cockroach species exist?\n    - A: 1,000\n    - B: 3,000\n    - C: 5,000\n    - D: 10,000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What contributes to the resilience of cockroaches?\n    - A: Their ability to fly\n    - B: A combination of physical and chemical adaptations\n    - C: Their slow reproductive rate\n    - D: Their limited diet\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is an important ecological role played by most cockroach species?\n    - A: Pollination of plants\n    - B: Recycling dead or decaying organic matter\n    - C: Regulating populations of other animals\n    - D: Dispersing seeds\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can understanding cockroach behavior and adaptations help with?\n    - A: Developing effective conservation methods\n    - B: Developing effective pest control methods\n    - C: Studying the immune system of humans\n    - D: Analyzing the evolution of pesticide resistance in other animals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can recognizing the importance of cockroaches in ecosystems inform?\n    - A: Strategies for sustainable agriculture\n    - B: Conservation efforts\n    - C: Methods for controlling invasive species\n    - D: Techniques for studying animal behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is a cause-and-effect connection related to cockroach populations?\n    - A: The use of pesticides and the decline of cockroach populations\n    - B: The use of pesticides and the evolution of resistance in cockroach populations\n    - C: The increase in cockroach populations and the decrease in pesticide use\n    - D: The decrease in cockroach populations and the increase in pesticide use\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a contrast related to cockroach species?\n    - A: The similarity in ecological importance between most cockroach species and the pest status of a few species\n    - B: The difference in physical adaptations between German and American cockroaches\n    - C: The contrast between the ecological importance of most cockroach species and the pest status of a few species\n    - D: The similarity in immune systems between cockroaches and humans\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be developed by integrating knowledge of cockroach behavior, ecology, and evolution?\n    - A: A comprehensive understanding of their resilience\n    - B: A strategy for sustainable pest control\n    - C: A method for controlling invasive species\n    - D: A technique for studying animal behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can be informed by combining insights from the study of cockroach immune systems and pesticide resistance?\n    - A: Strategies for sustainable agriculture\n    - B: Methods for controlling invasive species\n    - C: Techniques for studying animal behavior\n    - D: Strategies for sustainable pest control\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of different pest control methods?\n    - A: Only the cost of the methods\n    - B: Only the environmental impact of the methods\n    - C: The adaptations and behavior of cockroaches\n    - D: Only the short-term results of the methods\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential consequence of the overuse of pesticides?\n    - A: The decline of cockroach populations\n    - B: The evolution of resistance in cockroach populations\n    - C: The increase in biodiversity\n    - D: The decrease in pesticide use\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo significant changes were made to the questions, as they already aligned with the key concepts in the transcript and had plausible but incorrect distractors. However, some minor adjustments were made to improve clarity and concision."
