What can they do to minimize the risk of being attacked?\n    - A: Wear bright colors to scare them away\n    - B: Make loud noises to startle them\n    - C: Move calmly and avoid sudden movements\n    - D: Feed them to gain their trust\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) A zookeeper is designing a new enclosure for a group of red-bellied piranhas. What should they consider when creating the environment?\n    - A: Providing a large amount of space for individual piranhas\n    - B: Creating a complex communication system for the piranhas\n    - C: Incorporating plants and other hiding places for the piranhas\n    - D: Maintaining a constant water temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1) A study found that piranhas in smaller groups had faster breathing rates than those in larger groups. What can be inferred from this data?\n    - A: Piranhas in smaller groups are more aggressive\n    - B: Piranhas in smaller groups are more anxious\n    - C: Piranhas in smaller groups are more relaxed\n    - D: Piranhas in smaller groups are more hungry\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the likely cause of aggressive behavior in piranhas?\n    - A: Overcrowding\n    - B: Starvation stress\n    - C: Changes in water temperature\n    - D: Presence of predators\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1) A researcher is developing a new strategy for interacting with piranhas in the wild. What should they consider combining to create an effective approach?\n    - A: Knowledge of piranha behavior and communication\n    - B: Understanding of piranha social behavior and ecology\n    - C: Insights from piranha communication and animal behavior\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) A conservationist is working to promote a more accurate public perception of piranhas. What should they consider integrating to achieve this goal?\n    - A: Information about piranha behavior and ecology\n    - B: Insights from piranha communication and social behavior\n    - C: Data on piranha population sizes and habitats\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1) Theodore Roosevelt's account of piranha behavior has been widely criticized for its inaccuracies. What can be said about the validity of his account?\n    - A: It is entirely accurate and reliable\n    - B: It is partially accurate but contains some exaggerations\n    - C: It is largely inaccurate and misleading\n    - D: It is impossible to determine its validity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) A documentary portrays piranhas as aggressive and bloodthirsty. What can be said about the portrayal?\n    - A: It is accurate and reflects the true nature of piranhas\n    - B: It is partially accurate but contains some exaggerations\n    - C: It is largely inaccurate and perpetuates negative stereotypes\n    - D: It is impossible to determine its accuracy\n[Correct answer]: C"
