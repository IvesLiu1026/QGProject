    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level based on the provided content analysis:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) Who conducted experiments on dogs in the 1890s to demonstrate classical conditioning?\n    - A: Ivan Pavlov\n    - B: B.F. Skinner\n    - C: Sigmund Freud\n    - D: Albert Bandura\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What are the two main components of operant conditioning?\n    - A: Reinforcement and punishment\n    - B: Classical and operant conditioning\n    - C: Positive and negative reinforcement\n    - D: Learning and behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What is the definition of learning in psychology?\n    - A: A short-term change in behavior based on experience\n    - B: A long-term change in behavior based on experience\n    - C: A change in behavior based on genetics\n    - D: A change in behavior based on environment\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the main difference between reinforcement and punishment in operant conditioning?\n    - A: Reinforcement decreases behavior, while punishment increases it\n    - B: Reinforcement increases behavior, while punishment decreases it\n    - C: Reinforcement has no effect on behavior, while punishment decreases it\n    - D: Reinforcement increases behavior, while punishment has no effect\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) A teacher wants to encourage students to complete their homework on time. Which type of conditioning would be most effective in this scenario?\n    - A: Classical conditioning\n    - B: Operant conditioning\n    - C: Social learning theory\n    - D: Cognitive theory\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) An advertiser wants to associate a new product with a positive stimulus to increase sales. Which type of conditioning would be most effective in this scenario?\n    - A: Classical conditioning\n    - B: Operant conditioning\n    - C: Social learning theory\n    - D: Cognitive theory\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the main difference between classical conditioning and operant conditioning?\n    - A: Classical conditioning involves associating a neutral stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus, while operant conditioning involves consequences leading to changes in voluntary behavior\n    - B: Classical conditioning involves consequences leading to changes in voluntary behavior, while operant conditioning involves associating a neutral stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus\n    - C: Classical conditioning involves positive reinforcement, while operant conditioning involves negative reinforcement\n    - D: Classical conditioning involves punishment, while operant conditioning involves reinforcement\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the relationship between reinforcement and behavior in operant conditioning?\n    - A: Reinforcement decreases behavior\n    - B: Reinforcement has no effect on behavior\n    - C: Reinforcement increases behavior\n    - D: Reinforcement decreases behavior in some cases and increases it in others\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How can classical conditioning and operant conditioning be combined to explain the development of phobias?\n    - A: Classical conditioning can explain the initial development of a phobia, while operant conditioning can explain the maintenance of the phobia through reinforcement\n    - B: Operant conditioning can explain the initial development of a phobia, while classical conditioning can explain the maintenance of the phobia through association\n    - C: Classical conditioning and operant conditioning are mutually exclusive and cannot be combined to explain phobias\n    - D: Classical conditioning can explain the development of phobias, but operant conditioning is not relevant\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) How can operant conditioning be combined with social learning theory to explain the development of complex behaviors?\n    - A: Operant conditioning can explain the reinforcement of behaviors, while social learning theory can explain the observation and imitation of behaviors\n    - B: Social learning theory can explain the reinforcement of behaviors, while operant conditioning can explain the observation and imitation of behaviors\n    - C: Operant conditioning and social learning theory are mutually exclusive and cannot be combined to explain complex behaviors\n    - D: Operant conditioning can explain the development of complex behaviors, but social learning theory is not relevant\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) What is a potential criticism of using operant conditioning in education?\n    - A: It is too effective and can lead to over-reliance on reinforcement\n    - B: It is not effective and can lead to decreased motivation\n    - C: It can lead to an overemphasis on extrinsic rewards and undermine intrinsic motivation\n    - D: It is only effective for simple behaviors and not complex ones\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a potential justification for using classical conditioning in advertising?\n    - A: It is a manipulative tactic that takes advantage of consumers\n    - B: It is a effective way to associate a product with a positive stimulus and increase sales\n    - C: It is a way to educate consumers about the benefits of a product\n    - D: It is a way to create a sense of community among consumers\n[Correct answer]: B"
