What is the purpose of using a Punnett square in genetics?\n    - A: To predict the probability of different genotypes and phenotypes in offspring\n    - B: To identify dominant and recessive traits\n    - C: To determine the genotype of a parent\n    - D: To explain the concept of mutation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. A couple wants to know the probability of their child inheriting a certain genetic disease. What tool can be used to visualize and predict the allele distribution?\n    - A: Pedigree chart\n    - B: Punnett square\n    - C: DNA sequencing\n    - D: Genetic testing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. A farmer wants to breed pea plants with a specific trait. What principle can be applied to predict the likelihood of the trait being expressed in the offspring?\n    - A: Mendel's principle of segregation\n    - B: Mendel's principle of independent assortment\n    - C: The concept of dominant and recessive traits\n    - D: The concept of genetic drift\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. What is the relationship between genotype and phenotype in determining expressed traits?\n    - A: Genotype determines phenotype, but phenotype does not affect genotype\n    - B: Phenotype determines genotype, but genotype does not affect phenotype\n    - C: Genotype and phenotype are independent of each other\n    - D: Genotype and phenotype are interchangeable terms\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2. What is the contrast between dominant and recessive traits in pea plants?\n    - A: Dominant traits are always expressed, while recessive traits are always hidden\n    - B: Dominant traits are always hidden, while recessive traits are always expressed\n    - C: Dominant traits are expressed when paired with a recessive trait, but recessive traits are expressed when paired with another recessive trait\n    - D: Dominant traits are expressed when paired with another dominant trait, but recessive traits are expressed when paired with a dominant trait\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. How can Mendel's principles be integrated with modern genetic knowledge to understand complex inheritance patterns?\n    - A: By using Punnett squares to predict trait inheritance\n    - B: By applying the concept of dominant and recessive traits to real-world scenarios\n    - C: By combining Mendel's principles with molecular genetics and epigenetics\n    - D: By using genetic testing to determine an individual's genotype\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What is the limitation of Mendel's model in explaining all aspects of inheritance?\n    - A: It does not account for genetic drift\n    - B: It does not account for mutation\n    - C: It does not account for complex interactions between multiple genes\n    - D: It does not account for environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1.
