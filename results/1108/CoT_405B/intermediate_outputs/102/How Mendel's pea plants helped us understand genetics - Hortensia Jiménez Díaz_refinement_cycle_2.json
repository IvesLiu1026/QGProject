    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What did Gregor Mendel discover through his experiments with pea plants in the monastery's garden?\n    - A: The structure of DNA\n    - B: The process of photosynthesis\n    - C: The principles that rule heredity\n    - D: The function of genes in disease\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What term did Mendel use to describe the trait that was expressed in all the new seeds, masking the other trait?\n    - A: Recessive\n    - B: Dominant\n    - C: Genotype\n    - D: Phenotype\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What term refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, consisting of a pair of alleles?\n    - A: Genotype\n    - B: Phenotype\n    - C: Dominant\n    - D: Recessive\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What diagram is used to visualize the distribution of alleles amongst descendants and predict the probability of certain traits?\n    - A: Punnett square\n    - B: Genetic map\n    - C: DNA sequence\n    - D: Pedigree chart\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) In Mendel's pea experiment, what is the expected proportion of phenotypes in the second generation, where the two heterozygous parents produce offspring?\n    - A: 1:1\n    - B: 2:1\n    - C: 3:1\n    - D: 4:1\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What term describes an organism that has two identical alleles for a particular trait, such as YY or yy?\n    - A: Heterozygous\n    - B: Homozygous\n    - C: Dominant\n    - D: Recessive\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What term describes an organism that has two different alleles for a particular trait, such as Yy?\n    - A: Heterozygous\n    - B: Homozygous\n    - C: Dominant\n    - D: Recessive\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
