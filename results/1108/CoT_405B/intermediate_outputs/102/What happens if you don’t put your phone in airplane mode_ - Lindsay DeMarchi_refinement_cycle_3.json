    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of electromagnetic waves do cell phones use to connect to networks and transmit information?\n    - A: Visible light waves\n    - B: Radio waves\n    - C: Microwaves\n    - D: Infrared waves\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why do cell phones expend more battery power when they are far from a cell tower?\n    - A: To reduce interference with other signals\n    - B: To increase the amplitude of the signal and make a connection\n    - C: To switch to a different wavelength\n    - D: To maintain a stable connection speed\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary purpose of assigning a specific wavelength to each phone involved in a call?\n    - A: To increase the signal strength\n    - B: To reduce interference with other signals\n    - C: To prioritize certain calls\n    - D: To optimize network traffic\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is a major source of interference with cell tower signals?\n    - A: Phones on airplane mode\n    - B: Phones searching for signals from high altitudes, such as on an airplane\n    - C: Satellite transmissions in adjacent frequency bands\n    - D: Radio telescopes operating in protected frequency bands\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is the potential consequence of not using airplane mode on a plane?\n    - A: Interfering with the plane's navigation system\n    - B: Disrupting the cell tower signals on the ground\n    - C: Increasing the risk of a plane crash\n    - D: Reducing the phone's battery life due to increased signal strength\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the impact of rogue radio waves emitted by electronics on internet and call quality?\n    - A: They improve the internet speed and call quality\n    - B: They have no effect on internet and call quality\n    - C: They slow down the internet and make calls choppy\n    - D: They increase the risk of data breaches due to signal overlap\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) Why is it challenging for radio telescopes to detect signals from deep space?\n    - A: Because of the limited range of wavelengths they can detect\n    - B: Because of the interference from human-made radio signals, such as satellite transmissions and phone signals\n    - C: Because of the lack of funding for radio telescopes\n    - D: Because of the limited number of radio telescopes available in optimal locations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the benefit of having radio-quiet areas on Earth?\n    - A: They improve the cell phone signal strength and reduce dropped calls\n    - B: They reduce the interference with satellite transmissions in adjacent frequency bands\n    - C: They allow radio telescopes to detect signals from deep space with minimal interference\n    - D: They increase the internet speed by reducing network congestion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
