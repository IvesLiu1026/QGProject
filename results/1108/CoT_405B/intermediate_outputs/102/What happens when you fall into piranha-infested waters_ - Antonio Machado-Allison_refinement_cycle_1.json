    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the typical number of piranhas found in a shoal of red-bellied piranhas?\n    - A: 1-5\n    - B: 10-100\n    - C: 100-500\n    - D: 500-1000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is unique about the teeth of piranhas?\n    - A: They are dull and non-interlocking\n    - B: They are sharp and non-interlocking\n    - C: They are dull and interlocking\n    - D: They are sharp and interlocking\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is the primary benefit of group-living for red-bellied piranhas?\n    - A: Cooperative hunting\n    - B: Protection from predators\n    - C: Increased aggression\n    - D: Improved communication\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is a common misconception about piranhas?\n    - A: They are slow swimmers\n    - B: They are primarily herbivorous\n    - C: They are typically aggressive towards humans\n    - D: They are only found in saltwater\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A researcher is studying piranha behavior in the wild. What can they do to minimize the risk of being attacked?\n    - A: Wear bright colors to scare them away\n    - B: Make loud noises to startle them\n    - C: Move calmly and avoid sudden movements\n    - D: Feed them to gain their trust\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) A zookeeper is designing a new enclosure for a group of red-bellied piranhas. What should they consider when creating the environment?\n    - A: Providing a large amount of space for individual piranhas\n    - B: Creating a complex communication system for the piranhas\n    - C: Incorporating plants and other hiding places for the piranhas\n    - D: Maintaining a constant water temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) A study found that piranhas in smaller groups had faster breathing rates than those in larger groups. What can be inferred from this data?\n    - A: Piranhas in smaller groups are more aggressive\n    - B: Piranhas in smaller groups are more anxious\n    - C: Piranhas in smaller groups are more relaxed\n    - D: Piranhas in smaller groups are more hungry\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the likely cause of aggressive behavior in piranhas?\n    - A: Overcrowding\n    - B: Starvation stress\n    - C: Changes in water temperature\n    - D: Presence of predators\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) A researcher is developing a new strategy for interacting with piranhas in the wild. What should they consider combining to create an effective approach?\n    - A: Knowledge of piranha behavior and communication\n    - B: Understanding of piranha social behavior and ecology\n    - C: Insights from piranha communication and animal behavior\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) A conservationist is working to promote a more accurate public perception of piranhas. What should they consider integrating to achieve this goal?\n    - A: Information about piranha behavior and ecology\n    - B: Insights from piranha communication and social behavior\n    - C: Data on piranha population sizes and habitats\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) Theodore Roosevelt's account of piranha behavior has been widely criticized for its inaccuracies. What can be said about the validity of his account?\n    - A: It is entirely accurate and reliable\n    - B: It is partially accurate but contains some exaggerations\n    - C: It is largely inaccurate and misleading\n    - D: It is impossible to determine its validity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) A documentary portrays piranhas as aggressive and bloodthirsty. What can be said about the portrayal?\n    - A: It is accurate and reflects the true nature of piranhas\n    - B: It is partially accurate but contains some exaggerations\n    - C: It is largely inaccurate and perpetuates negative stereotypes\n    - D: It is impossible to determine its accuracy\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nAfter refining the questions, I did not find any significant changes needed. The questions align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. The correct answers are accurate and supported by the transcript.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
