    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the food we eat is carbohydrates?\n    - A: 30%\n    - B: 40%\n    - C: 50%\n    - D: 60%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is the molecular formula for glucose?\n    - A: C-5-H-10-O-5\n    - B: C-6-H-12-O-6\n    - C: C-7-H-14-O-7\n    - D: C-8-H-16-O-8\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary role of chloroplasts in plant cells?\n    - A: To produce ATP through cellular respiration\n    - B: To absorb light energy and convert it into chemical energy\n    - C: To store energy in the form of starch and cellulose\n    - D: To regulate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the primary product of photosynthesis that plants use to build bigger and better carbohydrates?\n    - A: Starch\n    - B: Cellulose\n    - C: Glucose\n    - D: ATP\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is the primary source of energy for plants to undergo photosynthesis?\n    - A: Water\n    - B: Carbon dioxide\n    - C: Sunlight\n    - D: Soil\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How do humans benefit from the process of photosynthesis?\n    - A: By producing glucose for energy\n    - B: By producing oxygen for respiration\n    - C: By consuming plants that have undergone photosynthesis\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the production of glucose in plants and the energy needs of human cells?\n    - A: The production of glucose in plants increases the energy needs of human cells\n    - B: The production of glucose in plants decreases the energy needs of human cells\n    - C: The production of glucose in plants meets the energy needs of human cells\n    - D: There is no connection between the production of glucose in plants and the energy needs of human cells\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How do the roles of chloroplasts and mitochondria compare in terms of energy production?\n    - A: Chloroplasts produce ATP, while mitochondria produce glucose\n    - B: Chloroplasts produce glucose, while mitochondria produce ATP\n    - C: Both chloroplasts and mitochondria produce ATP\n    - D: Both chloroplasts and mitochondria produce glucose\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the complete energy cycle between plants and humans?\n    - A: Photosynthesis produces glucose, which is converted into ATP through cellular respiration\n    - B: Cellular respiration produces glucose, which is converted into ATP through photosynthesis\n    - C: Photosynthesis produces ATP, which is converted into glucose through cellular respiration\n    - D: Cellular respiration produces ATP, which is converted into glucose through photosynthesis\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) Why is photosynthesis important for human survival?\n    - A: Because it produces oxygen, which is necessary for human respiration\n    - B: Because it produces glucose, which is necessary for human energy needs\n    - C: Because it produces ATP, which is necessary for human energy needs\n    - D: Because it produces all of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is one potential impact of human activities on plant growth and photosynthesis?\n    - A: Increased plant growth and photosynthesis due to increased carbon dioxide levels\n    - B: Decreased plant growth and photosynthesis due to increased carbon dioxide levels\n    - C: Decreased plant growth and photosynthesis due to deforestation and climate change\n    - D: No impact on plant growth and photosynthesis\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How do plants use the energy from sunlight to undergo photosynthesis?\n    - A: By converting sunlight into chemical energy\n    - B: By converting sunlight into thermal energy\n    - C: By converting sunlight into kinetic energy\n    - D: By converting sunlight into potential energy\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 5 and 6 from the initial set, as they were not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript. I also rephrased some questions to make them more clear and concise. Additionally, I added new questions 5, 6, and 12 to cover important concepts that were not previously addressed."
