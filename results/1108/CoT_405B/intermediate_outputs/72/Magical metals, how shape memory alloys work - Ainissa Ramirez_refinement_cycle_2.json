    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is unique about shape memory alloys?\n    - A: They are extremely heavy\n    - B: They are metals that remember different shapes\n    - C: They are only used in high-temperature applications\n    - D: They are only used in electronic devices\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How small is an atom compared to everyday objects?\n    - A: As small as a grain of sand\n    - B: As small as a hair after being whittled 100,000 times\n    - C: As small as a cell\n    - D: As small as a molecule\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is a phase change in the context of atoms?\n    - A: When atoms move from one location to another\n    - B: When atoms change their chemical properties\n    - C: When atoms change their shape\n    - D: When atoms move from one seating arrangement to another\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What happens to the shape memory alloy wire when it is heated?\n    - A: It becomes brittle and breaks\n    - B: It changes color\n    - C: It returns to its original shape\n    - D: It becomes less rigid\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What are the two phases of the shape memory alloy wire mentioned in the transcript?\n    - A: Martensite and austenite\n    - B: Monoclinic and cubic\n    - C: Solid and liquid\n    - D: Alpha and beta\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) Where are shape memory alloys used, according to the transcript?\n    - A: Only in space exploration\n    - B: Only in medical devices\n    - C: In various applications, including space exploration, medical devices, and everyday objects\n    - D: Only in robotics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor changes to the questions to enhance clarity and conciseness, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also confirmed that the correct answers are accurate. No major changes were necessary, as the initial questions were well-written and aligned with the key concepts in the transcript."
