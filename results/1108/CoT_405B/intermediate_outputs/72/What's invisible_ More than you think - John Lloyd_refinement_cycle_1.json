    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) When was John Lloyd's TEDTalk given?\n    - A: 2005\n    - B: 2009\n    - C: 2010\n    - D: 2015\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) Approximately how many genes does the human genome contain?\n    - A: 10 thousand\n    - B: 20 thousand\n    - C: 30 thousand\n    - D: 40 thousand\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the concept of invisibility in the context of John Lloyd's TEDTalk?\n    - A: Only physical objects can be invisible.\n    - B: Invisibility extends beyond physical objects to include abstract concepts like gravity and time.\n    - C: Invisibility is limited to the physical world.\n    - D: Invisibility is a metaphor for the unknown.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n4) What is the speaker's stance on the existence of God?\n    - A: The speaker is an atheist.\n    - B: The speaker is a theist.\n    - C: The speaker is an immaterialist and an ignostic, refusing to take a stance without a clear definition.\n    - D: The speaker is agnostic but open to the idea of God.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n5) What can understanding the concept of invisibility lead to?\n    - A: A greater appreciation for the simplicity of the world.\n    - B: A greater appreciation for the complexity of the world and the limitations of human knowledge.\n    - C: A new perspective on the nature of reality.\n    - D: A focus solely on physical objects.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n6) How can recognizing the invisibility of abstract concepts like gravity and time inspire new approaches?\n    - A: By applying the concept of invisibility to inform new approaches to scientific inquiry.\n    - B: By ignoring the concept of invisibility.\n    - C: By limiting scientific inquiry to physical objects.\n    - D: By dismissing the importance of abstract concepts.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n7) What relationship is explored in John Lloyd's TEDTalk?\n    - A: The relationship between visibility and understanding is not explored.\n    - B: The relationship between visibility and understanding is explored, with the speaker suggesting that things that are invisible are often poorly understood.\n    - C: The relationship between physical and abstract worlds is highlighted.\n    - D: The relationship between human knowledge and the unknown is explored.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n8) What contrast is highlighted in John Lloyd's TEDTalk?\n    - A: The contrast between the complexity of the human genome and the simplicity of other organisms.\n    - B: The contrast between the physical and abstract worlds.\n    - C: The contrast between human knowledge and the unknown.\n    - D: The contrast between the complexity of the human genome and the simplicity of rice.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n9) How can the concept of invisibility be applied to various domains?\n    - A: The concept of invisibility is limited to science.\n    - B: The concept of invisibility can be applied to science, philosophy, and personal identity.\n    - C: The concept of invisibility is only relevant in philosophy.\n    - D: The concept of invisibility has implications for our understanding of the universe.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n10) What can the intersection of technology and human consciousness lead to?\n    - A: A lack of innovation.\n    - B: New insights and innovations.\n    - C: A focus solely on physical objects.\n    - D: A greater understanding of the human condition.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n11) What can be evaluated in the context of scientific theories and philosophical frameworks?\n    - A: The implications of the speaker's ideas on personal identity.\n    - B: The speaker's assertion that the laws of physics are invisible, eternal, and omnipresent.\n    - C: The speaker's conclusion that there are only two questions worth asking.\n    - D: The speaker's use of humor and anecdotes.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n12) What can be evaluated in the context of philosophical and existential frameworks?\n    - A: The implications of the speaker's ideas"
