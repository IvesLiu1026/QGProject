    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) What is the fundamental unit that makes up all living organisms?\n    - A: Cells\n    - B: Molecules\n    - C: Tissues\n    - D: Organs\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What type of sugar molecule is attached to each nucleotide base in DNA?\n    - A: Ribose\n    - B: Deoxyribose\n    - C: Glucose\n    - D: Fructose\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of genes in a living organism?\n    - A: To determine the organism's physical characteristics\n    - B: To produce proteins that perform specific functions\n    - C: To regulate the organism's metabolic processes\n    - D: To respond to environmental stimuli\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the result of changes in DNA gene sequences over millions of years?\n    - A: The development of new species\n    - B: The evolution of complex organisms\n    - C: The creation of genetic mutations\n    - D: The differences among living organisms\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) A genetic engineer wants to create a new crop variety that is resistant to pests. What would be the most likely approach?\n    - A: Introduce a gene from a pest-resistant species into the crop's DNA\n    - B: Use genetic testing to identify pest-resistant individuals\n    - C: Develop a new pesticide to control pests\n    - D: Use traditional breeding techniques to select for pest-resistant traits\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) A forensic scientist is analyzing DNA evidence from a crime scene. What would be the primary goal of the analysis?\n    - A: To identify the perpetrator's genetic disorders\n    - B: To determine the perpetrator's ancestry\n    - C: To match the DNA evidence to a suspect or a database\n    - D: To analyze the DNA for genetic mutations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between DNA, genes, and proteins?\n    - A: DNA determines the structure of proteins, which are encoded by genes\n    - B: Genes determine the structure of DNA, which encodes proteins\n    - C: Proteins determine the structure of DNA, which is encoded by genes\n    - D: DNA, genes, and proteins are unrelated\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) How does the number of genes in humans compare to other organisms, such as worms and plants?\n    - A: Humans have significantly more genes than other organisms\n    - B: Humans have significantly fewer genes than other organisms\n    - C: Humans have a similar number of genes to other organisms\n    - D: The number of genes varies greatly among all organisms\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What is the result of combining genetic information and environmental factors in the development and function of living organisms?\n    - A: The creation of new species\n    - B: The evolution of complex organisms\n    - C: The influence on an organism's traits and characteristics\n    - D: The development of genetic mutations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the implication of genetic mutations being both beneficial and detrimental, depending on the context?\n    - A: Genetic mutations should be eliminated\n    - B: Genetic mutations should be encouraged\n    - C: Genetic mutations should be carefully managed and regulated\n    - D: Genetic mutations have no impact on the organism\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) This question has been removed as it is not directly related to the transcript and is more of an opinion-based question.\n\n12) What is the justification for investing in genetic research?\n    - A: It has the potential to cure genetic diseases and improve human health\n    - B: It has the potential to create new technologies and industries\n    - C: It has the potential to improve crop yields and food security\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-10 and 12."
