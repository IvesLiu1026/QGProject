    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is the primary component that makes up all living organisms?\n    - A: Cells\n    - B: Molecules\n    - C: Tissues\n    - D: Organs\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the name of the sugar molecule that is attached to each nucleotide base in DNA?\n    - A: Ribose\n    - B: Deoxyribose\n    - C: Glucose\n    - D: Fructose\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What is the primary function of genes in a living organism?\n    - A: To determine the organism's physical characteristics\n    - B: To produce proteins that perform specific functions\n    - C: To regulate the organism's metabolic processes\n    - D: To respond to environmental stimuli\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the result of changes in DNA gene sequences over millions of years?\n    - A: The development of new species\n    - B: The evolution of complex organisms\n    - C: The creation of genetic mutations\n    - D: The differences among living organisms\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) A genetic engineer wants to create a new crop variety that is resistant to pests. What would be the most likely approach?\n    - A: Introduce a gene from a pest-resistant species into the crop's DNA\n    - B: Use genetic testing to identify pest-resistant individuals\n    - C: Develop a new pesticide to control pests\n    - D: Use traditional breeding techniques to select for pest-resistant traits\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) A forensic scientist is analyzing DNA evidence from a crime scene. What would be the primary goal of the analysis?\n    - A: To identify the perpetrator's genetic disorders\n    - B: To determine the perpetrator's ancestry\n    - C: To match the DNA evidence to a suspect or a database\n    - D: To analyze the DNA for genetic mutations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between DNA, genes, and proteins?\n    - A: DNA determines the structure of proteins, which are encoded by genes\n    - B: Genes determine the structure of DNA, which encodes proteins\n    - C: Proteins determine the structure of DNA, which is encoded by genes\n    - D: DNA, genes, and proteins are unrelated\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the contrast between the number of genes in humans and other organisms, such as worms and plants?\n    - A: Humans have significantly more genes than other organisms\n    - B: Humans have significantly fewer genes than other organisms\n    - C: Humans have a similar number of genes to other organisms\n    - D: The number of genes varies greatly among all organisms\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) What is the result of combining genetic information and environmental factors in the development and function of living organisms?\n    - A: The creation of new species\n    - B: The evolution of complex organisms\n    - C: The influence on an organism's traits and characteristics\n    - D: The development of genetic mutations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the implication of genetic mutations being both beneficial and detrimental, depending on the context?\n    - A: Genetic mutations should be eliminated\n    - B: Genetic mutations should be encouraged\n    - C: Genetic mutations should be carefully managed and regulated\n    - D: Genetic mutations have no impact on the organism\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) Is genetic engineering morally justifiable?\n    - A: Yes, it has the potential to improve human lives and the environment\n    - B: No, it is an unnatural and potentially harmful practice\n    - C: It depends on the specific application and context\n    - D: There is not enough information to make a judgment\n[Correct answer]: C (Note: This question requires critical thinking and evaluation, and the correct answer may vary depending on individual perspectives.)\n\n2) What is the justification for investing in genetic research?\n    - A: It has the potential to cure genetic diseases and improve human health\n    - B: It has the potential to create new technologies and industries\n    - C: It has the potential to improve crop yields and food security\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D"
