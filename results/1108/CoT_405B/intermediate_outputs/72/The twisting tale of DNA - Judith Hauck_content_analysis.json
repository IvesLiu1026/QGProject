    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. All living organisms are made of one or more cells.\n2. Every cell contains DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid).\n3. DNA is a double molecule made of chains of four smaller molecules called nucleotides.\n4. The sequence of nucleotides in the DNA chain determines the difference between organisms.\n5. The four nucleotide bases are made of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and phosphorus atoms.\n6. Each nucleotide base is attached to a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group.\n7. DNA can be thought of as a library of information.\n8. A gene is a segment of the DNA molecule.\n9. Genes contain information for making proteins.\n10. The human body contains between 25,000 and 40,000 genes.\n11. Other organisms (worms, plants, fruit flies) contain between 12,000 and 20,000 genes.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The structure of DNA and how it determines the form and function of living organisms.\n2. The concept of genes and how they contain information for making proteins.\n3. The process of how cells use DNA to make proteins (e.g., insulin).\n4. The idea that changes in DNA gene sequences (mutations) can affect the organism or its descendants.\n5. The concept that tiny changes in DNA gene sequences over millions of years create differences among living organisms.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. Genetic engineering: using knowledge of DNA and genes to create new organisms or modify existing ones.\n2. Medical applications: understanding how genetic mutations can cause diseases and developing treatments.\n3. Forensic science: using DNA analysis to identify individuals or solve crimes.\n4. Agriculture: using genetic knowledge to improve crop yields or develop new plant varieties.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. The relationship between DNA, genes, and proteins.\n2. The contrast between the simplicity of DNA's structure and its complex role in determining form and function.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between changes in DNA gene sequences and their impact on the organism or its descendants.\n4. The comparison between the number of genes in different organisms (humans, worms, plants, fruit flies).\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. The idea that the combination of genetic information and environmental factors influences the development and function of living organisms.\n2. The concept that genetic mutations can be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on the context.\n3. The understanding that the study of DNA and genetics has far-reaching implications for various fields, including medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. The ethics of genetic engineering: is it morally justifiable to modify organisms or create new ones?\n2. The implications of genetic testing: should individuals have access to their genetic information, and how should it be used?\n3. The responsibility of scientists and policymakers in regulating the use of genetic knowledge.\n4. The justification for investing in genetic research: what are the potential benefits and drawbacks?"
