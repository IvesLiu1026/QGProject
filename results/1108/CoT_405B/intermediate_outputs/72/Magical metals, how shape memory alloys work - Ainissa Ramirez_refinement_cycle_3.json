    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is unique about shape memory alloys?\n    - A: They are extremely heavy\n    - B: They are metals that can change their chemical properties\n    - C: They are metals that remember different shapes\n    - D: They are only used in high-temperature applications\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How small is an atom compared to everyday objects?\n    - A: As small as a grain of sand\n    - B: As small as a hair after being whittled 100,000 times\n    - C: As small as a cell\n    - D: As small as a molecule\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is a phase change in the context of atoms?\n    - A: When atoms move from one location to another\n    - B: When atoms change their chemical properties\n    - C: When atoms change their shape\n    - D: When atoms move from one seating arrangement to another\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What happens to the shape memory alloy wire when it is heated?\n    - A: It becomes brittle and breaks\n    - B: It changes color\n    - C: It returns to its original shape\n    - D: It becomes less rigid\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What are the two phases of the shape memory alloy wire mentioned in the transcript?\n    - A: Martensite and austenite\n    - B: Monoclinic and cubic\n    - C: Solid and liquid\n    - D: Alpha and beta\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) Where are shape memory alloys used, according to the transcript?\n    - A: Only in space exploration\n    - B: Only in medical devices\n    - C: In various applications, including space exploration, medical devices, and everyday objects\n    - D: Only in robotics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the name of the phase where the atoms are arranged in a diagonal pattern, similar to seats in a movie theater?\n    - A: Austenite\n    - B: Martensite\n    - C: Monoclinic\n    - D: Cubic\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the name of the phase where the atoms are arranged in columns, similar to seats on an airplane?\n    - A: Austenite\n    - B: Martensite\n    - C: Monoclinic\n    - D: Cubic\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nThese refined questions ensure that each question aligns with the key concepts in the transcript, enhances clarity and conciseness, confirms distractors are plausible but incorrect, and ensures correct answers are accurate."
