    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who proposed the hypothesis in 1874 that the four bonds of a saturated carbon atom point to the corners of a tetrahedron?\n    - A: Van't Hoff\n    - B: Louis Pasteur\n    - C: August Kekulé\n    - D: Friedrich Wöhler\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What term describes the spatial property where a chiral object is not the same as its mirror image?\n    - A: Optical isomerism\n    - B: Chirality\n    - C: Stereochemistry\n    - D: Structural isomerism\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the relationship between chirality and optical rotation?\n    - A: Chirality is a result of optical rotation\n    - B: Optical rotation is a result of chirality\n    - C: Chirality and optical rotation are unrelated\n    - D: Chirality and optical rotation are the same concept\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What concept explains how molecules can have the same composition but different three-dimensional arrangements?\n    - A: Structural isomerism\n    - B: Chirality\n    - C: Stereochemistry\n    - D: Optical isomerism\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) (Removed this question as it is similar to question 4)\n\n[Correct answer]: None\n\n6) A scientist is studying the properties of a chiral molecule. Which of the following is a likely observation?\n    - A: The molecule will not interact with light\n    - B: The molecule will interact differently with the two chiral components of light\n    - C: The molecule will have the same properties as its mirror image\n    - D: The molecule will not exhibit optical rotation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) Which everyday object is an example of chirality?\n    - A: A ball\n    - B: A screw\n    - C: A mirror\n    - D: A book\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What determines the chirality of a molecule?\n    - A: The number of atoms in the molecule\n    - B: The type of bonds in the molecule\n    - C: The three-dimensional structure of the molecule\n    - D: The molecular weight of the molecule\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the main difference between chiral and non-chiral objects?\n    - A: Chiral objects are symmetrical, while non-chiral objects are asymmetrical\n    - B: Chiral objects are asymmetrical, while non-chiral objects are symmetrical\n    - C: Chiral objects are the same as their mirror image, while non-chiral objects are not\n    - D: Chiral objects are not the same as their mirror image, while non-chiral objects are\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) (Removed this question as it is similar to question 3)\n\n[Correct answer]: None\n\n11) What is the connection between chirality and tetrahedral carbons in understanding the three-dimensional structure of molecules?\n    - A: Chirality is a result of tetrahedral carbons\n    - B: Tetrahedral carbons are a result of chirality\n    - C: Chirality and tetrahedral carbons are unrelated\n    - D: Chirality and tetrahedral carbons are both important concepts in understanding the three-dimensional structure of molecules\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What was the significance of Van't Hoff's hypothesis in the field of chemistry?\n    - A: It introduced the concept of chirality\n    - B: It explained the phenomenon of optical rotation\n    - C: It provided a new understanding of the three-dimensional structure of molecules\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n13) Why is chirality important in understanding the properties of molecules?\n    - A: It explains the phenomenon of optical rotation\n    - B: It provides a new understanding of the three-dimensional structure of molecules\n    - C: It is essential in understanding the properties of molecules in various fields, such as chemistry and biology\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made the following changes:\n\n- In question 4, I changed the correct answer from B to C, as stereochemistry is the broader concept that encompasses chirality and other three-dimensional arrangements.\n- I removed questions 5 and 10, as they were similar to other questions.\n- I made minor wording changes to some questions to improve clarity and concision.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
