    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary purpose of proofs in mathematics?\n    - A: To establish new mathematical theories without testing\n    - B: To provide a solid foundation for testing and building mathematical theories\n    - C: To disprove existing mathematical concepts\n    - D: To simplify complex mathematical formulas\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Who is credited with revolutionizing the way mathematics is written and presented, and is considered the father of geometry?\n    - A: Euclid of Alexandria\n    - B: Archimedes\n    - C: Pythagoras\n    - D: Abraham Lincoln\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) What are the fundamental rules or assumptions in mathematics established by Euclid called?\n    - A: Theorems\n    - B: Axioms\n    - C: Proofs\n    - D: Postulates\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What term describes two triangles that have the same size and shape?\n    - A: Similar\n    - B: Congruent\n    - C: Identical\n    - D: Equivalent\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What property states that every element is related to itself?\n    - A: Reflexive property\n    - B: Symmetric property\n    - C: Transitive property\n    - D: Associative property\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What does the abbreviation QED stand for, and what does it signify in a proof?\n    - A: Quod erat demonstrandum, signifying the beginning of a proof\n    - B: Quod erat demonstrandum, signifying the end of a proof\n    - C: Quod est dubium, signifying a doubtful statement\n    - D: Quod est certum, signifying a certain statement\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) Why did Abraham Lincoln keep a copy of Euclid's Elements on his bedside table?\n    - A: To improve his mathematical skills for a competition\n    - B: To prepare for a mathematics exam\n    - C: To keep his mind in shape\n    - D: To learn about architecture\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the name of the institute that offers a million-dollar prize for solving one of the \"millennium problems\"?\n    - A: Clay Mathematics Institute\n    - B: Euclid Mathematics Institute\n    - C: Mathematics Research Institute\n    - D: Theoretical Mathematics Institute\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) According to the transcript, what is one of the reasons why studying proofs is important?\n    - A: To win arguments\n    - B: To make a million dollars\n    - C: To advance essential parts of our world, such as architecture and internet security\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is the name of the book that Euclid wrote, which revolutionized the way mathematics is written and presented?\n    - A: Euclid's Elements\n    - B: Theorems and Proofs\n    - C: Geometry and Mathematics\n    - D: Axioms and Postulates\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-8. I added two new questions (9 and 10) to cover additional key concepts in the transcript."
