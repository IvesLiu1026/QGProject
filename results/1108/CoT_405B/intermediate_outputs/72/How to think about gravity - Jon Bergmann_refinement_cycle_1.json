    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In the equation for gravity, F = G x M1 x M2 / R^2, what does the variable G represent?\n    - A: The mass of object 1\n    - B: The universal gravitational constant\n    - C: The distance between the objects\n    - D: The mass of object 2\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How does the force of gravity change as the distance between two objects increases?\n    - A: It increases directly with distance\n    - B: It decreases directly with distance\n    - C: It decreases inversely with the square of the distance\n    - D: It remains constant\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) According to the law of gravity, what is the nature of the attraction between objects?\n    - A: Everything is repelled by everything else\n    - B: Only massive objects attract each other\n    - C: Everything is attracted to everything else\n    - D: Only objects with similar masses attract each other\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) Why does the earth move a relatively small distance when attracted to a rock?\n    - A: The rock has a larger mass than the earth\n    - B: The earth has a smaller mass than the rock\n    - C: The earth has a much larger mass than the rock\n    - D: The rock has no mass\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) An astronaut weighs 100 pounds on earth. If the moon has 1/6 of the earth's mass, how much would the astronaut weigh on the moon?\n    - A: 100 pounds\n    - B: 600 pounds\n    - C: 16.67 pounds\n    - D: 50 pounds\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) If the distance between two objects is doubled, what happens to the force of gravity between them?\n    - A: It increases by a factor of 2\n    - B: It decreases by a factor of 2\n    - C: It decreases by a factor of 4\n    - D: It remains the same\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the mass of an object and its gravitational attraction to other objects?\n    - A: Inversely proportional\n    - B: Directly proportional\n    - C: No relationship\n    - D: Exponentially related\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the force of gravity change with the distance between objects?\n    - A: It increases with the square of the distance\n    - B: It decreases with the square of the distance\n    - C: It remains the same regardless of distance\n    - D: It increases linearly with distance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be inferred about the behavior of objects with mass based on the concepts of gravity and magnetism?\n    - A: Objects with mass are only attracted to each other through magnetism\n    - B: Objects with mass are only attracted to each other through gravity\n    - C: Objects with mass can exhibit both gravitational and magnetic attraction\n    - D: Objects with mass do not exhibit any attraction\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How does the equation for gravity relate to the motion of objects in the real world?\n    - A: It only applies to objects on earth\n    - B: It only applies to objects in space\n    - C: It can be used to predict the motion of objects in various environments\n    - D: It is not relevant to the motion of objects\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a limitation of the law of gravity in explaining the cause of gravity?\n    - A: It does not account for the role of magnetism\n    - B: It does not explain why objects have mass\n    - C: It does not describe the underlying mechanism by which gravity acts\n    - D: It is not mathematically precise\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a strength of comparing gravity to magnetism?\n    - A: It highlights the differences between the two forces\n    - B: It shows that gravity is a weaker force than magnetism\n    - C: It illustrates the similarities between the two forces\n    - D: It proves that gravity is not a real force\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more significant refinement is needed, but minor adjustments can be made based on further feedback."
