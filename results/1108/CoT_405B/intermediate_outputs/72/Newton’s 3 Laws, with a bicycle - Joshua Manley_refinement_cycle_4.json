    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who is credited with describing the fundamental laws of motion in the 17th century?\n    - A: Galileo Galilei\n    - B: Isaac Newton\n    - C: Albert Einstein\n    - D: Leonardo da Vinci\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is another name for Newton's First Law?\n    - A: The Law of Gravity\n    - B: The Law of Inertia\n    - C: The Law of Motion\n    - D: The Law of Energy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) According to Newton's laws of motion, why is it more difficult to start pedaling a bicycle than to ride at a constant speed?\n    - A: Because the bicycle has more friction when it's not moving\n    - B: Because it takes more force to overcome the initial inertia\n    - C: Because the rider is more tired when starting to pedal\n    - D: Because the bicycle's mass increases when it's not moving\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make distractor D more plausible but incorrect.\n\n4) What happens to an object's motion when no external force is applied, according to Newton's First Law?\n    - A: It accelerates\n    - B: It decelerates\n    - C: It remains at rest or continues moving at a constant velocity\n    - D: It changes direction randomly\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make distractor D more plausible but incorrect.\n\n5) According to Newton's Second Law, what happens to an object's acceleration when more force is applied to it?\n    - A: It decreases\n    - B: It remains the same\n    - C: It increases\n    - D: It becomes unstable\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make distractor D more plausible but incorrect.\n\n6) A cyclist is having trouble pedaling a heavy bicycle. Which concept from Newton's laws of motion best explains this difficulty?\n    - A: The Law of Gravity\n    - B: The concept of action/reaction pairs\n    - C: The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration\n    - D: The Law of Energy\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make distractor D more plausible but incorrect.\n\n7) What is the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, according to Newton's Second Law?\n    - A: Force is the product of mass and velocity\n    - B: Force is the product of mass and acceleration\n    - C: Force is the product of velocity and acceleration\n    - D: Force is the product of mass and time squared\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make distractor D more plausible but incorrect.\n\n8) A bouncy ball hits the floor. Which concept from Newton's laws of motion best explains the ball's motion?\n    - A: The Law of Inertia\n    - B: The concept of action/reaction pairs\n    - C: The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration\n    - D: The Law of Gravity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) How do the size and mass of an object affect its motion, according to Newton's laws of motion?\n    - A: It has no effect on the object's motion\n    - B: It only affects the object's velocity\n    - C: It only affects the object's acceleration\n    - D: It affects both the object's velocity and acceleration, but only when an external force is applied\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more accurate and specific.\n\n10) According to Newton's Third Law, what happens when an object exerts a force on another object?\n    - A: The other object exerts a smaller force in the opposite direction\n    - B: The other object exerts an equal force in the same direction\n    - C: The other object exerts an equal force in the opposite direction\n    - D: The other object exerts a greater force in the opposite direction\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make distractor D more plausible but incorrect."
