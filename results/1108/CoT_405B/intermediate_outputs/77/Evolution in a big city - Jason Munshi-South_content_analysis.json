    "content_analysis": "Here's the analysis of the transcript, categorized under each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge:**\n\n1. New York City has native wildlife, including northern dusky salamanders and white-footed mice.\n2. The city's infrastructure, such as bridges, can affect the evolutionary history of species.\n3. Coyotes are moving into New York City for the first time.\n4. White-footed mice are a native species that has been in the city for a long time.\n5. The five boroughs were once covered in forests and other vegetation.\n6. DNA sequencing can be used to determine the origin of a mouse.\n7. Genes are short segments of DNA that code for amino acids.\n8. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. The speaker is encouraging the audience to think about New York City as a place where native wildlife is subject to a grand evolutionary experiment.\n2. The city's infrastructure can divide populations of species, leading to genetic differences.\n3. The speaker's lab is studying the evolutionary history of species in the city, including the northern dusky salamander and the white-footed mouse.\n4. The white-footed mouse is being used as a model to understand how species adapt to urban environments.\n5. The speaker is comparing the genetics of city mice to country mice to understand the changes that are occurring in their biology.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. The study of evolutionary biology in urban environments can inform conservation efforts.\n2. Understanding how species adapt to urban environments can help us design more effective conservation strategies.\n3. The speaker's research can be applied to other cities to understand how urbanization affects native wildlife.\n4. The study of genetics can be used to inform public health policy, such as understanding the spread of disease in urban populations.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The speaker is analyzing the genetic differences between city mice and country mice to understand the changes that are occurring in their biology.\n2. The study of evolutionary biology in urban environments requires an understanding of the relationships between species, their environments, and the infrastructure of the city.\n3. The speaker is identifying the genes that are most different between city and country mice, and analyzing their functions to understand the changes that are occurring in their biology.\n4. The speaker is comparing the genetics of mice from different parks in the city to understand how they are adapting to their environments.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. The speaker is combining ideas from evolutionary biology, genetics, and ecology to understand how species adapt to urban environments.\n2. The study of evolutionary biology in urban environments requires an understanding of the complex relationships between species, their environments, and the infrastructure of the city.\n3. The speaker is using DNA sequencing and other genetic techniques to understand the changes that are occurring in the biology of urban species.\n4. The speaker is encouraging the audience to think about the city as a place where native wildlife is subject to a grand evolutionary experiment, and to consider the implications of this for conservation and public health policy.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. The speaker is evaluating the effectiveness of conservation efforts in urban environments.\n2. The study of evolutionary biology in urban environments requires an evaluation of the complex relationships between species, their environments, and the infrastructure of the city.\n3. The speaker is evaluating the genetic differences between city mice and country mice to understand the changes that are occurring in their biology.\n4. The speaker is encouraging the audience to evaluate the implications of urbanization for native wildlife and to consider the role of humans in shaping the evolutionary history of species."
