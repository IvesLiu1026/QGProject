    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is an example of a native species that has been in New York City for a long time?\n    - A: Coyotes\n    - B: Gray squirrels\n    - C: White-footed mice\n    - D: Raccoons\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the primary function of genes in an organism?\n    - A: To synthesize proteins\n    - B: To divide cells\n    - C: To code for amino acids\n    - D: To regulate body temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the main idea behind the speaker's comparison of city mice and country mice?\n    - A: To understand the differences in their diets\n    - B: To understand the changes that are occurring in their biology due to urbanization\n    - C: To understand their social behaviors\n    - D: To understand their habitats\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the speaker's primary goal in studying the evolutionary history of species in New York City?\n    - A: To understand how species adapt to urban environments\n    - B: To understand the impact of climate change on native wildlife\n    - C: To understand the role of humans in shaping the evolutionary history of species\n    - D: To understand the relationships between species and their environments\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) How can the study of evolutionary biology in urban environments inform conservation efforts?\n    - A: By providing insights into the impact of climate change on native wildlife\n    - B: By providing insights into the spread of disease in urban populations\n    - C: By providing insights into how species adapt to urban environments\n    - D: By providing insights into the role of humans in shaping the evolutionary history of species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential application of the speaker's research on the genetics of city mice?\n    - A: Understanding the spread of disease in urban populations\n    - B: Understanding the impact of climate change on native wildlife\n    - C: Designing more effective conservation strategies\n    - D: Understanding the relationships between species and their environments\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the speaker analyzing to understand the changes that are occurring in the biology of urban species?\n    - A: The genetic differences between city mice and country mice\n    - B: The diets of city mice and country mice\n    - C: The social behaviors of city mice and country mice\n    - D: The habitats of city mice and country mice\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is the speaker identifying and analyzing to understand the changes that are occurring in the biology of urban species?\n    - A: The genes that are most similar between city and country mice\n    - B: The genes that are most different between city and country mice\n    - C: The amino acids that are most abundant in city mice\n    - D: The proteins that are most abundant in country mice\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the speaker using to understand the changes that are occurring in the biology of urban species?\n    - A: DNA sequencing and other genetic techniques\n    - B: Observations of animal behavior and habitat analysis\n    - C: Statistical models and computer simulations\n    - D: Experiments and field studies\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is the speaker encouraging the audience to evaluate?\n    - A: The implications of urbanization for native wildlife\n    - B: The effectiveness of conservation efforts in urban environments\n    - C: The impact of climate change on native wildlife\n    - D: The role of humans in shaping the evolutionary history of species\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were not directly related to the main concepts in the transcript. I also rephrased some of the questions to make them more concise and clear. Additionally, I changed some of the distractors to make them more plausible but incorrect."
