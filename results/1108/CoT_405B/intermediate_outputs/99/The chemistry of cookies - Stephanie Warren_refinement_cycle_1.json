    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) At what temperature does water boil?\n    - A: 180 degrees Fahrenheit\n    - B: 200 degrees Fahrenheit\n    - C: 212 degrees Fahrenheit\n    - D: 220 degrees Fahrenheit\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What happens to Salmonella bacteria when exposed to 136 degrees Fahrenheit?\n    - A: They multiply rapidly\n    - B: They become dormant\n    - C: They die\n    - D: They are unaffected\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What happens to the proteins in eggs when exposed to heat energy?\n    - A: They break down and become liquid\n    - B: They change structure and become more solid\n    - C: They remain unchanged\n    - D: They become less solid\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is the result of the Maillard reaction in baking?\n    - A: The breakdown of sugar molecules\n    - B: The denaturation of proteins\n    - C: The creation of a tough, dense texture\n    - D: The production of flavor and aroma compounds\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined to make option D more specific: \n4) What is the primary outcome of the Maillard reaction in baking?\n    - A: The breakdown of sugar molecules\n    - B: The denaturation of proteins\n    - C: The creation of a tough, dense texture\n    - D: The formation of new flavor and aroma compounds through the reaction of proteins and sugars\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) A baker wants to achieve the perfect cookie color and flavor. What temperature range should they aim for to facilitate the Maillard reaction and caramelization?\n    - A: 200-250 degrees Fahrenheit\n    - B: 250-300 degrees Fahrenheit\n    - C: 300-350 degrees Fahrenheit\n    - D: 350-400 degrees Fahrenheit\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) A recipe calls for baking soda as a leavening agent. What is the likely result of using baking soda in the recipe?\n    - A: A dense and heavy texture\n    - B: A light and flaky texture\n    - C: A sour and unpleasant flavor\n    - D: A sweet and overpowering flavor\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between temperature and the survival of Salmonella bacteria in eggs?\n    - A: Higher temperatures increase the risk of Salmonella survival\n    - B: Lower temperatures increase the risk of Salmonella survival\n    - C: Temperature has no impact on Salmonella survival\n    - D: Higher temperatures decrease the risk of Salmonella survival\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the connection between the Maillard reaction and caramelization in baking?\n    - A: They are two separate and unrelated reactions\n    - B: They are competing reactions that cancel each other out\n    - C: They are complementary reactions that contribute to flavor and aroma\n    - D: They are identical reactions with the same outcome\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) A baker wants to create a cookie with a rich, complex flavor profile. What combination of factors is likely to achieve this outcome?\n    - A: High temperature, low sugar content, and no leavening agents\n    - B: Low temperature, high sugar content, and baking soda\n    - C: High temperature, high sugar content, and baking soda\n    - D: Low temperature, low sugar content, and no leavening agents\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) A baker wants to create a cookie with a light and flaky texture. What combination of factors is likely to achieve this outcome?\n    - A: High temperature, high sugar content, and no leavening agents\n    - B: Low temperature, low sugar content, and baking soda\n    - C: High temperature, low sugar content, and baking soda\n    - D: Low temperature, high sugar content, and no leavening agents\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is the importance of temperature control in baking?\n    - A: It is a minor factor with little impact on the final product\n    - B: It is a moderate factor with some impact on the final product\n    - C: It is a critical factor with significant impact on the final product\n    - D: It is an irrelevant factor with no impact on the final product\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What is the optimal level of browning and flavor development in a cookie?\n    - A: It depends on personal preference and recipe goals\n    - B: It is always a dark brown color with a strong flavor\n    - C: It is always a light brown color with a mild flavor\n    - D: It is always a golden brown color with a moderate flavor\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nHowever, I suggest adding more questions to cover other key concepts in the transcript, such as the role of butter and eggs in cookie dough, the effect of heat on protein structure, and the importance of leavening agents."
