    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the term used to describe the practice of eating bugs?\n    - A: Entomology\n    - B: Entomophagy\n    - C: Insectivory\n    - D: Bug eating\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) Approximately how many insect species are consumed as food worldwide?\n    - A: 500\n    - B: 1,000\n    - C: 2,000\n    - D: 5,000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the historical significance of entomophagy in human diets?\n    - A: It was a rare practice limited to a few cultures\n    - B: It was a common practice among early hunter-gatherers and ancient civilizations\n    - C: It was only practiced in times of food scarcity\n    - D: It was a taboo practice across all cultures\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is the main reason for the shift in attitudes towards bugs as pests with the advent of agriculture?\n    - A: Increased availability of other protein sources\n    - B: Decreased nutritional value of insects\n    - C: Cultural influence of Western societies\n    - D: Rise of urbanization and separation from nature\n[Correct answer]: D (Refined to better match the transcript)\n\n5) A non-profit organization wants to promote entomophagy as a sustainable food source in a developing country. What would be a suitable approach?\n    - A: Importing insect-based food products from Western countries\n    - B: Establishing large-scale insect farms\n    - C: Educating local communities about the benefits of entomophagy and providing training on small-scale insect farming\n    - D: Partnering with local restaurants to offer insect-based dishes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) A food company wants to incorporate insects into their products as a sustainable alternative to traditional livestock. What would be a suitable product to start with?\n    - A: Insect-based burgers\n    - B: Insect-based energy bars\n    - C: Insect-based flour for baked goods\n    - D: Insect-based milk alternatives\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between the rise of agriculture and the decline of entomophagy in Western cultures?\n    - A: The rise of agriculture led to an increase in entomophagy\n    - B: The rise of agriculture led to a decline in entomophagy due to increased availability of other protein sources\n    - C: The rise of agriculture had no impact on entomophagy\n    - D: The decline of entomophagy led to the rise of agriculture\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to: \n7) What is the relationship between the rise of agriculture and the decline of entomophagy in Western cultures?\n    - A: The rise of agriculture led to an increase in entomophagy\n    - B: The rise of agriculture led to a decline in entomophagy due to changes in attitudes towards insects\n    - C: The rise of agriculture had no impact on entomophagy\n    - D: The decline of entomophagy led to the rise of agriculture\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the main cause of the \"ick factor\" associated with entomophagy in Western cultures?\n    - A: Cultural influence of tropical countries\n    - B: Lack of education about the benefits of entomophagy\n    - C: Historical and cultural associations of insects as pests\n    - D: Availability of other protein sources\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) How can entomophagy be integrated into Western diets as a sustainable and nutritious alternative to traditional protein sources?\n    - A: By importing insect-based food products from tropical countries\n    - B: By establishing large-scale insect farms and promoting insect-based products\n    - C: By educating consumers about the benefits of entomophagy and incorporating insects into existing food products\n    - D: By developing new food products that mimic the taste and texture of traditional protein sources\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What would be a suitable approach to designing sustainable insect farming systems?\n    - A: Focusing on maximizing yields and minimizing costs\n    - B: Prioritizing environmental sustainability and social responsibility\n    - C: Using traditional livestock farming methods as a model\n    - D: Ignoring the environmental impact of insect farming\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is the main cultural barrier to adopting entomophagy in Western societies?\n    - A: Lack of education about the benefits of entomophagy\n    - B: Historical and cultural associations of insects as pests\n    - C: Availability of other protein sources\n    - D: Economic feasibility of large-scale insect farming\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) How can the environmental benefits of insect farming be justified compared to traditional livestock farming?\n    - A: By highlighting the lower greenhouse gas emissions of insect farming\n    - B: By emphasizing the higher nutritional value of insect-based products\n    - C: By comparing the land use requirements of insect farming and traditional livestock farming\n    - D: By ignoring the environmental impact of traditional livestock farming\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nThe questions are now more refined and accurate, with plausible but incorrect distractors."
