    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge** (Specific facts or details that can be recalled directly):\n1. Human eyes can only see a minuscule part of the full spectrum of light.\n2. Different kinds of light include radio waves, x-rays, microwaves, and visible light.\n3. Light is electromagnetic radiation that acts like both a wave and a particle.\n4. The size of a wave is called its wavelength, and how often it comes by is called its frequency.\n5. Long wavelengths have low energies, while short wavelengths have high energies.\n6. The energy of light tells us how it will interact with matter.\n7. The retina is only sensitive to light with a very small range in energy, which we call visible light.\n8. Rods in the retina measure brightness, while cones are in charge of what color of light we see.\n9. Different cones are sensitive to different energies of light.\n10. Radio waves have long wavelengths, while x-rays have short wavelengths.\n11. Visible light is somewhere in between radio waves and x-rays in terms of wavelength.\n12. There are 20 space telescopes in orbit, each capable of seeing part of the full spectrum of light.\n\n**Comprehension** (Important concepts that require understanding or interpretation):\n1. The concept of the full spectrum of light and how it relates to human vision.\n2. The relationship between wavelength, frequency, and energy of light.\n3. How the retina and its components (rods and cones) interact with light to produce vision.\n4. The idea that different types of light are all part of the same electromagnetic spectrum.\n5. The concept of using special detectors and telescopes to measure and study light outside of the visible range.\n\n**Application** (Scenarios or real-world applications where the content can be applied):\n1. Using knowledge of the electromagnetic spectrum to understand how different technologies work (e.g., radio, microwaves, x-rays).\n2. Applying the concept of wavelength and frequency to real-world problems (e.g., designing antennas or filters).\n3. Using telescopes and other detectors to study the universe in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n4. Developing new technologies that utilize different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., medical imaging, communication systems).\n5. Understanding how the human eye responds to different types of light and how this relates to vision and perception.\n\n**Analysis** (Relationships, contrasts, or cause-and-effect connections in the content):\n1. The relationship between wavelength and energy of light, and how this affects its interaction with matter.\n2. The contrast between the limited range of human vision and the full spectrum of light that exists.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the energy of light and its ability to stimulate the retina.\n4. The relationship between the structure of the retina (rods and cones) and its function in producing vision.\n5. The connection between the electromagnetic spectrum and the different types of light that exist (radio waves, x-rays, visible light, etc.).\n\n**Synthesis** (Combining ideas to form new understanding):\n1. Integrating knowledge of the electromagnetic spectrum with understanding of human vision to appreciate the limitations and capabilities of human perception.\n2. Combining concepts of wavelength, frequency, and energy to understand how different types of light interact with matter.\n3. Synthesizing information about the retina and its components with understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum to appreciate the complex process of vision.\n4. Merging knowledge of telescopes and detectors with understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum to appreciate the possibilities for studying the universe.\n5. Integrating concepts of light and its interactions with matter to understand the natural world and our place within it.\n\n**Evaluation** (Judgment, critique, or justification):\n1. Evaluating the limitations and capabilities of human vision in relation to the full spectrum of light.\n2. Justifying the use of special detectors and telescopes to study light outside of the visible range.\n3. Critiquing the idea that the human eye is capable of perceiving the full range of electromagnetic radiation.\n4. Evaluating the significance of understanding the electromagnetic spectrum in relation to technological advancements and scientific discovery.\n5. Justifying the importance of continued research and exploration of the electromagnetic spectrum."
