    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the term used to describe the practice of eating bugs?\n    - A: Entomology\n    - B: Entomophagy\n    - C: Insectivory\n    - D: Bug eating\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Approximately how many insect species are consumed as food worldwide?\n    - A: 500\n    - B: 1,000\n    - C: 2,000\n    - D: 5,000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the historical significance of entomophagy in human diets?\n    - A: It was a rare practice limited to a few cultures\n    - B: It was a common practice among early hunter-gatherers and ancient civilizations\n    - C: It was only practiced in times of food scarcity\n    - D: It was a taboo practice across all cultures\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the main reason for the shift in attitudes towards bugs as pests with the advent of agriculture?\n    - A: Increased availability of other protein sources\n    - B: Decreased nutritional value of insects\n    - C: Cultural influence of Western societies\n    - D: Rise of urbanization and separation from nature\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) A non-profit organization wants to promote entomophagy as a sustainable food source in a developing country. What would be a suitable approach?\n    - A: Importing insect-based food products from Western countries\n    - B: Establishing large-scale insect farms\n    - C: Educating local communities about the benefits of entomophagy and providing training on small-scale insect farming\n    - D: Partnering with local restaurants to offer insect-based dishes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential benefit of incorporating insects into food products?\n    - A: Higher greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: Lower nutritional value\n    - C: Increased food security and sustainability\n    - D: Decreased consumer acceptance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the rise of agriculture and the decline of entomophagy in Western cultures?\n    - A: The rise of agriculture led to an increase in entomophagy\n    - B: The rise of agriculture led to a decline in entomophagy due to changes in attitudes towards insects\n    - C: The rise of agriculture had no impact on entomophagy\n    - D: The decline of entomophagy led to the rise of agriculture\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the main cause of the \"ick factor\" associated with entomophagy in Western cultures?\n    - A: Cultural influence of tropical countries\n    - B: Lack of education about the benefits of entomophagy\n    - C: Historical and cultural associations of insects as pests\n    - D: Availability of other protein sources\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can entomophagy be integrated into Western diets as a sustainable and nutritious alternative to traditional protein sources?\n    - A: By importing insect-based food products from tropical countries\n    - B: By establishing large-scale insect farms and promoting insect-based products\n    - C: By educating consumers about the benefits of entomophagy and incorporating insects into existing food products\n    - D: By developing new food products that mimic the taste and texture of traditional protein sources\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What would be a suitable approach to designing sustainable insect farming systems?\n    - A: Focusing on maximizing yields and minimizing costs\n    - B: Prioritizing environmental sustainability and social responsibility\n    - C: Using traditional livestock farming methods as a model\n    - D: Ignoring the environmental impact of insect farming\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a key environmental benefit of insect farming compared to traditional livestock farming?\n    - A: Higher greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: Lower water usage\n    - C: Increased land use requirements\n    - D: Lower greenhouse gas emissions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is the main cultural barrier to adopting entomophagy in Western societies?\n    - A: Lack of education about the benefits of entomophagy\n    - B: Historical and cultural associations of insects as pests\n    - C: Availability of other protein sources\n    - D: Economic feasibility of large-scale insect farming\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nAfter reviewing the questions, I did not find any significant issues that required major refinements. The questions are clear, concise, and align with the key concepts in the transcript. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. Therefore, I conclude that:\n\nNo more refinement needed."
