    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How long have mosquitoes been present on Earth?\n    - A: Over 10 million years\n    - B: Over 100 million years\n    - C: Over 500 million years\n    - D: Over 1 billion years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the estimated annual number of human deaths caused by mosquito-borne diseases?\n    - A: Over 100,000\n    - B: Over 500,000\n    - C: Over 1 million\n    - D: Over 5 million\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary function of a mosquito's saliva during feeding?\n    - A: To numb the skin and prevent the victim from noticing the attack\n    - B: To increase blood flow to the affected area\n    - C: To inject disease-causing pathogens into the host\n    - D: To reduce inflammation and prevent scarring\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What would be a potential consequence of eliminating mosquitoes for plants?\n    - A: They would lose a primary pollinator\n    - B: They would gain a new pollinator\n    - C: They would experience increased growth rates\n    - D: They would experience decreased growth rates\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) What is a common method used to repel mosquitoes?\n    - A: Using citronella candles and bug sprays\n    - B: Eliminating standing water around homes\n    - C: Planting mosquito-repellent plants\n    - D: Using mosquito nets\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is a potential consequence of mosquito-borne diseases on human health?\n    - A: Increased risk of heart disease\n    - B: Increased risk of cancer\n    - C: Increased risk of infectious diseases such as malaria and yellow fever\n    - D: Increased risk of mental health disorders\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the role of mosquitoes in the transmission of diseases?\n    - A: Mosquitoes are the primary hosts for these diseases\n    - B: Mosquitoes are the primary vectors for these diseases\n    - C: Mosquitoes are immune to these diseases\n    - D: Mosquitoes are the primary victims of these diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a potential trade-off between the benefits and risks of eliminating mosquitoes?\n    - A: Reduced disease transmission vs. increased risk of ecosystem disruption\n    - B: Increased disease transmission vs. reduced risk of ecosystem disruption\n    - C: Reduced disease transmission vs. increased risk of climate change\n    - D: Increased disease transmission vs. reduced risk of climate change\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What might be a potential consequence of eliminating mosquitoes on human health and the environment?\n    - A: Reduced disease transmission and improved ecosystem health\n    - B: Reduced disease transmission and disrupted ecosystem health\n    - C: Increased disease transmission and improved ecosystem health\n    - D: Increased disease transmission and disrupted ecosystem health\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What might happen if mosquitoes were eliminated and another species took their place?\n    - A: The ecosystem would likely remain unchanged\n    - B: The ecosystem would likely experience unforeseen consequences\n    - C: The ecosystem would likely experience improved health\n    - D: The ecosystem would likely experience reduced biodiversity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What should be considered when weighing the potential benefits and risks of eliminating mosquitoes?\n    - A: Only the benefits of reduced disease transmission\n    - B: Only the risks of ecosystem disruption\n    - C: Both the benefits and risks, as well as the complexity of ecosystems\n    - D: The opinions of scientists and the general public\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a limitation of the idea that mosquitoes are not important and that another species would simply take their place?\n    - A: It underestimates the complexity of ecosystems\n    - B: It overestimates the importance of mosquitoes\n    - C: It ignores the potential consequences of eliminating mosquitoes\n    - D: It assumes that another species would have the same role as mosquitoes\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 1, 5, 11, and 12 to improve clarity and concision. The other questions remained unchanged, as they were deemed to be clear and effective in assessing understanding of the key concepts."
