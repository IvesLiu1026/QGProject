    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) What type of bond is formed when one atom pulls electrons off another atom, resulting in opposite charges?\n    - A: Covalent bond\n    - B: Ionic bond\n    - C: Hydrogen bond\n    - D: Electrostatic bond\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the arrangement of ions in a substance held together by ionic bonds called?\n    - A: Lattice\n    - B: Molecule\n    - C: Crystal\n    - D: Grid\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) What is the main difference between ionic and covalent bonds?\n    - A: Ionic bonds involve the sharing of electrons, while covalent bonds involve the transfer of electrons.\n    - B: Ionic bonds involve the transfer of electrons, while covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons.\n    - C: Ionic bonds are stronger than covalent bonds.\n    - D: Covalent bonds are weaker than ionic bonds.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What determines an atom's ability to form bonds?\n    - A: The number of protons in the nucleus\n    - B: The arrangement of electrons in the atom\n    - C: The size of the atom\n    - D: The charge of the atom\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n\n1) A chemist wants to design a new material with specific properties. What type of bond would they likely use to create a strong and rigid structure?\n    - A: Covalent bond\n    - B: Ionic bond\n    - C: Hydrogen bond\n    - D: Electrostatic bond\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A biologist is studying the structure of a protein. What type of bond would they expect to find holding the protein together?\n    - A: Ionic bond\n    - B: Covalent bond\n    - C: Hydrogen bond\n    - D: Electrostatic bond\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the number of electrons available for bonding and an atom's ability to form multiple bonds?\n    - A: The more electrons available, the fewer bonds an atom can form.\n    - B: The fewer electrons available, the more bonds an atom can form.\n    - C: The number of electrons available determines the type of bond an atom can form.\n    - D: The number of electrons available determines the number of bonds an atom can form.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is the main difference between the electron arrangement of an atom that forms ionic bonds and one that forms covalent bonds?\n    - A: The number of electrons in the outermost energy level\n    - B: The arrangement of electrons in the outermost energy level\n    - C: The number of protons in the nucleus\n    - D: The size of the atom\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) A materials scientist wants to design a new material with both ionic and covalent bonds. What properties would they expect this material to have?\n    - A: Strong and rigid, but brittle\n    - B: Weak and flexible, but ductile\n    - C: Strong and flexible, but prone to cracking\n    - D: Weak and rigid, but resistant to corrosion\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) A chemist is trying to predict the behavior of a molecule with a complex structure. What factors would they need to consider to make an accurate prediction?\n    - A: Only the type of bonds present\n    - B: Only the arrangement of electrons in the atoms\n    - C: Both the type of bonds present and the arrangement of electrons in the atoms\n    - D: Neither the type of bonds present nor the arrangement of electrons in the atoms\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) Which type of bond is generally considered stronger and more stable?\n    - A: Ionic bond\n    - B: Covalent bond\n    - C: Hydrogen bond\n    - D: Electrostatic bond\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Why is the electron arrangement of an atom important in determining its ability to form bonds?\n    - A: Because it determines the number of electrons available for bonding\n    - B: Because it determines the type of bond an atom can form\n    - C: Because it determines the strength and stability of the bond\n    - D: Because it determines the size of the atom\n[Correct answer]: A"
