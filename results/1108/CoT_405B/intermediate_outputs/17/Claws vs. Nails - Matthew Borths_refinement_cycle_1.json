    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary component of both nails and claws?\n    - A: Bone\n    - B: Keratin\n    - C: Muscle\n    - D: Tendon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Approximately how long ago did nails first appear in the fossil record?\n    - A: 100 million years ago\n    - B: 55.8 million years ago\n    - C: 260 million years ago\n    - D: 500 million years ago\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary difference between nails and claws?\n    - A: Their function\n    - B: Their shape, which depends on the shape of the bone at the end of the animal's digits\n    - C: Their composition\n    - D: Their size\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is closely linked to the evolution of nails in primates?\n    - A: The development of sharper teeth\n    - B: The evolution of stronger arms\n    - C: The development of wider, more dexterous fingers\n    - D: The evolution of opposable thumbs and toes\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What can the study of the structure and function of nails and claws inform?\n    - A: The design of tools and technology\n    - B: The development of new species\n    - C: The evolution of the human brain\n    - D: The study of plant biology\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What can the unique properties of keratin be applied to?\n    - A: The development of new medicines\n    - B: The creation of new materials\n    - C: The study of animal behavior\n    - D: The development of new energy sources\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the shape of the bone at the end of an animal's digits and the shape of the nail or claw?\n    - A: The shape of the bone determines the shape of the nail or claw\n    - B: The shape of the nail or claw determines the shape of the bone\n    - C: There is no relationship between the two\n    - D: The shape of the bone and the nail or claw are influenced by different factors\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is a key difference in the advantages of nails and claws in different environments?\n    - A: Nails are better suited for aquatic environments, while claws are better suited for terrestrial environments\n    - B: Nails are better suited for forest environments, while claws are better suited for grassland environments\n    - C: Nails are better suited for cold climates, while claws are better suited for warm climates\n    - D: Nails are better suited for arboreal environments, while claws are better suited for terrestrial environments\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) How could the knowledge of keratin's properties and the structure of nails and claws be combined to develop new materials or technologies?\n    - A: By creating materials that mimic the strength and flexibility of keratin\n    - B: By developing technologies that use keratin as a primary component\n    - C: By studying the evolution of keratin in different species\n    - D: By creating materials that are completely different from keratin\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) How could the understanding of the evolution of nails and claws inform the study of animal adaptations?\n    - A: By providing insights into the development of new species\n    - B: By highlighting the importance of nails and claws in different environments\n    - C: By showing how nails and claws have evolved to meet specific needs\n    - D: By demonstrating the irrelevance of nails and claws in animal adaptations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a key advantage of nails over claws in certain environments?\n    - A: Nails are sharper and more deadly\n    - B: Nails are more versatile and can be used for a variety of tasks\n    - C: Nails provide better grip and sensitivity in arboreal environments\n    - D: Nails are stronger and more durable\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a key disadvantage of claws in certain environments?\n    - A: Claws are too sharp and can cause injury\n    - B: Claws are too heavy and can weigh down the animal\n    - C: Claws can interfere with tasks that require dexterity and precision\n    - D: Claws are too brittle and can break easily\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI have made some minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and conciseness. I have also ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and that the correct answers are accurate. No major changes were necessary, and the questions are now refined and ready for use."
