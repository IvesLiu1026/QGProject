What could be a potential way to mitigate these side effects?\n    - A: Increasing the dosage of chemotherapy\n    - B: Using a wig and taking regular breaks to rest\n    - C: Switching to a different type of cancer treatment\n    - D: Stopping chemotherapy altogether\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Researchers are developing more precise interventions in chemotherapy. How could this be applied to other areas of medicine?\n    - A: By developing more precise interventions in radiation therapy\n    - B: By developing more precise interventions in surgery\n    - C: By developing more precise interventions in gene editing\n    - D: By developing more precise interventions in all of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect connections)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between mustard gas and chemotherapy?\n    - A: Mustard gas was used to treat cancer, leading to the development of chemotherapy\n    - B: Mustard gas was used during World War I, and its effects on bone marrow led to the development of chemotherapy\n    - C: Mustard gas was used to treat other diseases, leading to the development of chemotherapy\n    - D: Mustard gas was not related to the development of chemotherapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection between chemotherapy's impact on rapidly-dividing cells and its side effects?\n    - A: Chemotherapy's impact on rapidly-dividing cells has no side effects\n    - B: Chemotherapy's impact on rapidly-dividing cells leads to side effects on healthy cells\n    - C: Chemotherapy's impact on slowly-dividing cells leads to side effects\n    - D: Chemotherapy's impact on non-dividing cells leads to side effects\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How could the concept of chemotherapy be combined with other treatments to create more effective cancer treatments?\n    - A: By combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy\n    - B: By combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy\n    - C: By combining chemotherapy with targeted therapy\n    - D: By combining chemotherapy with all of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What are some potential ways to use the principles of chemotherapy to develop new treatments for other diseases?\n    - A: By targeting rapidly-dividing cells in other diseases\n    - B: By targeting slowly-dividing cells in other diseases\n    - C: By targeting non-dividing cells in other diseases\n    - D: By not using the principles of chemotherapy at all\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) Is the use of chemotherapy justified given its side effects on healthy cells?\n    - A: Yes, because the benefits of chemotherapy outweigh its side effects\n    - B: No, because the side effects of chemotherapy outweigh its benefits\n    - C: Maybe, because it depends on individual cases\n    - D: Not enough information to make a judgment\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) How can the benefits and drawbacks of chemotherapy be weighed in individual cases?\n    - A: By considering only the benefits of chemotherapy\n    - B: By considering only the drawbacks of chemotherapy\n    - C: By considering both the benefits and drawbacks of chemotherapy and weighing them against individual circumstances\n    - D: By not considering the benefits and drawbacks of chemotherapy at all\n[Correct answer]: C"
