    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) What is the plica semilunaris in humans?\n    - A: A fully functional third eyelid\n    - B: A remnant of a third eyelid\n    - C: A part of the intestinal system\n    - D: A type of muscle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of people have a vestigial muscle called the palmaris longus?\n    - A: Up to 20%\n    - B: Up to 50%\n    - C: Up to 85%\n    - D: Up to 100%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) Why do vestigial structures persist in a species?\n    - A: Because they are actively beneficial\n    - B: Because they are not actively harmful\n    - C: Because they are essential for survival\n    - D: Because they are inherited from parents\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What happens to traits that are no longer beneficial due to natural selection?\n    - A: They become more prominent\n    - B: They remain unchanged\n    - C: They gradually disappear\n    - D: They become vestigial immediately\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application**\n\n1) How can understanding vestigial structures help us?\n    - A: Appreciate the complexity of the human body\n    - B: Appreciate the evolutionary history of the human body\n    - C: Diagnose and treat medical conditions unrelated to vestigial structures\n    - D: Understand the function of all human organs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How can recognizing vestigial structures inform medical diagnoses and treatments?\n    - A: By ignoring their presence\n    - B: By considering their original function\n    - C: By understanding their current function\n    - D: By removing them surgically\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What can be inferred from the comparison between the plica semilunaris in birds and mammals and its vestigial state in humans?\n    - A: That the plica semilunaris is essential for human survival\n    - B: That the plica semilunaris has the same function in all species\n    - C: That the plica semilunaris has evolved differently in different species\n    - D: That the plica semilunaris is not a vestigial structure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the relationship between the tailbone's original function and its current role?\n    - A: The tailbone's original function is the same as its current role\n    - B: The tailbone's original function is unrelated to its current role\n    - C: The tailbone's original function has evolved into its current role\n    - D: The tailbone's original function is unknown\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) What can be inferred by combining knowledge of vestigial structures with an understanding of natural selection?\n    - A: That vestigial structures are essential for human survival\n    - B: That natural selection is the only factor in evolution\n    - C: That vestigial structures provide insights into the evolution of the human body\n    - D: That natural selection is not relevant to vestigial structures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What can be hypothesized about the original function of the palmaris longus muscle by integrating information about its presence in primate relatives?\n    - A: That it was used for grasping and climbing\n    - B: That it was used for running and jumping\n    - C: That it was used for digestion and absorption\n    - D: That it was used for respiration and circulation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) What is the significance of vestigial structures in understanding human evolution?\n    - A: They provide no insights into human evolution\n    - B: They provide some insights into human evolution\n    - C: They provide significant insights into human evolution\n    - D: They are the only source of information about human evolution\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What can be said about the idea that the appendix is a useless vestige?\n    - A: It is widely accepted by scientists\n    - B: It is a topic of ongoing debate among scientists\n    - C: It is completely false and has no basis in evidence\n    - D: It is the only explanation for the appendix's persistence\n[Correct answer]: B"
