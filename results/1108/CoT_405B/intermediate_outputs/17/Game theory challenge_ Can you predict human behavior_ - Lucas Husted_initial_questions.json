A: An average of roughly 50 with 1,000 readers participating.\n    - B: An average of roughly 22 with over 19,000 readers participating.\n    - C: An average of roughly 80 with 5,000 readers participating.\n    - D: An average of roughly 10 with 10,000 readers participating.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What is the purpose of the game in terms of decision-making?\n    - A: To test how people think about probability and chance.\n    - B: To test how people think about other people's thinking, and how this affects their decision-making.\n    - C: To test how people think about economic theories and models.\n    - D: To test how people think about statistical analysis and data interpretation.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the Nash Equilibrium in the context of the game?\n    - A: A state where every player has chosen a random strategy.\n    - B: A state where every player has chosen the best possible strategy for themselves given everyone else playing.\n    - C: A state where every player has chosen a strategy based on probability.\n    - D: A state where every player has chosen a strategy based on intuition.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-World Scenarios)**\n\n1) How do stock traders use k-level thinking in their decision-making?\n    - A: By evaluating stocks based on historical trends and patterns.\n    - B: By evaluating stocks based on earnings reports and the value that others place on those numbers.\n    - C: By evaluating stocks based on technical analysis and chart patterns.\n    - D: By evaluating stocks based on fundamental analysis and financial statements.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) In what way do penalty shooters and goalies in soccer use k-level thinking?\n    - A: By deciding whether to go right or left based on probability and chance.\n    - B: By deciding whether to go right or left based on what they think the other person is thinking.\n    - C: By deciding whether to go right or left based on their own intuition and instinct.\n    - D: By deciding whether to go right or left based on the other team's strategy and formation.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and Contrasts)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the average guess and the correct answer in the game?\n    - A: Direct, meaning that as the average increases, the correct answer also increases.\n    - B: Inverse, meaning that as the average increases, the correct answer decreases.\n    - C: Linear, meaning that the average and correct answer are directly proportional.\n    - D: Non-linear, meaning that the average and correct answer are not directly proportional.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What does the contrast between the most logical approach and the most common approach in the game highlight?\n    - A: The difference between rationality and emotion.\n    - B: The difference between rationality and practicality.\n    - C: The difference between logic and intuition.\n    - D: The difference between theory and practice.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1) What can be gained by combining the concept of common knowledge with k-level thinking?\n    - A: Insights into how people think about probability and chance.\n    - B: Insights into how people think about other people's thinking and how this affects their decision-making.\n    - C: Insights into how people think about economic theories and models.\n    - D: Insights into how people think about statistical analysis and data interpretation.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What can be explained by integrating the idea of Nash Equilibrium with k-level thinking?\n    - A: Why people tend to converge on certain strategies in situations where they need to consider other people's thinking.\n    - B: Why people tend to diverge from certain strategies in situations where they need to consider other people's thinking.\n    - C: Why people tend to choose random strategies in situations where they need to consider other people's thinking.\n    - D: Why people tend to choose intuitive strategies in situations where they need to consider other people's thinking.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and Critique)**\n\n1) What is necessary to justify the use of k-level thinking in high-stakes situations?\n    - A: Considering the potential benefits and limitations of this approach.\n    - B: Ignoring the potential benefits and limitations of this approach.\n    - C: Focusing solely on the potential benefits of this approach.\n    - D: Focusing solely on the potential limitations of this approach.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What can be gained by critiquing the assumption that people are perfectly rational or expect each other to be?\n    - A: A better understanding of how people make decisions in hypothetical situations.\n    - B: A better understanding of how people make decisions in real-world situations.\n    - C: A better understanding of how people think about probability and chance.\n    - D: A better understanding of how people think about economic theories and models.\n[Correct answer]: B"
