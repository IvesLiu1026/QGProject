    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level based on the content analysis provided:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) Who developed the keratomileusis procedure in 1948?\n    - A: Jose Ignacio Barraquer Moner\n    - B: Svyatoslav Fyodorov\n    - C: Ioannis Pallikaris\n    - D: Stephen Slade\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What type of laser is used in LASIK surgery to sculpt the cornea?\n    - A: Excimer laser\n    - B: Femtosecond laser\n    - C: Nd:YAG laser\n    - D: Argon laser\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What is the primary purpose of the keratomileusis procedure?\n    - A: To correct cataracts\n    - B: To correct refractive errors by reshaping the cornea\n    - C: To correct glaucoma\n    - D: To correct age-related macular degeneration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How does the excimer laser work in LASIK surgery?\n    - A: It uses a technique called photoablation to evaporate organic tissue without overheating surrounding eye tissue\n    - B: It uses a technique called photocoagulation to heat up surrounding eye tissue\n    - C: It uses a technique called photodisruption to disrupt surrounding eye tissue\n    - D: It uses a technique called photorefractive keratectomy to reshape the cornea\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) A person with myopia (short-sightedness) is considering corrective eye surgery. Which procedure would be most suitable for them?\n    - A: LASIK surgery\n    - B: Cataract surgery\n    - C: Glaucoma surgery\n    - D: Corneal transplant surgery\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) A person with presbyopia (aging eyes) is considering corrective eye surgery. Which procedure would be most suitable for them?\n    - A: LASIK surgery\n    - B: Laser Blended Vision surgery\n    - C: Cataract surgery\n    - D: Corneal transplant surgery\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and contrasts)**\n\n1) What is the main difference between the keratomileusis procedure and LASIK surgery?\n    - A: The keratomileusis procedure uses a miniature lathe, while LASIK surgery uses an excimer laser\n    - B: The keratomileusis procedure is used to correct cataracts, while LASIK surgery is used to correct refractive errors\n    - C: The keratomileusis procedure is more accurate and safer than LASIK surgery\n    - D: The keratomileusis procedure is less expensive than LASIK surgery\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the main advantage of the SMILE technique over traditional LASIK surgery?\n    - A: It is more accurate and safer\n    - B: It is less expensive\n    - C: It reduces recovery time\n    - D: It is more suitable for people with presbyopia\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) What is the potential benefit of combining LASIK surgery with Laser Blended Vision surgery?\n    - A: It could potentially restore perfect vision in people with presbyopia and other refractive errors\n    - B: It could potentially reduce recovery time for patients undergoing LASIK surgery\n    - C: It could potentially improve the accuracy and safety of LASIK surgery\n    - D: It could potentially reduce the cost of LASIK surgery\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the potential benefit of using advanced technologies, such as excimer lasers, in LASIK surgery?\n    - A: It could potentially improve the accuracy and safety of LASIK surgery\n    - B: It could potentially reduce recovery time for patients undergoing LASIK surgery\n    - C: It could potentially reduce the cost of LASIK surgery\n    - D: It could potentially make LASIK surgery more suitable for people with presbyopia\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n1) What should be carefully weighed before undergoing LASIK surgery?\n    - A: The risks and benefits of the procedure\n    - B: The cost of the procedure\n    - C: The recovery time for the procedure\n    - D: The suitability of the procedure for people with presbyopia\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What should be critically evaluated to ensure the safety and effectiveness of LASIK surgery?\n    - A: The use of excimer lasers and other advanced technologies\n    - B: The qualifications and experience of the surgeon\n    - C: The suitability of the procedure for people with presbyopia\n    - D: The cost of the procedure\n[Correct answer]: A"
