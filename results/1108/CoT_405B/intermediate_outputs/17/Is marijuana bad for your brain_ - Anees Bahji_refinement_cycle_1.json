    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In what year was marijuana classified as a Schedule 1 drug in the United States?\n    - A: 1960\n    - B: 1970\n    - C: 1980\n    - D: 1990\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What are the two main active compounds found in marijuana?\n    - A: THC and CBN\n    - B: CBD and CBG\n    - C: THC and CBD\n    - D: CBN and CBG\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the primary function of the endocannabinoid system in the brain and body?\n    - A: To produce psychoactive effects\n    - B: To modulate other signals in the brain and body\n    - C: To regulate the immune system\n    - D: To produce hormones\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make distractors more plausible.\n\n4) Why do the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person?\n    - A: Due to individual differences in brain chemistry, genetics, and life experience\n    - B: Due to the potency of the marijuana\n    - C: Due to the method of consumption\n    - D: Due to the age of the user alone\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make distractors more specific and plausible.\n\n5) What could be a potential benefit of understanding the mechanisms of the endocannabinoid system?\n    - A: The development of new recreational marijuana products\n    - B: The development of new treatments for various conditions\n    - C: The reduction of marijuana use among young people\n    - D: The identification of new risk factors for marijuana-induced psychosis\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make distractors more plausible and relevant to the topic.\n\n6) How could recognizing the risk factors for marijuana-induced psychosis be useful for healthcare professionals?\n    - A: It could help them identify individuals who may be more susceptible to this condition\n    - B: It could help them develop new treatments for the condition\n    - C: It could help them reduce the risk of negative effects from marijuana use\n    - D: It could help them predict the likelihood of psychosis in individuals with a family history\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make distractors more specific and plausible.\n\n7) What is the relationship between the endocannabinoid system and other systems in the body?\n    - A: Simple and well understood\n    - B: Complex and not fully understood\n    - C: Non-existent\n    - D: Only related to the nervous system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What influences the risk of negative effects from marijuana use?\n    - A: Only genetic factors\n    - B: Only environmental factors\n    - C: A combination of genetic, environmental, and individual factors\n    - D: Only the potency of the marijuana\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What could be a potential outcome of combining knowledge of the endocannabinoid system with an understanding of individual differences in brain chemistry and genetics?\n    - A: The development of more effective treatments for various conditions\n    - B: The reduction of marijuana use among young people\n    - C: The increase of marijuana-induced psychosis cases\n    - D: The development of new diagnostic tools for marijuana-related disorders\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make distractors more plausible and relevant to the topic.\n\n10) What could be a potential benefit of integrating research on the effects of marijuana with studies on brain development and psychotic disorders?\n    - A: The development of new treatments for various conditions\n    - B: The reduction of marijuana use among young people\n    - C: The increase of marijuana-induced psychosis cases\n    - D: The provision of new insights into the complex relationships between these factors\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What was a potential consequence of the classification of marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug?\n    - A: It facilitated research on its mechanisms and effects\n    - B: It hindered research on its mechanisms and effects\n    - C: It had no impact on research\n    - D: It increased awareness about the benefits of marijuana use\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of policies and education programs aimed at preventing or reducing marijuana use among young people?\n    - A: Only the reduction of marijuana use\n    - B: Only the increase of awareness about the risks of marijuana use\n    - C: The complex relationships between individual differences, environmental factors, and the effects of marijuana use\n    - D: Only the cost-effectiveness of the programs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make distractors more specific and plausible."
