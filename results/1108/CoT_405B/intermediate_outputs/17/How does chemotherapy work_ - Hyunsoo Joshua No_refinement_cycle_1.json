    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What poisonous gas used during World War I led to the development of chemotherapy?\n    - A: Mustard gas\n    - B: Chlorine gas\n    - C: Phosgene gas\n    - D: Cyanide gas\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) According to the transcript, approximately how many people worldwide received a cancer diagnosis in 2018?\n    - A: Over 10 million\n    - B: Over 12 million\n    - C: Over 15 million\n    - D: Over 17 million\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) How does chemotherapy target cancer cells?\n    - A: By targeting slowly-dividing cells\n    - B: By targeting rapidly-dividing cells\n    - C: By targeting non-dividing cells\n    - D: By targeting all cells equally\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why do chemotherapy drugs have side effects on healthy cells?\n    - A: Because they target only cancer cells\n    - B: Because they target rapidly-dividing cells, including healthy ones\n    - C: Because they target non-dividing cells\n    - D: Because they target all cells equally\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A patient is experiencing hair loss and fatigue due to chemotherapy. What could be a potential way to mitigate these side effects?\n    - A: Increasing the dosage of chemotherapy\n    - B: Using a wig, taking regular breaks to rest, and using cold caps to reduce hair loss\n    - C: Switching to a different type of cancer treatment\n    - D: Stopping chemotherapy altogether\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential benefit of developing more precise interventions in chemotherapy?\n    - A: Reduced harm to healthy tissues\n    - B: Increased harm to healthy tissues\n    - C: No impact on healthy tissues\n    - D: Reduced effectiveness against cancer cells\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between mustard gas and chemotherapy?\n    - A: Mustard gas was used to treat cancer, leading to the development of chemotherapy\n    - B: Mustard gas was used during World War I, and its effects on bone marrow led to the development of chemotherapy\n    - C: Mustard gas was used to treat other diseases, leading to the development of chemotherapy\n    - D: Mustard gas was not related to the development of chemotherapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between chemotherapy's impact on rapidly-dividing cells and its side effects?\n    - A: Chemotherapy's impact on rapidly-dividing cells has no side effects\n    - B: Chemotherapy's impact on rapidly-dividing cells leads to side effects on healthy cells\n    - C: Chemotherapy's impact on slowly-dividing cells leads to side effects\n    - D: Chemotherapy's impact on non-dividing cells leads to side effects\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How could the concept of chemotherapy be combined with other treatments to create more effective cancer treatments?\n    - A: By combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy\n    - B: By combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy\n    - C: By combining chemotherapy with targeted therapy\n    - D: By combining chemotherapy with one or more of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What are some potential ways to use the principles of chemotherapy to develop new treatments for other diseases?\n    - A: By targeting rapidly-dividing cells in other diseases\n    - B: By targeting slowly-dividing cells in other diseases\n    - C: By targeting non-dividing cells in other diseases\n    - D: By not using the principles of chemotherapy at all\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) Is the use of chemotherapy justified given its side effects on healthy cells?\n    - A: Yes, because the benefits of chemotherapy outweigh its side effects\n    - B: No, because the side effects of chemotherapy outweigh its benefits\n    - C: Maybe, because it depends on individual cases\n    - D: Not enough information to make a judgment\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) How can the benefits and drawbacks of chemotherapy be weighed in individual cases?\n    - A: By considering only the benefits of chemotherapy\n    - B: By considering only the drawbacks of chemotherapy\n    - C: By considering both the benefits and drawbacks of chemotherapy and weighing them against individual circumstances\n    - D: By not considering the benefits and drawbacks of chemotherapy at all\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12."
