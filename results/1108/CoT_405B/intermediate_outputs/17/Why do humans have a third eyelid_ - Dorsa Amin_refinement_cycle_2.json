    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the current function of the plica semilunaris in humans?\n    - A: To keep dust and debris out of the eyes\n    - B: To aid in digestion\n    - C: To regulate body temperature\n    - D: It is vestigial, meaning it no longer serves its original purpose\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What percentage of people have a vestigial muscle called the palmaris longus?\n    - A: Up to 20%\n    - B: Up to 50%\n    - C: Up to 85%\n    - D: Up to 100%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why do vestigial structures persist in a species?\n    - A: Because they provide a significant advantage\n    - B: Because they are not actively harmful\n    - C: Because they are essential for survival\n    - D: Because they are inherited from parents\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to traits that are no longer beneficial due to natural selection?\n    - A: They become more prominent\n    - B: They remain unchanged\n    - C: They gradually disappear\n    - D: They become vestigial immediately\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What can be learned from studying vestigial structures?\n    - A: The complexity of the human body\n    - B: The evolutionary history of the human body\n    - C: The function of all human organs\n    - D: The importance of removing vestigial structures surgically\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How can recognizing vestigial structures inform our understanding of human evolution?\n    - A: By ignoring their presence\n    - B: By considering their original function\n    - C: By understanding their current function\n    - D: By assuming they have no significance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What can be inferred from the comparison between the plica semilunaris in birds and mammals and its vestigial state in humans?\n    - A: That the plica semilunaris is essential for human survival\n    - B: That the plica semilunaris has the same function in all species\n    - C: That the plica semilunaris has evolved differently in different species\n    - D: That the plica semilunaris is not a vestigial structure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the relationship between the tailbone's original function and its current role?\n    - A: The tailbone's original function is the same as its current role\n    - B: The tailbone's original function is unrelated to its current role\n    - C: The tailbone's original function has evolved into its current role\n    - D: The tailbone's original function is unknown\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be inferred by combining knowledge of vestigial structures with an understanding of natural selection?\n    - A: That vestigial structures are essential for human survival\n    - B: That natural selection is the only factor in evolution\n    - C: That vestigial structures provide insights into the evolution of the human body\n    - D: That natural selection is not relevant to vestigial structures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can be hypothesized about the original function of the palmaris longus muscle by integrating information about its presence in primate relatives?\n    - A: That it was used for grasping and climbing\n    - B: That it was used for running and jumping\n    - C: That it was used for digestion and absorption\n    - D: That it was used for respiration and circulation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is the significance of vestigial structures in understanding human evolution?\n    - A: They provide no insights into human evolution\n    - B: They provide some insights into human evolution\n    - C: They provide significant insights into human evolution\n    - D: They are the only source of information about human evolution\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What can be said about the idea that the appendix is a useless vestige?\n    - A: It is widely accepted by scientists\n    - B: It is a topic of ongoing debate among scientists\n    - C: It is completely false and has no basis in evidence\n    - D: It is the only explanation for the appendix's persistence\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
