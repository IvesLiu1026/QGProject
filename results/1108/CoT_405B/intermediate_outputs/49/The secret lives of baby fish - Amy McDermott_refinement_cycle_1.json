    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure alignment with the key concepts, enhance clarity and conciseness, and confirm distractors are plausible but incorrect. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the Earth's surface is covered by coral reefs?\n    - A: Less than 1%\n    - B: Around 5%\n    - C: Approximately 10%\n    - D: More than 20%\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) How long can larvae of coral reef fish float in the water column?\n    - A: Only a few seconds\n    - B: Minutes to months\n    - C: Several years\n    - D: Indefinitely\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the primary challenge faced by coral reef fish as they grow up?\n    - A: Finding food in the water column\n    - B: Avoiding predators in the reef\n    - C: Undergoing drastic changes and navigating to find a suitable adult habitat\n    - D: Competing with other fish for mating rights\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What sensory systems do larvae of coral reef fish use to navigate and find their preferred adult habitats?\n    - A: Only sound\n    - B: Only smell\n    - C: A complex suite of sensory systems, including sound and smell\n    - D: No sensory systems at all\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) Question removed as it is not directly supported by the transcript.\n\n6) What can understanding the life cycle and navigation abilities of coral reef fish inform?\n    - A: Policy decisions related to agriculture\n    - B: Conservation efforts and the management of marine ecosystems\n    - C: The development of new fishing gear\n    - D: The study of terrestrial ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) Question removed as it is not directly supported by the transcript.\n\n8) What is the contrast between the previous understanding of larval fish and the new research?\n    - A: The previous understanding was that larval fish were active navigators, while the new research suggests they are passive drifters\n    - B: The previous understanding was that larval fish were passive drifters, while the new research suggests they are capable of taking control of their fate\n    - C: The previous understanding was that larval fish were only found in coral reefs, while the new research suggests they are found in all ocean habitats\n    - D: The previous understanding was that larval fish were only active at night, while the new research suggests they are active during the day\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) Question removed as it is not directly supported by the transcript.\n\n10) Question removed as it is not directly supported by the transcript.\n\n11) Question removed as it is not directly supported by the transcript.\n\n12) What is the importance of continued research into the life cycles and navigation abilities of coral reef fish?\n    - A: It is not important at all\n    - B: It is only somewhat important\n    - C: It is very important to inform management and conservation decisions\n    - D: It is only important for understanding terrestrial ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to:\n12) Why is continued research into the life cycles and navigation abilities of coral reef fish crucial?\n    - A: To inform agricultural practices\n    - B: To develop new fishing gear\n    - C: To inform management and conservation decisions\n    - D: To study terrestrial ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNew questions added to replace removed ones:\n\n13) What happens to the fertilized eggs of coral reef fish after they are released into the water column?\n    - A: They immediately settle on a reef\n    - B: They drift with the currents\n    - C: They are eaten by predators\n    - D: They hatch into adult fish\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n14) How do larvae of coral reef fish use their swimming abilities to navigate?\n    - A: They swim randomly in the water column\n    - B: They swim vertically to place themselves in different water masses\n    - C: They swim horizontally to reach a specific reef\n    - D: They do not swim at all\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n15) What is the \"bungee system\" used by larvae of coral reef fish to settle on a reef?\n    - A: They drop down to the reef and settle immediately\n    - B: They drop down to check out a reef and then jump back up if conditions are not right\n    - C: They swim around the reef to find the best spot to settle\n    - D: They use a complex system of sounds and smells to navigate\n[Correct answer]: B"
