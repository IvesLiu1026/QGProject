    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In which century did the Black Death occur, resulting in the deaths of nearly 50% of Europeans?\n    - A: 12th century\n    - B: 13th century\n    - C: 14th century\n    - D: 15th century\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What percentage of Europeans were killed by the Black Death in just four years?\n    - A: 20%\n    - B: 30%\n    - C: 40%\n    - D: Nearly 50%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) According to genetic comparisons of ancient and modern strains of Yersinia pestis, what was the primary factor that contributed to the deadliness of the medieval Black Death?\n    - A: The pathogen itself had significantly functional genetic differences\n    - B: Host (human) factors, such as malnutrition and prior illness\n    - C: Environmental factors, such as climate change\n    - D: Economic factors, such as trade and commerce\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What was the result of the rapid population growth in Europe during the High Middle Ages, combined with reduced harvests?\n    - A: Improved living standards and increased social mobility\n    - B: No significant impact on living standards\n    - C: A decline in living standards, making people more vulnerable to infection\n    - D: Increased economic growth and trade\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What can the study of the Black Death inform, given its significant impact on European society and the potential for future epidemics?\n    - A: Strategies for preventing and responding to future economic crises\n    - B: Strategies for preventing and responding to future epidemics\n    - C: Strategies for promoting population growth\n    - D: Strategies for mitigating climate change\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What could research on the genetic consequences of the Black Death lead to?\n    - A: Discoveries of new immunities and treatments for diseases\n    - B: A better understanding of the historical context of the Black Death\n    - C: Improved economic conditions in Europe\n    - D: Increased social mobility\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How did the end of the warm period in Europe during the 14th century affect harvests, famine, and poverty?\n    - A: The end of the warm period led to improved harvests and economic growth\n    - B: The end of the warm period had no significant impact on harvests, famine, and poverty\n    - C: The end of the warm period led to reduced harvests, famine, and poverty\n    - D: The end of the warm period led to increased social mobility\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How did the spread of the medieval Black Death compare to modern instances of plague?\n    - A: The medieval Black Death spread more slowly than modern instances of plague\n    - B: The medieval Black Death spread at the same rate as modern instances of plague\n    - C: The medieval Black Death spread more quickly than modern instances of plague\n    - D: There is no comparison between the two\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be studied through the lens of the Black Death?\n    - A: The intersection of climate change, population growth, and disease transmission\n    - B: The impact of the Industrial Revolution on European society\n    - C: The role of human factors in disease transmission\n    - D: The genetic consequences of the plague\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can the combination of genetic research and historical analysis provide in understanding the Black Death?\n    - A: New insights into the causes and effects of the Black Death\n    - B: A better understanding of the historical context of the Black Death\n    - C: Improved economic conditions in Europe\n    - D: Increased social mobility\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What can be evaluated through the lens of the Black Death, considering its significance in shaping European society and the potential for future epidemics?\n    - A: The significance of the Industrial Revolution in shaping European society\n    - B: The effectiveness of modern strategies for preventing and responding to pandemics\n    - C: The impact of climate change on disease transmission and population growth\n    - D: The justification for continued research on the genetic consequences of the plague\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What can be critiqued in light of the lessons learned from the Black Death?\n    - A: The effectiveness of modern strategies for preventing and responding to pandemics\n    - B: The historical context of the Black Death\n    - C: The genetic consequences of the plague\n    - D: The impact of climate change on disease transmission and population growth\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-12."
