    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What was the primary reason for Dr. Scoville's surgery on H.M.'s brain?\n    - A: To cure his seizures by removing the hippocampus\n    - B: To treat his mental illness by performing a full lobotomy\n    - C: To improve his memory by removing the basal ganglia\n    - D: To reduce his seizures by removing the cerebellum\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What significant consequence did H.M. experience after the surgery?\n    - A: Increased frequency of seizures\n    - B: Significant improvement in memory\n    - C: Loss of ability to form new memories\n    - D: Drastic change in personality\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What did Brenda Milner's research on H.M. reveal about memory?\n    - A: Memory is a single, unified process\n    - B: Memory is only stored in the hippocampus\n    - C: There are different types of memory, including short-term and long-term memory\n    - D: Memory is only stored in the cortex\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) According to the transcript, what is the role of the hippocampus in memory formation?\n    - A: To store memories permanently in the hippocampus\n    - B: To process sensory data from the environment\n    - C: To strengthen cortical synaptic connections and transfer memories to the cortex for permanent storage\n    - D: To retrieve memories from long-term storage\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is the distinction between declarative memory and procedural memory?\n    - A: Declarative memory refers to skills and habits, while procedural memory refers to facts and knowledge\n    - B: Declarative memory refers to facts and knowledge, while procedural memory refers to skills and habits\n    - C: Declarative memory refers to conscious memory, while procedural memory refers to unconscious memory\n    - D: Declarative memory refers to short-term memory, while procedural memory refers to long-term memory\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What was the outcome of H.M.'s attempt to trace a star shape in a mirror-drawing task?\n    - A: He showed no improvement over repeated trials\n    - B: He showed significant improvement over repeated trials, despite having no memory of previous attempts\n    - C: He was only able to complete the task once\n    - D: He was unable to complete the task due to lack of fine motor skills\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What was the result of H.M.'s surgery on his seizures?\n    - A: Increased frequency of seizures\n    - B: No change in seizure frequency\n    - C: Significant reduction in seizure frequency\n    - D: Complete elimination of seizures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What was the significance of H.M.'s case in the study of memory?\n    - A: It provided the first evidence for the existence of short-term memory\n    - B: It demonstrated the importance of the hippocampus in memory formation\n    - C: It showed that memory is a single, unified process\n    - D: It provided the first evidence for the distinction between declarative and procedural memory\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 1, 2, 4, and 7 to enhance clarity and conciseness. I also rephrased some distractors to make them more plausible but incorrect. The correct answers remain the same. No more refinement needed."
