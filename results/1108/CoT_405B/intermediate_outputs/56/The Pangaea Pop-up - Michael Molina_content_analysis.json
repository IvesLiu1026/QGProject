The same plant and reptile fossils, like Mesosaurus, are found on the South American east coast and African west coast.\n3. The ground moves at a rate of about 10 cm/year due to plate tectonics.\n4. The top two layers of the Earth's mantle are the lithosphere and asthenosphere.\n5. The lithosphere includes the crust and uppermost mantle.\n6. The asthenosphere is the highly viscous but solid rock portion of the upper mantle, 80-200 km below the Earth's surface.\n7. There are seven primary tectonic plates that compose the shape of the planet.\n8. Tectonic plates are about 100 km thick and composed of one or two layers: continental crust and oceanic crust.\n9. The South American Plate is an example of a tectonic plate made of two crusts.\n10. The three types of plate interactions are divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. The proximity of South America and Africa in the past explains the similarity in fossils found on their coasts.\n2. Plate tectonics is the large-scale movement of Earth's continents, occurring within the top two layers of the Earth's mantle.\n3. The lithosphere is separated into tectonic plates that float on top of the asthenosphere.\n4. The speed and direction of tectonic plate movement depend on the temperature and pressure of the asthenosphere.\n5. The movement of tectonic plates results in the formation of mountains, earthquakes, and changes in shorelines.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. Understanding plate tectonics can help explain natural phenomena like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n2. Knowing the movement of tectonic plates can inform predictions about future geological events, such as the formation of new mountains or changes in coastlines.\n3. Studying plate tectonics can provide insights into the Earth's history, including the break-up of supercontinents and the formation of new oceans.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The relationship between the lithosphere and asthenosphere is crucial for understanding plate tectonics.\n2. The contrast between the brittle, stiff lithosphere and the heated, malleable asthenosphere allows for the independent movement of tectonic plates.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between plate movement and geological events, such as earthquakes and mountain formation, is a key aspect of plate tectonics.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. Combining knowledge of plate tectonics with geological data can provide new insights into the Earth's history and the processes that shape our planet.\n2. Integrating information about the movement of tectonic plates with data on climate change and sea-level rise can inform predictions about future coastal changes and natural hazards.\n3. Synthesizing data from multiple fields, including geology, geography, and physics, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex processes involved in plate tectonics.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. Evaluating the scientific theories behind plate tectonics, such as mantle convection and the influence of the Earth's rotation and gravitational pull, requires critical thinking and analysis of evidence.\n2. Assessing the impact of plate tectonics on human societies, including the effects of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, requires consideration of multiple perspectives and evaluation of evidence.\n3. Judging the accuracy of predictions about future geological events, such as the movement of tectonic plates and changes in coastlines, requires evaluation of the underlying assumptions and evidence."
