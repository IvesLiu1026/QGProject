    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. The periodic table is not complete, and new elements are being discovered/synthesized.\n2. Element 115 was first synthesized by a collaboration between The Institute in Dubna, Russia, and the Lawrence Livermore lab in the US.\n3. The method used to synthesize Element 115 involves accelerating a light element (calcium) to collide with a heavy element (americium).\n4. The synthesis of Element 115 has been repeated by a Swedish team led by Professor Dirk Rudolph.\n5. The International Union of Physics and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry have a joint committee that reviews evidence for new elements.\n6. The discoverers of a new element get to choose its name, subject to certain rules (e.g., it must be named after a deceased scientist).\n7. Element 114 is named Flerovium, and Element 116 is named Livermorium.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The process of synthesizing new elements involves accelerating particles to collide with existing elements, resulting in the formation of a new nucleus.\n2. The detection of new elements is often done by observing their nuclear decay patterns, which can involve the emission of alpha particles or gamma rays.\n3. The repetition of the original experiment by a different team increases the confidence in the existence of Element 115.\n4. The naming of new elements is a formal process that involves submitting evidence to a joint committee and following specific rules.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. The discovery of new elements can lead to a deeper understanding of the periodic table and the properties of elements.\n2. The synthesis of new elements can be used to create new materials with unique properties.\n3. The study of nuclear decay patterns can be applied to fields such as nuclear medicine and radiation detection.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. The relationship between the synthesis of new elements and the expansion of the periodic table.\n2. The contrast between the original experiment and the repeated experiment by the Swedish team.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the detection of gamma rays and the confirmation of Element 115's existence.\n4. The relationship between the naming of elements and the recognition of scientific contributions.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. The idea that the discovery of new elements can be a collaborative effort between different teams and countries.\n2. The concept that the naming of elements can be a way to celebrate scientific achievements and recognize the contributions of deceased scientists.\n3. The possibility that the study of new elements can lead to new insights into the structure of the periodic table and the properties of elements.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. The decision to name an element after a deceased scientist, and the criteria used to select the name.\n2. The evaluation of the evidence submitted to the joint committee to confirm the existence of Element 115.\n3. The justification for the rules governing the naming of elements, such as the requirement that the scientist be deceased.\n4. The critique of the suggestion to name an element after a living scientist, and the potential implications of such a decision."
