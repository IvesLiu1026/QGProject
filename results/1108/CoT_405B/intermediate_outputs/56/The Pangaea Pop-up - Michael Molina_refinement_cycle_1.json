    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many years ago did the supercontinent Pangaea begin to break apart?\n    - A: 100 million years\n    - B: 200 million years\n    - C: 300 million years\n    - D: 400 million years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the approximate rate at which the ground moves due to plate tectonics?\n    - A: 1 cm/year\n    - B: 5 cm/year\n    - C: 10 cm/year\n    - D: 20 cm/year\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary reason for the similarity in fossils found on the coasts of South America and Africa?\n    - A: The continents have similar climates\n    - B: The continents were once connected\n    - C: The continents have similar geography\n    - D: The continents were formed at the same time\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the relationship between the lithosphere and the asthenosphere?\n    - A: The lithosphere is below the asthenosphere\n    - B: The lithosphere is above the asthenosphere\n    - C: The lithosphere and asthenosphere are at the same level\n    - D: The lithosphere and asthenosphere are not related\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What type of plate boundary is characterized by two plates moving away from each other?\n    - A: Convergent boundary\n    - B: Divergent boundary\n    - C: Transform boundary\n    - D: Continental boundary\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can understanding plate tectonics help explain?\n    - A: Only earthquakes\n    - B: Only volcanic eruptions\n    - C: Both earthquakes and the formation of mountain ranges\n    - D: Neither earthquakes nor volcanic eruptions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is crucial for understanding plate tectonics?\n    - A: The relationship between the lithosphere and the atmosphere\n    - B: The relationship between the lithosphere and the asthenosphere\n    - C: The relationship between the asthenosphere and the mantle\n    - D: The relationship between the mantle and the core\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What allows for the independent movement of tectonic plates?\n    - A: The similarity in temperature and pressure between the lithosphere and asthenosphere\n    - B: The contrast in temperature and pressure between the lithosphere and asthenosphere\n    - C: The similarity in composition between the lithosphere and asthenosphere\n    - D: The contrast in composition between the lithosphere and asthenosphere\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can combining knowledge of plate tectonics with geological data provide?\n    - A: New insights into the Earth's climate\n    - B: New insights into the Earth's geography\n    - C: New insights into the Earth's history\n    - D: New insights into the Earth's mantle\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can understanding plate tectonics inform predictions about?\n    - A: Future weather patterns\n    - B: Future geological events, such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions\n    - C: Future climate change\n    - D: Future sea-level rise\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What requires critical thinking and analysis of evidence when evaluating the scientific theories behind plate tectonics?\n    - A: Only mantle convection\n    - B: Only the influence of the Earth's rotation and gravitational pull\n    - C: Both mantle convection and the influence of the Earth's rotation and gravitational pull\n    - D: Neither mantle convection nor the influence of the Earth's rotation and gravitational pull\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential consequence of the movement of tectonic plates?\n    - A: The formation of a single, large continent\n    - B: The creation of new oceans\n    - C: Changes in the Earth's coastlines and the formation of new mountain ranges\n    - D: The cessation of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made changes to questions 5, 6, 10, and 12 to improve clarity and accuracy. I also rephrased some of the options to make them more concise and plausible. Additionally, I removed question 13-24 from the initial set as they were not provided."
