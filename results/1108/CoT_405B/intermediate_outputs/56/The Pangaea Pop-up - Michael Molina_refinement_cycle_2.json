    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many years ago did the supercontinent Pangaea begin to break apart?\n    - A: 100 million years\n    - B: 200 million years\n    - C: 300 million years\n    - D: 400 million years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the approximate rate at which the ground moves due to plate tectonics?\n    - A: 1 cm/year\n    - B: 5 cm/year\n    - C: 10 cm/year\n    - D: 20 cm/year\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the primary reason for the similarity in fossils found on the coasts of South America and Africa?\n    - A: The continents have similar climates\n    - B: The continents were once connected\n    - C: The continents have similar geography\n    - D: The continents were formed at the same time\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is the relationship between the lithosphere and the asthenosphere?\n    - A: The lithosphere is below the asthenosphere\n    - B: The lithosphere is above the asthenosphere\n    - C: The lithosphere and asthenosphere are at the same level\n    - D: The lithosphere and asthenosphere are not related\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What type of plate boundary is characterized by two plates moving away from each other?\n    - A: Convergent boundary\n    - B: Divergent boundary\n    - C: Transform boundary\n    - D: Continental boundary\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What can understanding plate tectonics help explain?\n    - A: Only earthquakes\n    - B: Only volcanic eruptions\n    - C: Both earthquakes and the formation of mountain ranges\n    - D: The movement of the Earth's crust, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountain ranges\n[Correct answer]: D (Refined to include a broader range of phenomena)\n\n7) What is crucial for understanding plate tectonics?\n    - A: The relationship between the lithosphere and the atmosphere\n    - B: The relationship between the lithosphere and the asthenosphere\n    - C: The relationship between the asthenosphere and the mantle\n    - D: The relationship between the mantle and the core\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What allows for the independent movement of tectonic plates?\n    - A: The similarity in temperature and pressure between the lithosphere and asthenosphere\n    - B: The contrast in temperature and pressure between the lithosphere and asthenosphere\n    - C: The difference in viscosity between the lithosphere and asthenosphere\n    - D: The difference in composition between the lithosphere and asthenosphere\n[Correct answer]: C (Refined to focus on viscosity)\n\n9) What can combining knowledge of plate tectonics with geological data provide?\n    - A: New insights into the Earth's climate\n    - B: New insights into the Earth's geography\n    - C: New insights into the Earth's history\n    - D: New insights into the Earth's internal processes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What can understanding plate tectonics inform predictions about?\n    - A: Future weather patterns\n    - B: Future geological events, such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions\n    - C: Future climate change\n    - D: Future changes in the Earth's surface, including the movement of tectonic plates\n[Correct answer]: D (Refined to include a broader range of phenomena)\n\n11) What requires critical thinking and analysis of evidence when evaluating the scientific theories behind plate tectonics?\n    - A: Only mantle convection\n    - B: Only the influence of the Earth's rotation and gravitational pull\n    - C: Both mantle convection and the influence of the Earth's rotation and gravitational pull\n    - D: The interplay between multiple factors, including mantle convection, the Earth's rotation, and gravitational pull\n[Correct answer]: D (Refined to include a broader range of factors)\n\n12) What is a potential consequence of the movement of tectonic plates?\n    - A: The formation of a single, large continent\n    - B: The creation of new oceans\n    - C: Changes in the Earth's coastlines and the formation of new mountain ranges\n    - D: The reshaping of the Earth's surface, including changes in coastlines, mountain ranges, and ocean basins\n[Correct answer]: D (Refined to include a broader range of phenomena)"
