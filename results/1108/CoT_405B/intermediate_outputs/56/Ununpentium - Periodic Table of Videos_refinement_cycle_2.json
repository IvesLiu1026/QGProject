    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who collaborated to first synthesize Element 115?\n    - A: A team from The Institute in Dubna, Russia, and the Lawrence Livermore lab in the US\n    - B: A team from Sweden led by Professor Dirk Rudolph\n    - C: The International Union of Physics and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n    - D: A team from the German Institute GSI\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the name of Element 114?\n    - A: Livermorium\n    - B: Flerovium\n    - C: Americium\n    - D: Scandium\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the purpose of accelerating particles to collide with existing elements in the synthesis of new elements?\n    - A: To create a new compound\n    - B: To form a new nucleus\n    - C: To observe nuclear decay patterns\n    - D: To detect alpha particles\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the significance of repeating the original experiment by a different team in the discovery of Element 115?\n    - A: To disprove the existence of Element 115\n    - B: To create a new element\n    - C: To increase confidence in the existence of Element 115\n    - D: To detect gamma rays\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is the main way that the existence of new elements is confirmed?\n    - A: By detecting alpha particles\n    - B: By observing nuclear decay patterns\n    - C: By detecting gamma rays or X-rays\n    - D: By creating a new compound\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a possible outcome of discovering new elements?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the periodic table and the properties of elements\n    - B: The creation of a new compound\n    - C: The detection of gamma rays\n    - D: The repetition of the original experiment\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between the synthesis of new elements and the expansion of the periodic table?\n    - A: The synthesis of new elements leads to a reduction in the periodic table\n    - B: The synthesis of new elements has no impact on the periodic table\n    - C: The synthesis of new elements leads to an expansion of the periodic table\n    - D: The synthesis of new elements is unrelated to the periodic table\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the role of the International Union of Physics and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry in the discovery of new elements?\n    - A: To conduct experiments to synthesize new elements\n    - B: To review and verify the evidence for the existence of new elements\n    - C: To name new elements\n    - D: To create new compounds\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a criterion used to select the name of an element?\n    - A: The scientist must be living\n    - B: The scientist must be deceased\n    - C: The scientist must have made no significant contributions to the field\n    - D: The scientist must have made contributions to a different field\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a potential implication of naming an element after a living scientist?\n    - A: It would increase the recognition of scientific contributions\n    - B: It would decrease the recognition of scientific contributions\n    - C: It would have no impact on the recognition of scientific contributions\n    - D: It would be against the rules governing the naming of elements\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is the significance of the discovery of Element 115 being led by a Swedish team?\n    - A: It is the first time a Swedish team has led the discovery of a new element\n    - B: It highlights Sweden's contribution to the discovery of new elements\n    - C: It has no significance\n    - D: It is a coincidence\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the author's suggestion for the name of Element 115?\n    - A: Plankium\n    - B: Flerovium\n    - C: Livermorium\n    - D: Plum\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12."
