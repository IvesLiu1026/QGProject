Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) At what age did Dick Fosbury start focusing on the high jump?\n    - A: 14\n    - B: 16\n    - C: 18\n    - D: 20\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What was the Olympic record leap achieved by Fosbury at the 1968 Olympics?\n    - A: 2.20 meters\n    - B: 2.24 meters\n    - C: 2.28 meters\n    - D: 2.32 meters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why did Fosbury develop a new high jump method, which became known as the Fosbury Flop?\n    - A: He wanted to improve his speed.\n    - B: He was unable to compete using standard high jump techniques.\n    - C: He wanted to try a new approach for fun.\n    - D: He was trying to reduce his risk of injury.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How does the Fosbury Flop technique allow jumpers to clear higher bars?\n    - A: By applying more force than traditional techniques.\n    - B: By applying the same amount of force as traditional techniques, but using a more efficient technique.\n    - C: By using a shorter approach run.\n    - D: By using a longer approach run.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Which of the following sports can benefit from understanding the concept of center of mass?\n    - A: Basketball\n    - B: Gymnastics\n    - C: Football\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What is a real-world application of the concept of center of mass?\n    - A: Designing faster vehicles.\n    - B: Designing more stable structures or vehicles.\n    - C: Improving athletic footwear.\n    - D: Enhancing sports nutrition.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is crucial to understanding how the Fosbury Flop technique works?\n    - A: The relationship between the jumper's speed and the bar height.\n    - B: The relationship between the jumper's center of mass and the Fosbury Flop technique.\n    - C: The relationship between the jumper's strength and the bar height.\n    - D: The relationship between the jumper's flexibility and the bar height.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What highlights the innovation and effectiveness of Fosbury's method?\n    - A: The similarity between traditional high jump techniques and the Fosbury Flop.\n    - B: The contrast between traditional high jump techniques and the Fosbury Flop.\n    - C: The lack of success of traditional high jump techniques.\n    - D: The limited adoption of the Fosbury Flop technique.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can provide a deeper understanding of the Fosbury Flop technique?\n    - A: Combining the concept of center of mass with other physics principles, such as velocity and force.\n    - B: Focusing solely on the concept of center of mass.\n    - C: Ignoring the concept of center of mass.\n    - D: Analyzing the technique from a purely athletic perspective.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can lead to new insights and innovations in sports?\n    - A: Focusing on a single sport or activity.\n    - B: Integrating the idea of center of mass with other sports or activities.\n    - C: Ignoring the idea of center of mass.\n    - D: Limiting the application of physics principles to sports.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is required to judge the effectiveness of the Fosbury Flop technique compared to traditional high jump methods?\n    - A: An evaluation of the physics behind each approach.\n    - B: A comparison of the techniques' popularity.\n    - C: An assessment of the techniques' safety.\n    - D: A review of the techniques' historical development.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is necessary to justify the use of the Fosbury Flop technique in modern high jumping?\n    - A: An evaluation of its continued effectiveness and relevance.\n    - B: A consideration of its historical significance.\n    - C: An analysis of its aesthetic appeal.\n    - D: A review of its adoption by other sports.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nAfter refining the questions, I believe they meet the requirements and no further refinement is necessary.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
