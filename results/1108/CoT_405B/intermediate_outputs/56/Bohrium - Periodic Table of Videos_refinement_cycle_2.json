    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) Where was the element Bohrium first created?\n    - A: GSIB Institute in Darmstadt, Germany\n    - B: Carlsberg Brewery in Denmark\n    - C: Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen\n    - D: European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What method was used to create the element Bohrium?\n    - A: Accelerating ions of lead and another element to combine nuclei\n    - B: Fusing two lighter elements to form a heavier nucleus\n    - C: Irradiating a target material with high-energy particles\n    - D: Using chemical reactions to synthesize the element\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make option B more plausible but incorrect.\n\n3) Why did the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry initially reject the name \"Nielsbohrium\" for the element?\n    - A: It was too long\n    - B: It sounded similar to another element\n    - C: It used a Christian name, which was against convention\n    - D: It was not descriptive of the element's properties\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is unique about the naming of the salts of Bohrium?\n    - A: They are named after Niels Bohr\n    - B: They have a unique suffix\n    - C: They are called \"boriates\" instead of \"bohrates\" to avoid confusion with boron\n    - D: They are not officially recognized\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) According to the transcript, what is the shortest lifetime of a Bohrium isotope?\n    - A: 12 milliseconds\n    - B: 17 seconds\n    - C: 1 minute\n    - D: 1 hour\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What was Niels Bohr's prediction about the number of elements in the periodic table?\n    - A: There would be around 50 elements\n    - B: There would be around 100 elements\n    - C: There would be around 200 elements\n    - D: There would be an infinite number of elements\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) Why was chemistry possible with Bohrium despite its short lifetime?\n    - A: Its lifetime was longer than expected\n    - B: It reacted with oxygen and chlorine quickly\n    - C: Atoms with lifetimes shorter than 1 second can still undergo chemical reactions\n    - D: The experiments were conducted at extremely low temperatures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) (New question) How did the Carlsberg brewery honor Niels Bohr after he received the Nobel Prize?\n    - A: They named a beer after him\n    - B: They gave him a lifetime supply of beer\n    - C: They provided him with a house next to the brewery with a pipe for free beer\n    - D: They sponsored his research\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nAdded a new question to cover an interesting fact from the transcript."
