How is a new element created?\n    - A: By bombarding a light nucleus with a nucleus that has the desired atomic number\n    - B: By bombarding a heavy nucleus with a nucleus that has the desired atomic number\n    - C: By combining two or more elements to create a new one\n    - D: By splitting an existing element into two or more new elements\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. Why was the name Bohrium initially rejected by IUPAC?\n    - A: Because it was too long\n    - B: Because it was too short\n    - C: Because it included the scientist's first name\n    - D: Because it was already in use for another element\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. What is one implication of the creation of new elements like Bohrium?\n    - A: It has no impact on our understanding of the periodic table\n    - B: It only affects the chemistry of super-heavy elements\n    - C: It has implications for our understanding of the periodic table and the properties of elements\n    - D: It only affects the naming of elements\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What has the discovery of Bohrium led to?\n    - A: A decrease in research on the chemistry of super-heavy elements\n    - B: No change in research on the chemistry of super-heavy elements\n    - C: Further research on the chemistry of super-heavy elements\n    - D: A shift in focus to the chemistry of lighter elements\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect connections)**\n\n1. What is the relationship between the number of protons in an atom's nucleus and its stability?\n    - A: As the number of protons increases, the stability of the nucleus also increases\n    - B: As the number of protons increases, the stability of the nucleus decreases\n    - C: The number of protons has no effect on the stability of the nucleus\n    - D: The relationship is random and unpredictable\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. What does the contrast between the predicted and actual number of elements in the periodic table highlight?\n    - A: The accuracy of scientific predictions\n    - B: The ongoing nature of scientific discovery\n    - C: The limitations of scientific knowledge\n    - D: The importance of careful measurement\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas to form new understanding)**\n\n1. What has the discovery of Bohrium and other super-heavy elements led to?\n    - A: A greater understanding of the periodic table and the properties of elements\n    - B: A greater understanding of the chemistry of lighter elements\n    - C: A greater understanding of the fundamental nature of matter and the universe\n    - D: A and C\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2. What is involved in the naming of elements?\n    - A: Only scientific factors\n    - B: Only cultural and historical factors\n    - C: A combination of scientific, cultural, and historical factors\n    - D: No specific factors are involved\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. How can the decision to name the element Bohrium despite concerns about confusion with Boron be evaluated?\n    - A: In terms of its potential impact on scientific communication\n    - B: In terms of its potential impact on the periodic table\n    - C: In terms of its potential impact on the chemistry of super-heavy elements\n    - D: In terms of its potential impact on the naming of elements\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2. How can the prediction by Niels Bohr that there would be about 100 elements in the periodic table be evaluated?\n    - A: In terms of its accuracy and significance\n    - B: In terms of its impact on the naming of elements\n    - C: In terms of its impact on the chemistry of super-heavy elements\n    - D: In terms of its impact on the periodic table\n[Correct answer]: A"
