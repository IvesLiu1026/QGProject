    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure alignment with key concepts, clarity, conciseness, plausible distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the approximate melting point of indium?\n    - A: 100 degrees\n    - B: 150 degrees\n    - C: 200 degrees\n    - D: 250 degrees\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the purity of the indium sample shown in the video?\n    - A: 90%\n    - B: 95%\n    - C: 99%\n    - D: 99.9%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is a notable application of indium oxide, as mentioned in the video?\n    - A: Catalysis in chemical reactions\n    - B: Electronics in general\n    - C: LCD displays specifically\n    - D: Medical devices\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What properties of indium make it useful for specific applications?\n    - A: Hardness and brittleness\n    - B: Softness, malleability, and high density\n    - C: Conductivity and transparency\n    - D: Toxicity and reactivity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a common use of indium in the electronics industry, as mentioned in the video?\n    - A: As a conductor in general\n    - B: As a semiconductor in specific devices\n    - C: As a solder for joining metals\n    - D: As an insulator in certain applications\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a demonstrated use of indium oxide in device manufacturing?\n    - A: Producing LED lights\n    - B: Creating LCD displays\n    - C: Developing solar panels\n    - D: Manufacturing batteries\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is a likely cause of the increasing demand for indium oxide, as mentioned in the video?\n    - A: Growth of the LED light market\n    - B: Expansion of the solar panel industry\n    - C: Increase in the production of LCD displays\n    - D: Development of new battery technologies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a notable contrast in the physical properties of indium, as mentioned in the video?\n    - A: High density and high melting point\n    - B: Softness and high density\n    - C: Conductivity and transparency\n    - D: Toxicity and reactivity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a potential concern when handling indium, as mentioned in the video?\n    - A: High cost\n    - B: Limited availability\n    - C: Toxicity\n    - D: Reactivity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What should be considered when evaluating the use of indium oxide in LCD displays?\n    - A: Only its cost-effectiveness\n    - B: Only its environmental impact\n    - C: Both its cost-effectiveness and environmental impact\n    - D: Neither its cost-effectiveness nor environmental impact\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 from the initial set as they were redundant or not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript. I also rephrased question 9 to make it more concise and focused on the concern mentioned in the video.\n\nNo more refinement needed for the remaining questions."
