Dubnium is named after the Russian atomic research establishment, Dubna.\n2. Rutherfordium is named after Rutherford.\n3. Artificial elements can be named after famous people or places of discovery.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n1. The naming of artificial elements often follows specific conventions.\n2. When there's an argument about who discovered an element first, it's more equitable to name it after scientists.\n\n**Application**:\n1. The convention of naming elements after people or places can be applied to future discoveries of artificial elements.\n2. The decision to name an element after a scientist or a place can be used in real-world scenarios where multiple parties are involved in a discovery.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. The relationship between the discovery of an element and its naming convention.\n2. The contrast between naming elements after people versus places.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between disputes over discovery and the decision to name an element after a scientist.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n1. Combining the conventions of naming elements with the complexities of discovery disputes could lead to a deeper understanding of the politics and history behind element naming.\n2. Integrating the stories of famous scientists and their contributions to the discovery of elements could provide a richer understanding of the periodic table.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n1. Justifying the decision to name an element after a person versus a place.\n2. Critiquing the fairness of the current naming conventions for artificial elements.\n3. Evaluating the impact of discovery disputes on the naming of elements."
