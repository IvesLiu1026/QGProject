Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many years ago did the supercontinent Pangaea begin to break apart?\n    - A: 100 million years\n    - B: 200 million years\n    - C: 300 million years\n    - D: 400 million years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the approximate rate at which the ground moves due to plate tectonics?\n    - A: 1 cm/year\n    - B: 5 cm/year\n    - C: 10 cm/year\n    - D: 20 cm/year\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) Why do the coasts of South America and Africa have similar fossils?\n    - A: The continents have similar climates and geography\n    - B: The continents were once connected as part of a single supercontinent\n    - C: The continents were formed at the same time\n    - D: The continents have undergone similar geological processes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n4) What is the relationship between the lithosphere and the asthenosphere?\n    - A: The lithosphere is below the asthenosphere\n    - B: The lithosphere is above the asthenosphere\n    - C: The lithosphere and asthenosphere are at the same level\n    - D: The lithosphere is embedded within the asthenosphere\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the distractors more accurate.\n\n5) What type of plate boundary is characterized by two plates moving away from each other?\n    - A: Convergent boundary\n    - B: Divergent boundary\n    - C: Transform boundary\n    - D: Continental boundary\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What can understanding plate tectonics help explain?\n    - A: Only earthquakes and volcanic eruptions\n    - B: Only the formation of mountain ranges and ocean basins\n    - C: Both earthquakes and the formation of mountain ranges\n    - D: The movement of the Earth's crust, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountain ranges\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined to make the distractors more specific.\n\n7) What is crucial for understanding plate tectonics?\n    - A: The relationship between the lithosphere and the atmosphere\n    - B: The relationship between the lithosphere and the asthenosphere\n    - C: The relationship between the asthenosphere and the mantle\n    - D: The relationship between the mantle and the core\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What allows for the independent movement of tectonic plates?\n    - A: The similarity in temperature and pressure between the lithosphere and asthenosphere\n    - B: The difference in composition between the lithosphere and asthenosphere\n    - C: The difference in viscosity between the lithosphere and asthenosphere\n    - D: The interaction between the lithosphere and the Earth's core\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the distractors more accurate.\n\n9) What can combining knowledge of plate tectonics with geological data provide?\n    - A: New insights into the Earth's climate and geography\n    - B: New insights into the Earth's internal processes\n    - C: New insights into the Earth's history, including the movement of continents\n    - D: New insights into the Earth's natural resources\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the distractors more specific.\n\n10) What can understanding plate tectonics inform predictions about?\n    - A: Future weather patterns and climate change\n    - B: Future geological events, such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions\n    - C: Future changes in the Earth's surface, including the movement of tectonic plates\n    - D: Future changes in the Earth's magnetic field\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the distractors more specific.\n\n11) What requires critical thinking and analysis of evidence when evaluating the scientific theories behind plate tectonics?\n    - A: Only mantle convection\n    - B: Only the influence of the Earth's rotation and gravitational pull\n    - C: Both mantle convection and the influence of the Earth's rotation\n    - D: The interplay between multiple factors, including mantle convection, the Earth's rotation, and gravitational pull\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What is a potential consequence of the movement of tectonic plates?\n    - A: The formation of a single, large continent\n    - B: The creation of new oceans and the destruction of existing ones\n    - C: Changes in the Earth's coastlines and the formation of new mountain ranges\n    - D: The reshaping of the Earth's surface, including changes in coastlines, mountain ranges, and ocean basins\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed."
