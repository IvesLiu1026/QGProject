    "content_analysis": "Based on the provided transcript, here's the key information categorized under each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**:\n1. Promethium is a highly radioactive lanthanide.\n2. Promethium is the only radioactive rare earth element.\n3. Promethium is not found in nature due to its radioactive decay.\n4. Promethium was discovered after the start of nuclear research.\n5. Element 61 (promethium) was not known in 1922.\n6. Rhenium was discovered relatively recently compared to other elements.\n7. Aston discovered isotopes (atoms of the same element with different weights).\n\n**Comprehension**:\n1. The challenges of working with promethium due to its radioactivity and scarcity.\n2. The discovery of promethium in relation to nuclear research and the decay of other radioactive elements.\n3. The historical context of the discovery of elements, including the publication of Aston's chemistry book in 1922.\n\n**Application**:\n1. The use of promethium in nuclear research and its potential applications.\n2. The challenges of handling and storing radioactive elements like promethium in laboratory settings.\n3. The importance of Aston's discovery of isotopes in understanding the properties of elements.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. The relationship between promethium's radioactivity and its scarcity in nature.\n2. The comparison between the discovery of promethium and other elements, such as rhenium.\n3. The impact of nuclear research on the discovery of new elements.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n1. The potential connections between the discovery of promethium and other radioactive elements.\n2. The role of Aston's discovery of isotopes in advancing our understanding of the periodic table.\n3. The intersection of nuclear research and chemistry in the discovery of new elements.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n1. The significance of promethium's discovery in the context of nuclear research and the periodic table.\n2. The challenges and limitations of working with radioactive elements like promethium.\n3. The importance of Aston's contribution to the field of chemistry through his discovery of isotopes.\n\nThis analysis provides a foundation for creating assessment questions that target various cognitive levels, from recalling specific facts to evaluating the significance of the content."
