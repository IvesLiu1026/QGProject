What should they do?\n    - A: Reduce the amount of water used for irrigation\n    - B: Increase the amount of fertilizer used\n    - C: Use crop rotation techniques\n    - D: Implement integrated pest management\n[Correct answer]: C\nRefined option D to provide a more plausible distractor.\n\n7) What are the advantages and disadvantages of using renewable energy sources?\n    - A: Advantages: sustainable, reduces greenhouse gas emissions; Disadvantages: expensive, unreliable\n    - B: Advantages: cheap, reliable; Disadvantages: unsustainable, increases greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: Advantages: sustainable, reliable; Disadvantages: expensive, reduces greenhouse gas emissions\n    - D: Advantages: cheap, unsustainable; Disadvantages: reliable, increases greenhouse gas emissions\n[Correct answer]: A\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) Compare and contrast the characteristics of a hypothesis and a theory.\n    - A: A hypothesis is a proven explanation, while a theory is an educated guess\n    - B: A hypothesis is an educated guess, while a theory is a proven explanation\n    - C: A hypothesis is a statement of fact, while a theory is a statement of opinion\n    - D: A hypothesis is a tentative explanation, while a theory is a well-substantiated explanation\n[Correct answer]: B\nRefined option D to provide a more accurate description, but B remains the correct answer.\n\n9) How can we combine the principles of ecology and economics to create a more sustainable future?\n    - A: By prioritizing economic growth over environmental protection\n    - B: By implementing policies that promote sustainable development\n    - C: By relying solely on technological innovations to solve environmental problems\n    - D: By adopting a circular economy approach\n[Correct answer]: B\nRefined option D to provide a more plausible distractor.\n\n10) Design an experiment to test the effect of pH on plant growth.\n    - A: Measure the growth of plants in different temperatures\n    - B: Measure the growth of plants in different light conditions\n    - C: Measure the growth of plants in different pH levels\n    - D: Measure the growth of plants in different soil types with varying pH levels\n[Correct answer]: C\nRefined option D to make it more distinct from C.\n\n11) What are the ethical implications of using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture?\n    - A: GMOs are morally acceptable because they increase crop yields\n    - B: GMOs are morally unacceptable because they pose a risk to human health\n    - C: GMOs are morally acceptable because they reduce pesticide use\n    - D: GMOs are morally unacceptable because they may disrupt ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: B\nRefined option D to provide a more plausible distractor.\n\n12) Justify the use of nuclear power as a source of energy.\n    - A: Nuclear power is a renewable energy source\n    - B: Nuclear power is a clean and efficient source of energy\n    - C: Nuclear power is a cheap and reliable source of energy\n    - D: Nuclear power is a low-carbon energy source with proper waste management\n[Correct answer]: B\nRefined option D to provide a more accurate description, but B remains the correct answer."
