    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of cells does leukemia originate from?\n    - A: Mature red blood cells\n    - B: Stem cells found in the bone marrow\n    - C: White blood cells\n    - D: Platelets\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which type of cancer is most common in children?\n    - A: Brain cancer\n    - B: Leukemia\n    - C: Liver cancer\n    - D: Lymphoma\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why is cancer challenging to cure?\n    - A: It is a single illness with a straightforward treatment\n    - B: It is a family of over 100 diseases occurring in different types of cells\n    - C: It only affects children\n    - D: It only affects adults\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to the bone marrow's ability to produce functional cells in leukemia?\n    - A: It increases, leading to an overproduction of blood cells\n    - B: It remains the same, with no impact on blood cell production\n    - C: It becomes damaged, leading to a depletion of the blood\n    - D: It becomes more efficient, producing more blood cells\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is a potential benefit of understanding the causes and effects of leukemia?\n    - A: Developing new treatments for other types of cancer\n    - B: Improving the success rate of bone marrow transplants\n    - C: Developing new treatments for leukemia\n    - D: Increasing the chances of finding compatible donors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) Why is antigen compatibility important in bone marrow transplants?\n    - A: To reduce the risk of killing healthy cells\n    - B: To improve the success rate of bone marrow transplants\n    - C: To increase the chances of finding compatible donors\n    - D: To decrease the dosage of chemotherapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the bone marrow's inability to produce functional cells and the depletion of the blood?\n    - A: Cause-and-effect\n    - B: Contrast\n    - C: Similarity\n    - D: No relationship\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) How does the number of DNA modifications required for leukemia compare to other types of cancer?\n    - A: Leukemia requires more DNA modifications\n    - B: Leukemia requires fewer DNA modifications\n    - C: Leukemia requires the same number of DNA modifications\n    - D: There is no comparison\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a potential benefit of combining the understanding of stem cell biology and the causes of leukemia?\n    - A: Developing new treatments for other types of cancer\n    - B: Alternative treatments for chemotherapy\n    - C: Developing new treatments for leukemia\n    - D: Improved bone marrow transplants\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a benefit of integrating the knowledge of antigen compatibility and bone marrow transplants?\n    - A: Increasing the risk of killing healthy cells\n    - B: Improving the success rate of bone marrow transplants\n    - C: Reducing the chances of finding compatible donors\n    - D: Increasing the dosage of chemotherapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Why is expanding the database of voluntary bone marrow donors important?\n    - A: To increase the risk of killing healthy cells\n    - B: To reduce the chances of finding compatible donors\n    - C: To increase the chances of finding compatible donors\n    - D: To decrease the success rate of bone marrow transplants\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a limitation of bone marrow transplants?\n    - A: They are too expensive\n    - B: They are too time-consuming\n    - C: They require antigen compatibility between the donor and recipient\n    - D: They are too effective\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nThese refined questions should provide a more accurate assessment of the key concepts in the transcript."
