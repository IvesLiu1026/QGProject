    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the world's population is estimated to be left-handed?\n    - A: 5%\n    - B: 10%\n    - C: 15%\n    - D: 20%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) According to the \"tool sharing\" phenomenon, what percentage of top golfers are left-handed?\n    - A: 2%\n    - B: 4%\n    - C: 6%\n    - D: 8%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the current understanding of the origin of handedness?\n    - A: It is a learned trait through environment and upbringing.\n    - B: It is an inborn trait influenced by genetics and other factors.\n    - C: It is a random occurrence with no specific cause.\n    - D: It is a result of brain development after birth.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) According to the \"fighting hypothesis,\" what advantage do left-handed individuals have in competitive situations?\n    - A: They are stronger and more agile.\n    - B: They have an advantage due to their rarity, as opponents are less prepared to face them.\n    - C: They are equally matched with right-handed individuals.\n    - D: They are only advantageous in certain sports.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How might understanding the advantages of left-handedness in competitive sports inform a coach's strategy?\n    - A: By recruiting more right-handed players.\n    - B: By focusing on individual player skills rather than handedness.\n    - C: By recognizing the potential benefits of left-handed players in competitive situations.\n    - D: By ignoring handedness altogether.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What consideration should a designer take into account when creating a new tool for a predominantly right-handed society?\n    - A: The tool should only be designed for right-handed individuals.\n    - B: The tool should be designed with a bias towards left-handed individuals.\n    - C: The tool should be designed to be inclusive and safe for both left-handed and right-handed individuals.\n    - D: Handedness has no impact on tool design.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between handedness and genetics?\n    - A: Genetics solely determines handedness.\n    - B: Genetics has no influence on handedness.\n    - C: Genetics sets the odds but does not determine the outcome of handedness.\n    - D: Handedness is a random occurrence.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How does the rarity of left-handedness affect their performance in competitive situations?\n    - A: It puts them at a disadvantage.\n    - B: It has no impact.\n    - C: It provides an advantage, as opponents are less prepared to face them.\n    - D: The relationship is unknown.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be gained from combining insights from handedness research with theories of human evolution?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the development of cooperation and competition in societies.\n    - B: A greater understanding of the importance of genetics in determining handedness.\n    - C: A more comprehensive understanding of the advantages of right-handedness.\n    - D: A more nuanced understanding of the cultural bias against left-handedness.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can be gained from synthesizing data from various sports and populations on handedness?\n    - A: A more inclusive and effective strategy for promoting left-handed individuals in sports and society.\n    - B: A greater understanding of the importance of genetics in determining handedness.\n    - C: A more comprehensive understanding of the advantages of right-handedness.\n    - D: A more nuanced understanding of the cultural bias against left-handedness.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential critique of the \"fighting hypothesis\"?\n    - A: It overemphasizes the importance of genetics in determining handedness.\n    - B: It fails to account for the complexity of human evolution.\n    - C: It is too narrow in its focus on competitive situations, neglecting cooperative pressures.\n    - D: It is not supported by empirical evidence.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential justification for promoting inclusive design and strategies for left-handed individuals?\n    - A: It is a moral obligation to prioritize the needs of left-handed individuals.\n    - B: It is a means of promoting equality and fairness in society, as well as improving safety and performance.\n    - C: It is a way to gain a competitive advantage in sports and other competitive situations.\n    - D: It is not necessary, as left-handed individuals can adapt to a predominantly right-handed society.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
