What insight from handedness research might inform their strategy?\n    - A: Left-handed players are more common in baseball.\n    - B: Right-handed players have an advantage in competitive situations.\n    - C: Understanding the advantages of left-handedness in competitive sports can inform player selection and strategy.\n    - D: Handedness has no impact on baseball performance.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) A designer is creating a new tool for a predominantly right-handed society. What consideration from handedness research might they take into account?\n    - A: The tool should only be designed for right-handed individuals.\n    - B: The tool should be designed with a bias towards left-handed individuals.\n    - C: The tool should be designed to be inclusive and safe for both left-handed and right-handed individuals.\n    - D: Handedness has no impact on tool design.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between handedness and genetics?\n    - A: Genetics solely determines handedness.\n    - B: Genetics has no influence on handedness.\n    - C: Genetics is one of several factors that influence handedness, setting the odds but not determining the outcome.\n    - D: Handedness is a random occurrence.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the rarity of left-handedness and competitive situations?\n    - A: The rarity of left-handedness puts them at a disadvantage in competitive situations.\n    - B: The rarity of left-handedness has no impact on competitive situations.\n    - C: The rarity of left-handedness provides an advantage in competitive situations, as opponents are less prepared to face them.\n    - D: The relationship between handedness and competitive situations is unknown.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be gained from combining insights from handedness research with theories of human evolution?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the development of cooperation and competition in societies.\n    - B: A greater understanding of the importance of genetics in determining handedness.\n    - C: A more comprehensive understanding of the advantages of right-handedness.\n    - D: A more nuanced understanding of the cultural bias against left-handedness.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can be gained from synthesizing data from various sports and populations on handedness?\n    - A: A more inclusive and effective strategy for promoting left-handed individuals in sports and society.\n    - B: A greater understanding of the importance of genetics in determining handedness.\n    - C: A more comprehensive understanding of the advantages of right-handedness.\n    - D: A more nuanced understanding of the cultural bias against left-handedness.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential critique of the \"fighting hypothesis\"?\n    - A: It overemphasizes the importance of genetics in determining handedness.\n    - B: It fails to account for the complexity of human evolution.\n    - C: It is too narrow in its focus on competitive situations, neglecting cooperative pressures.\n    - D: It is not supported by empirical evidence.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential justification for promoting inclusive design and strategies for left-handed individuals?\n    - A: It is a moral obligation to prioritize the needs of left-handed individuals.\n    - B: It is a means of promoting equality and fairness in society, as well as improving safety and performance.\n    - C: It is a way to gain a competitive advantage in sports and other competitive situations.\n    - D: It is not necessary, as left-handed individuals can adapt to a predominantly right-handed society.\n[Correct answer]: B"
