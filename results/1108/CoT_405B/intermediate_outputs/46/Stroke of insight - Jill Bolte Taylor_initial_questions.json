A: She was fascinated by the human body.\n    - B: Her brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia.\n    - C: She wanted to become a neurosurgeon.\n    - D: She was interested in psychology.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which part of the brain connects the two hemispheres and has 300 million axonal fibers?\n    - A: Cerebellum\n    - B: Corpus callosum\n    - C: Brainstem\n    - D: Frontal lobe\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What was the main goal of Dr. Taylor's research before her stroke?\n    - A: To understand the biological differences between normal and mentally ill brains.\n    - B: To develop new treatments for stroke patients.\n    - C: To study the effects of meditation on the brain.\n    - D: To understand the role of the corpus callosum in brain function.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) According to Dr. Taylor's experience, what is associated with the right hemisphere of the brain?\n    - A: Individuality and separation from others\n    - B: Logic and analysis\n    - C: A sense of oneness and connection to the universe\n    - D: Language processing\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) How can understanding the differences between the two hemispheres help individuals with mental illnesses or brain disorders?\n    - A: By providing a cure for their condition.\n    - B: By helping them develop new skills and abilities.\n    - C: By informing the development of new treatments or therapies.\n    - D: By allowing them to switch between hemispheres at will.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is one way that Dr. Taylor's insights can be applied to everyday life?\n    - A: By cultivating a sense of competition and individuality.\n    - B: By developing new treatments for stroke patients.\n    - C: By cultivating a sense of inner peace and connection to others.\n    - D: By ignoring the role of the corpus callosum in brain function.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and contrasts)**\n\n1) What is one way that the two hemispheres of the brain differ in terms of their processing styles?\n    - A: The right hemisphere thinks linearly, while the left hemisphere thinks creatively.\n    - B: The right hemisphere thinks in pictures, while the left hemisphere thinks linearly.\n    - C: The right hemisphere is associated with logic, while the left hemisphere is associated with intuition.\n    - D: The right hemisphere is associated with language processing, while the left hemisphere is associated with spatial reasoning.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What does Dr. Taylor's experience highlight in terms of the relationship between the two hemispheres?\n    - A: The importance of favoring one hemisphere over the other.\n    - B: The need to eliminate the corpus callosum to improve brain function.\n    - C: The contrast between the two hemispheres and the importance of balancing them.\n    - D: The role of the brainstem in regulating the hemispheres.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis (New understanding)**\n\n1) What does Dr. Taylor's experience suggest about the power of individuals to control their thoughts and emotions?\n    - A: That individuals are completely at the mercy of their brain chemistry.\n    - B: That individuals can choose which hemisphere to engage, allowing for greater control.\n    - C: That individuals can only control their thoughts and emotions through medication.\n    - D: That individuals have no control over their thoughts and emotions.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How can Dr. Taylor's insights be combined with existing knowledge of neuroscience and psychology?\n    - A: By ignoring the role of the corpus callosum in brain function.\n    - B: By developing new theories or models of brain function.\n    - C: By rejecting the idea of hemispheric specialization.\n    - D: By focusing solely on the left hemisphere.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n1) What is one way that Dr. Taylor's experience can be evaluated in terms of its implications for our understanding of the brain and human behavior?\n    - A: By judging its inspirational value alone.\n    - B: By critiquing its generalizability to other individuals and contexts.\n    - C: By evaluating its potential applications in terms of their potential impact on society.\n    - D: By ignoring its implications for brain function and human behavior.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How can the potential applications of Dr. Taylor's research be evaluated?\n    - A: By considering their potential to promote positive change in individuals and society.\n    - B: By ignoring their potential impact on society and human well-being.\n    - C: By focusing solely on their potential to advance our understanding of brain function.\n    - D: By rejecting their potential applications altogether.\n[Correct answer]: A"
