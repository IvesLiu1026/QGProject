    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**:\n\n1) What is the primary characteristic of a parasite?\n    - A: It lives in symbiosis with its host.\n    - B: It is a type of virus.\n    - C: It lives on or inside another host organism, harming and sometimes killing it.\n    - D: It is a type of bacteria.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which parasite is known to infect tropical ants?\n    - A: Gordian worm\n    - B: Rabies virus\n    - C: Ophiocordyceps\n    - D: Plasmodium\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1) How do parasites ensure their survival?\n    - A: By producing their own food\n    - B: By transmitting from one host to the next, sometimes through an intermediate species\n    - C: By living in symbiosis with their hosts\n    - D: By altering their own behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a common method used by parasites to control their hosts' behavior?\n    - A: Producing proteins\n    - B: Causing inflammation\n    - C: Altering chemical levels in the brain\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Application**:\n\n1) What is a potential benefit of understanding how parasites manipulate their hosts' behavior?\n    - A: Development of new treatments or interventions for diseases\n    - B: Better understanding of ecosystems and species interactions\n    - C: Improved understanding of human psychology\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How could studying parasites' behavior manipulation inform strategies for controlling the spread of diseases?\n    - A: By identifying new targets for vaccination\n    - B: By understanding how parasites transmit from one host to the next\n    - C: By developing new treatments or interventions\n    - D: By altering human behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1) What is a key aspect of the relationship between parasites and their hosts?\n    - A: Symbiosis\n    - B: Mutualism\n    - C: Complex interactions, including manipulation of host behavior\n    - D: Commensalism\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a common effect of parasites' actions on their hosts?\n    - A: Increased aggressiveness\n    - B: Changes in behavior\n    - C: Death\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1) What could be a potential outcome of combining knowledge of parasites' behavior manipulation with understanding of ecosystems and species interactions?\n    - A: New insights into the natural world\n    - B: Development of new treatments or interventions for diseases\n    - C: Improved understanding of human psychology\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How could integrating information about parasites' methods of controlling behavior inform the development of new treatments or interventions for diseases?\n    - A: By identifying new targets for vaccination\n    - B: By understanding how parasites transmit from one host to the next\n    - C: By developing new treatments or interventions that target specific parasite-host interactions\n    - D: By altering human behavior\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1) What is a potential justification for studying parasites' behavior manipulation?\n    - A: It could lead to new insights into the natural world\n    - B: It could inform the development of new treatments or interventions for diseases\n    - C: It could improve our understanding of human psychology\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is a potential risk of parasites' behavior manipulation?\n    - A: Altering human behavior\n    - B: Increasing aggressiveness in hosts\n    - C: Causing death in hosts\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D"
