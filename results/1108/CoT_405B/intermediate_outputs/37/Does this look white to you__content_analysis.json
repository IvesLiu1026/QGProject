    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge**:\n\n1. The three primary colors of light are red, green, and blue.\n2. The retina has light-sensitive cells called cones that perceive color.\n3. There are three types of cones: red light, green light, and blue light cones.\n4. Some people have an extra cone, which allows them to see more colors.\n5. LCD screens use red and green light to create the illusion of yellow.\n6. Complementary colors of light mix to create white.\n7. White light excites all three cones (red, green, and blue).\n8. RGB screens use red, green, and blue pixels to create images.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1. The brain combines responses from red and green cones to perceive yellow.\n2. The way our eyes work tricks us into seeing colors that are not actually there.\n3. The difference between how paint and light mix colors.\n4. The concept of complementary colors and how they work with light.\n5. How staring at a color for a long time can affect our perception of other colors.\n\n**Application**:\n\n1. Understanding how LCD screens work can help us appreciate the technology behind them.\n2. Knowing how our eyes perceive color can help artists and designers create more effective visual displays.\n3. Recognizing the limitations of our color perception can help us design more accessible products.\n4. Understanding complementary colors can help us create more visually appealing designs.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. The relationship between the three types of cones and how they work together to perceive color.\n2. The difference between how paint and light mix colors, and why this is important.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between staring at a color for a long time and our perception of other colors.\n4. The contrast between how our brains perceive color and the actual physical properties of light.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1. Combining the concepts of complementary colors and how our eyes perceive color to create new visual effects.\n2. Using the knowledge of how LCD screens work to design new display technologies.\n3. Applying the understanding of color perception to create more effective visual displays in various fields (e.g., art, design, marketing).\n4. Integrating the concepts of color perception and technology to create innovative products.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1. Critiquing the limitations of our color perception and how it affects our understanding of the world.\n2. Evaluating the effectiveness of LCD screens in displaying colors and how they can be improved.\n3. Justifying the importance of understanding color perception in various fields (e.g., art, design, marketing).\n4. Assessing the potential impact of new display technologies on our perception of color and the world around us."
