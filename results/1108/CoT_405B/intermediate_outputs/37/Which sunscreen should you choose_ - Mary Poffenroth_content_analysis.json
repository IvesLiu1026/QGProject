Sunlight is composed of electromagnetic waves and is the primary source of ultraviolet radiation.\n2. UVA, UVB, and UVC are classified according to their wavelengths.\n3. Short wavelength UVC never reaches the Earth's surface.\n4. UVB and UVA can cause damage to DNA, age skin, and promote skin cancer.\n5. Sunscreen protects skin either physically or chemically.\n6. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are inorganic blockers used in physical sunscreens.\n7. SPF is a nonlinear scale of how much UVB radiation is needed to give protected skin a sunburn.\n8. The FDA has deemed US-marketed sunscreens safe.\n9. Coral reefs cover less than 1% of the Earth's underwater surface but are home to nearly 25% of all fish species.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. Understanding how sunscreens work is crucial in choosing the best sunscreen for individual needs.\n2. Sunscreens can be compared based on application method, SPF, and active ingredients.\n3. Mineral-based formulas with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are less irritating and more environmentally friendly.\n4. The effects of many active ingredients on the human body are still being researched.\n5. Coral bleaching is a stress condition caused by exposure to certain organic compounds found in chemical sunscreens.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. Choosing a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, but preferably 30, for adequate protection.\n2. Considering the potential health risks of inhaling sunscreen compounds from sprays.\n3. Opting for mineral-based sunscreens for sensitive skin or environmental concerns.\n4. Checking the active ingredients list for coral-harming components when planning to use sunscreen in water.\n5. Applying sunscreen regularly and reapplying as needed based on individual factors such as genetics and sun exposure.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between UV radiation and skin damage, including DNA damage and skin cancer.\n2. The comparison between physical and chemical sunscreens, including their mechanisms and effects.\n3. The impact of chemical sunscreens on coral reefs and marine ecosystems.\n4. The trade-offs between convenience (sprays) and potential health risks.\n5. The importance of considering individual factors, such as genetics and sun exposure, when choosing a sunscreen.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. Combining knowledge of sunscreen types and ingredients to make informed choices for individual needs and environmental concerns.\n2. Integrating understanding of UV radiation and skin damage to develop effective sun protection strategies.\n3. Considering the broader implications of sunscreen choices on marine ecosystems and human health.\n4. Developing a framework for evaluating sunscreen options based on multiple factors, including SPF, active ingredients, and environmental impact.\n5. Creating a plan for regular sunscreen application and reapplication based on individual factors and activities.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. Justifying the choice of a particular sunscreen based on individual needs and environmental concerns.\n2. Critiquing the use of chemical sunscreens in water-based activities due to their impact on coral reefs.\n3. Evaluating the effectiveness of different sunscreens based on SPF and active ingredients.\n4. Assessing the potential risks and benefits of using sprays versus lotions or other application methods.\n5. Defending the importance of considering environmental impact when making sunscreen choices."
