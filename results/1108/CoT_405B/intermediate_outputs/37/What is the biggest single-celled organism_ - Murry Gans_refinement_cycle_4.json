    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many microscopic cells make up an elephant?\n    - A: 100 trillion\n    - B: 1,000 trillion\n    - C: 10,000 trillion\n    - D: 100,000 trillion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the name of the largest single-celled organism that can reach up to 30 centimeters long?\n    - A: Caulerpa taxifolia\n    - B: Neuronaria gigas\n    - C: Cellaria maxima\n    - D: Algaezilla grandis\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) As a cell grows, how do its volume and surface area change relative to each other?\n    - A: Volume and surface area increase at the same rate\n    - B: Volume decreases, surface area increases\n    - C: Volume increases faster than surface area\n    - D: Surface area increases faster than volume\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is one key advantage of multicellular organisms over single-celled organisms?\n    - A: Ability to move faster\n    - B: Ability to support larger sizes\n    - C: Ability to reproduce more quickly\n    - D: Ability to respond to stimuli more rapidly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the options more concise.\n\n5) What is the primary factor limiting the size of cells?\n    - A: Relationship between surface area and volume\n    - B: Number of organelles\n    - C: Type of cellular membrane\n    - D: Amount of genetic material\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What do the adaptations of large single-celled organisms, such as Caulerpa taxifolia, illustrate?\n    - A: Importance of surface area and volume in determining size limitations\n    - B: Role of multicellularity in overcoming size limitations\n    - C: Effect of environmental factors on cell size\n    - D: Impact of genetic mutations on cell growth\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) Why do large cells often struggle to survive?\n    - A: They have too much surface area\n    - B: They have too little surface area for their volume\n    - C: They have too many organelles\n    - D: They have too much genetic material\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) How do structures like villi and microvilli help cells overcome size limitations?\n    - A: By increasing surface area\n    - B: By decreasing surface area\n    - C: By increasing volume\n    - D: By decreasing volume\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What is one way that single-celled organisms like Caulerpa taxifolia can overcome size limitations?\n    - A: By developing a more efficient cellular membrane\n    - B: By increasing their surface area through specialized structures\n    - C: By decreasing their volume\n    - D: By becoming multicellular\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) Why is it advantageous for multicellular organisms to be composed of many small cells rather than a few large cells?\n    - A: Because small cells are more efficient at nutrient uptake and waste removal\n    - B: Because small cells are more resilient to damage\n    - C: Because small cells can reproduce more quickly\n    - D: Both A and B\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What characteristic allows Caulerpa taxifolia to be considered a single-celled organism despite its large size?\n    - A: It has a large surface area\n    - B: It is coenocytic, having multiple nuclei\n    - C: It has a thick cellular membrane\n    - D: It has a small volume\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and accurate.\n\nNo further refinement is needed for questions 1-10."
