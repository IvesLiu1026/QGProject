    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) How often is the outer layer of human skin completely renewed?\n    - A: Every few days\n    - B: Every few weeks\n    - C: Every few months\n    - D: Every year\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the average lifespan of red blood cells in the human body?\n    - A: 2 months\n    - B: 4 months\n    - C: 6 months\n    - D: 1 year\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the main concept behind regeneration in the human body?\n    - A: The body remains static throughout life\n    - B: The body only regenerates certain parts\n    - C: The body constantly gains weight over time\n    - D: The body constantly sheds and replenishes its physical matter\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What effect does the breakdown of red blood cells have on the color of bruises and urine?\n    - A: It turns them green\n    - B: It has no effect on their color\n    - C: It turns them blue\n    - D: It turns them yellow\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) How does the rate of regeneration of the skin compare to that of the heart?\n    - A: Skin regenerates slower than the heart\n    - B: Skin regenerates faster than the heart\n    - C: Skin and the heart regenerate at the same rate\n    - D: The heart does not regenerate at all\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) Why does the lining of the stomach and intestines need to be replaced quickly?\n    - A: Due to exposure to air and water\n    - B: Due to exposure to sunlight and UV radiation\n    - C: Due to exposure to extreme temperatures\n    - D: Due to exposure to acid and bile\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) Which part of the human body remains relatively unchanged from birth to death?\n    - A: The brain\n    - B: The heart\n    - C: The lens of the eye\n    - D: The stomach\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How do the connections between neurons relate to memory storage?\n    - A: New neurons are constantly added to store new memories\n    - B: The connections between neurons are constantly changing to store new memories\n    - C: The number of neurons remains constant, but the connections between them change\n    - D: The regeneration of neurons has no effect on memory storage\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nAdditionally, I suggest adding two new questions to cover more key concepts from the transcript:\n\n9) How often are the cells in the stomach lining replaced?\n    - A: Every few days\n    - B: Every few weeks\n    - C: Every few months\n    - D: Every year\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What happens to fat cells when a person gains or loses weight?\n    - A: They are created or destroyed\n    - B: They change into muscle cells\n    - C: They get bigger or smaller\n    - D: They remain unchanged\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo further refinement is needed for the existing questions, but the additional questions can help to cover more key concepts from the transcript."
