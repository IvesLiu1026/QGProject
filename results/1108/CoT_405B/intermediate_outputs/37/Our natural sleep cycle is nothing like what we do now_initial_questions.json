    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n1) What is a common feature of internal clocks found in plants and animals?\n    - A: They are only found in beings with more than two cells.\n    - B: They are physical and can be seen under a microscope.\n    - C: They are chemical and found in every known being with two or more cells and some with one cell.\n    - D: They only respond to external light sources.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What happens to the human body clock when isolated from external light sources?\n    - A: It drives people to wake up at the same time every day.\n    - B: It becomes inactive and no longer regulates sleep patterns.\n    - C: It drives people to wake up slightly later each day.\n    - D: It has no effect on sleep patterns.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension**\n1) What is the main idea behind the concept of the human body clock?\n    - A: It is a physical clock that regulates sleep patterns.\n    - B: It is an internal clock that influences sleep patterns and daily routines.\n    - C: It only responds to external light sources.\n    - D: It is only found in animals.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the impact of artificial light on human sleep patterns and the natural rhythm of the body clock?\n    - A: It has no effect on sleep patterns or the body clock.\n    - B: It helps regulate sleep patterns and aligns with the body clock.\n    - C: It disrupts sleep patterns and affects the natural rhythm of the body clock.\n    - D: It only affects sleep patterns in people working night shifts.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application**\n1) A person working night shifts is having trouble sleeping during the day. What can they do to improve their sleep patterns?\n    - A: Stay up all day and sleep all night.\n    - B: Maintain a consistent sleep schedule, even on days off.\n    - C: Use artificial light to stay awake during the day.\n    - D: Avoid caffeine and nicotine before bedtime.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A traveler is crossing multiple time zones and wants to minimize the impact of jet lag. What can they do?\n    - A: Stay up all night and sleep during the day.\n    - B: Try to adjust their sleep schedule to the new time zone as quickly as possible.\n    - C: Use artificial light to stay awake during the day.\n    - D: Avoid napping during the day.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the relationship between the internal clocks of plants and animals and their environment?\n    - A: They are not affected by their environment.\n    - B: They are only affected by external light sources.\n    - C: They are influenced by their environment and help them prepare for changes in light.\n    - D: They only respond to temperature changes.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How do modern sleep patterns differ from natural sleep patterns in the absence of artificial light?\n    - A: Modern sleep patterns are the same as natural sleep patterns.\n    - B: Modern sleep patterns are more irregular and varied.\n    - C: Modern sleep patterns typically involve sleeping twice a night with a period of quiet wakefulness in between.\n    - D: Modern sleep patterns typically involve sleeping for shorter periods of time.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) How can knowledge of the body clock be combined with the impact of artificial light to improve sleep patterns and overall well-being?\n    - A: By using artificial light to stay awake during the day.\n    - B: By avoiding artificial light and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule.\n    - C: By staying up all night and sleeping during the day.\n    - D: By using caffeine and nicotine to stay awake.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What strategies can be proposed to mitigate the negative effects of modern societal demands, such as global travel and 24-hour business, on human well-being?\n    - A: Encourage people to work longer hours and travel more frequently.\n    - B: Provide education on the importance of maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and balancing daily routines.\n    - C: Increase the use of artificial light in workplaces and homes.\n    - D: Encourage people to take more naps during the day.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) Why is it important to understand the body clock in modern society?\n    - A: It is not important to understand the body clock.\n    - B: It can help improve sleep patterns and overall well-being.\n    - C: It can help people work longer hours and be more productive.\n    - D: It can help people travel more frequently and adjust to new time zones.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What are the costs and benefits of modern societal demands, such as global travel and 24-hour business, on human well-being?\n    - A: The benefits outweigh the costs, and modern societal demands have no negative effects on human well-being.\n    - B: The costs outweigh the benefits, and modern societal demands have significant negative effects on human well-being.\n    - C: The costs and benefits are equal, and modern societal demands have no impact on human well-being.\n    - D: The costs and benefits are unknown, and more research is needed.\n[Correct answer]: B"
