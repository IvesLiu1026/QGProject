    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many microscopic cells make up an elephant?\n    - A: 100 trillion\n    - B: 1,000 trillion\n    - C: 10,000 trillion\n    - D: 100,000 trillion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the name of the largest single-celled organism that can reach up to 30 centimeters long?\n    - A: Caulerpa taxifolia\n    - B: Neuronaria gigas\n    - C: Cellaria maxima\n    - D: Algaezilla grandis\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) How do a cell's volume and surface area change as it grows?\n    - A: Volume decreases, surface area increases\n    - B: Volume and surface area increase at the same rate\n    - C: Volume increases faster than surface area\n    - D: Surface area increases faster than volume\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is one advantage of multicellular organisms over single-celled organisms?\n    - A: Ability to move faster\n    - B: Ability to support larger sizes\n    - C: Ability to reproduce more quickly\n    - D: Ability to respond to stimuli more rapidly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a critical factor in determining the size limitations of cells?\n    - A: Relationship between surface area and volume\n    - B: Number of organelles\n    - C: Type of cellular membrane\n    - D: Amount of genetic material\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What do the adaptations of large single-celled organisms, such as Caulerpa taxifolia, highlight?\n    - A: Importance of surface area and volume in determining size limitations\n    - B: Role of multicellularity in overcoming size limitations\n    - C: Effect of environmental factors on cell size\n    - D: Impact of genetic mutations on cell growth\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) Why do large cells often struggle to survive?\n    - A: They have too much surface area\n    - B: They have too little surface area for their volume\n    - C: They have too many organelles\n    - D: They have too much genetic material\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How do structures like villi and microvilli help cells overcome size limitations?\n    - A: By increasing surface area\n    - B: By decreasing surface area\n    - C: By increasing volume\n    - D: By decreasing volume\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What is one way that single-celled organisms like Caulerpa taxifolia can overcome size limitations?\n    - A: By developing a more efficient cellular membrane\n    - B: By increasing their surface area through specialized structures\n    - C: By decreasing their volume\n    - D: By becoming multicellular\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) Why is it advantageous for multicellular organisms to be composed of many small cells rather than a few large cells?\n    - A: Because small cells are more efficient at nutrient uptake and waste removal\n    - B: Because small cells are more resilient to damage\n    - C: Because small cells can reproduce more quickly\n    - D: Both A and B\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript. I also rephrased some questions to make them more concise and clear. Let me know if further refinement is needed."
