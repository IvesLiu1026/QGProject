    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge** (Recall):\n- Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness.\n- Plants and animals have internal clocks that help them prepare for changes in light.\n- These internal clocks are chemical and found in every known being with two or more cells and some with one cell.\n- Horseshoe crabs have internal cycles that correspond with the tide.\n- Humans have an internal clock known as the \"body clock.\"\n- The body clock drives people to wake up slightly later each day when isolated from external light sources.\n- Humans originally evolved near the equator with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness.\n- In the absence of artificial light, people sleep twice a night, with a period of quiet wakefulness in between.\n\n**Comprehension** (Understanding):\n- The concept of internal clocks and how they affect the behavior of plants and animals.\n- The idea that humans have an internal body clock that influences their sleep patterns and daily routines.\n- The impact of artificial light on human sleep patterns and the natural rhythm of the body clock.\n- The cultural significance of the body clock and its influence on human behavior.\n\n**Application** (Real-world scenarios):\n- Understanding how the body clock affects people working night shifts or traveling across time zones.\n- Recognizing the importance of maintaining a consistent sleep schedule to align with the body clock.\n- Applying knowledge of the body clock to improve productivity and overall well-being.\n- Considering the impact of artificial light on sleep patterns and daily routines in modern society.\n\n**Analysis** (Relationships and contrasts):\n- The relationship between the internal clocks of plants and animals and their environment.\n- The contrast between the natural sleep patterns of humans in the absence of artificial light and modern sleep patterns.\n- The cause-and-effect connection between the body clock and human behavior, such as the impact of perpetual daylight or darkness on cultural practices.\n- The relationship between the body clock and the release of hormones, such as prolactin.\n\n**Synthesis** (Combining ideas):\n- Combining the concept of internal clocks with the idea of cultural influences to understand how the body clock shapes human behavior.\n- Integrating knowledge of the body clock with the impact of artificial light to propose strategies for improving sleep patterns and overall well-being.\n- Considering the intersection of the body clock and modern societal demands, such as global travel and 24-hour business, to develop solutions for mitigating the negative effects.\n\n**Evaluation** (Judgment and critique):\n- Evaluating the importance of understanding the body clock in modern society.\n- Assessing the costs and benefits of modern societal demands, such as global travel and 24-hour business, on human well-being.\n- Justifying the need for a consistent sleep schedule and a balanced daily routine to align with the body clock.\n- Critiquing the impact of artificial light on human sleep patterns and daily routines, and proposing alternatives to minimize its effects."
