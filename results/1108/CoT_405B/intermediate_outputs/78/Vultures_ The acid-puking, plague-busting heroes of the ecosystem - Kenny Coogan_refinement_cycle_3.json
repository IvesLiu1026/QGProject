    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the approximate wingspan of the Lappet-faced vulture?\n    - A: 1.5 meters\n    - B: 2 meters\n    - C: 3 meters\n    - D: 4 meters\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the estimated decline in the vulture population in India since the 1990s?\n    - A: 50%\n    - B: 75%\n    - C: 85%\n    - D: 95%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is the primary role of vultures in maintaining ecosystem health?\n    - A: Regulating prey populations\n    - B: Disposing of carcasses and preventing disease spread\n    - C: Maintaining nutrient cycles\n    - D: Pollination and seed dispersal\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What adaptation allows vultures to digest diseased carrion and waste?\n    - A: Their powerful beaks\n    - B: Their strong immune systems\n    - C: Their intelligence\n    - D: Their acidic stomachs\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What is a significant consequence of the decline of vulture populations in India?\n    - A: Decrease in rabies cases\n    - B: Increase in biodiversity\n    - C: Increase in rabies cases\n    - D: No impact on human health\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is the name of the veterinary drug that has contributed to the decline of vulture populations in India?\n    - A: Diclofenac\n    - B: Ibuprofen\n    - C: Acetaminophen\n    - D: Aspirin\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the purpose of vulture restaurants in conservation efforts?\n    - A: To provide a safe food source for vultures\n    - B: To promote human-vulture conflict\n    - C: To reduce conservation efforts\n    - D: To increase the use of safe veterinary drugs\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) How do vultures' acidic stomachs protect them from disease?\n    - A: By neutralizing pathogens\n    - B: By allowing them to digest diseased carrion and waste\n    - C: By reducing their appetite\n    - D: By increasing their water intake\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the estimated number of people killed by rabies in India each year?\n    - A: 10,000\n    - B: 20,000\n    - C: 30,000\n    - D: 40,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) Why are vultures important indicators of ecosystem health?\n    - A: Because they regulate prey populations\n    - B: Because they dispose of carcasses and prevent disease spread\n    - C: Because their population sizes reflect ecosystem health\n    - D: Because they maintain nutrient cycles\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What approach is necessary to address the decline of vulture populations?\n    - A: A single, targeted solution\n    - B: A holistic approach considering broader environmental issues\n    - C: A focus on human-vulture conflict\n    - D: A reduction in conservation efforts\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) How can the effectiveness of conservation efforts be evaluated?\n    - A: Based on their economic costs\n    - B: Based on their impact on vulture populations and ecosystem health\n    - C: Based on their popularity among local communities\n    - D: Based on their duration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 13-15 as they were redundant or not essential to the key concepts. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and concision. Additionally, I ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
