Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the planet is approximately farmland?\n    - A: 20%\n    - B: 30%\n    - C: 40%\n    - D: 50%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) When did humans begin farming, according to the transcript?\n    - A: 5,000 years ago\n    - B: 10,000 years ago\n    - C: 15,000 years ago\n    - D: 20,000 years ago\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What was the primary outcome of the first agricultural revolution?\n    - A: Increased food production at the expense of the environment\n    - B: Decreased food production\n    - C: Enabled people to settle, build, and create\n    - D: Reduced water usage\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is required for the next agricultural revolution?\n    - A: Increased use of conventional farming methods\n    - B: A focus on sustainability, environmental protection, and increased food production\n    - C: Decreased crop production\n    - D: Increased use of pesticides\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is an example of a conservation-oriented approach to farming mentioned in the transcript?\n    - A: Implementing solar-powered cold storage capsules\n    - B: Using drones and field robots to monitor and manage crops\n    - C: Intertwining farmland with tropical habitat\n    - D: Experimenting with new strains of rice\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What method is being implemented in Zambia to improve crop production and reduce forest loss?\n    - A: Investing in locally specific methods\n    - B: Implementing solar-powered cold storage capsules\n    - C: Using drones and field robots to monitor and manage crops\n    - D: Experimenting with new strains of rice\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between agriculture and climate change?\n    - A: Agriculture has no impact on climate change\n    - B: Agriculture contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change affects agricultural productivity\n    - C: Climate change has no impact on agriculture\n    - D: Agriculture reduces greenhouse gas emissions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does reducing food waste affect pressure on the land?\n    - A: Reducing food waste increases pressure on the land\n    - B: Reducing food waste has no impact on pressure on the land\n    - C: Reducing food waste can help reduce pressure on the land\n    - D: Increasing food waste reduces pressure on the land\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What type of agricultural system is being promoted as sustainable and environmentally friendly?\n    - A: Combining high-tech and low-cost methods\n    - B: Implementing conventional farming methods\n    - C: Using drones and field robots to monitor and manage crops\n    - D: Experimenting with new strains of rice\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) How can biodiversity be promoted in agriculture?\n    - A: By developing new technologies and practices that take into account local ecosystems\n    - B: By implementing conventional farming methods\n    - C: By using drones and field robots to monitor and manage crops\n    - D: By experimenting with new strains of rice\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) Why is a global shift toward more plant-based diets being promoted?\n    - A: To increase greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: To reduce pressure on the land and mitigate environmental degradation\n    - C: To decrease crop production\n    - D: To increase food waste\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a critique of large-scale agriculture?\n    - A: It promotes sustainable practices and reduces environmental impact\n    - B: It contributes to environmental degradation and promotes unsustainable practices\n    - C: It has no impact on the environment\n    - D: It reduces greenhouse gas emissions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and concision, but the overall content and correct answers remain the same. No more refinement needed."
