    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the approximate wingspan of an Egyptian vulture?\n    - A: 1 meter\n    - B: 180 centimeters\n    - C: 2 meters\n    - D: 3 meters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the name of the veterinary drug that is fatal to vultures?\n    - A: Ibuprofen\n    - B: Diclofenac\n    - C: Aspirin\n    - D: Ketoprofen\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What role do vultures play in the ecosystem?\n    - A: They are primary predators, controlling prey populations.\n    - B: They are scavengers, disposing of carcasses and preventing disease spread.\n    - C: They are seed dispersers, helping to propagate plant species.\n    - D: They are decomposers, breaking down organic matter.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How do Egyptian vultures compensate for their small size?\n    - A: They use their speed to outmaneuver larger birds.\n    - B: They use their intelligence to open ostrich eggs with rocks.\n    - C: They use their agility to evade predators.\n    - D: They use their strong beaks to defend themselves.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential solution to provide a safe food source for vultures?\n    - A: Establishing a network of bird feeders\n    - B: Creating vulture restaurants with drug-free livestock\n    - C: Implementing a vulture-feeding program in urban areas\n    - D: Encouraging farmers to use more sustainable agricultural practices\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can be done to help repopulate vulture communities?\n    - A: Banning Diclofenac and establishing breeding programs\n    - B: Increasing the use of veterinary drugs\n    - C: Reducing conservation efforts\n    - D: Implementing habitat restoration projects\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What are some effective ways to help repopulate vulture communities?\n    - A: Banning Diclofenac, establishing breeding programs, and creating vulture restaurants\n    - B: Increasing the use of veterinary drugs\n    - C: Reducing conservation efforts\n    - D: Implementing habitat restoration projects\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is the relationship between vulture size and dominance in the pecking order?\n    - A: Larger birds are dominated by smaller ones.\n    - B: Smaller birds are usually dominated by larger ones, but intelligence can also play a role.\n    - C: Size has no effect on dominance.\n    - D: Dominance is solely determined by aggression.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How does the decline of vulture populations affect the ecosystem?\n    - A: It leads to a decrease in disease transmission and contamination of drinking water.\n    - B: It leads to an increase in ecosystem balance and biodiversity.\n    - C: It leads to an increase in disease transmission and contamination of drinking water.\n    - D: It has no significant impact on the ecosystem.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What enables vultures to play a crucial role in the ecosystem?\n    - A: Their bright plumage and complex songs\n    - B: Their acidic stomachs and powerful beaks\n    - C: Their small size and agility\n    - D: Their unique feather structure and adaptations for flight\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What are some of the main factors contributing to the decline of vulture populations?\n    - A: Habitat loss, poisoning, use of veterinary drugs, and electricity pylons\n    - B: Climate change, overhunting, and pollution\n    - C: Human population growth, urbanization, and agriculture\n    - D: A combination of natural and human-induced factors\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What can be critiqued about the use of Diclofenac in veterinary medicine?\n    - A: Its effectiveness in treating animal diseases\n    - B: Its devastating impact on vulture populations\n    - C: Its cost-effectiveness compared to other treatments\n    - D: Its lack of regulation and oversight in certain regions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) How can the importance of vultures in the ecosystem be justified?\n    - A: By their role in controlling prey populations\n    - B: By their role in preventing disease transmission and maintaining ecosystem balance\n    - C: By their role in pollination and seed dispersal\n    - D: By their unique ecological niche and adaptations for scavenging\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n14) What is a unique adaptation of vultures that allows them to digest diseased carrion and waste?\n    - A: Their strong beaks and sharp talons\n    - B: Their acidic stomachs with the lowest gastric pH in the animal kingdom\n    - C: Their specialized feathers and lightweight skeleton\n    - D: Their highly efficient respiratory system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n15) What is a consequence of the decline of vulture populations in regions where they have gone extinct?\n    - A: Corpses take longer to decay, contaminating drinking water and spreading disease.\n    - B: Ecosystem balance and biodiversity increase.\n    - C: Disease transmission and contamination of drinking water decrease.\n    - D: There is no significant impact on the ecosystem.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed for the existing questions. However, I added two new questions (14 and 15) to cover additional key concepts from the transcript."
