    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Where was Rosalind Franklin born?\n    - A: Cambridge in 1920\n    - B: London in 1925\n    - C: London in 1920\n    - D: King's College in 1915\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Who won the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA?\n    - A: Watson, Crick, and Franklin\n    - B: Watson, Crick, and Wilkins\n    - C: Franklin, Wilkins, and Watson\n    - D: Crick, Wilkins, and Franklin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What challenges did Rosalind Franklin face in her academic career, particularly at King's College?\n    - A: Sexism, isolation, and limited access to resources\n    - B: Lack of funding for her research\n    - C: Limited access to x-ray techniques\n    - D: None of the above\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What was the outcome of Franklin's work on the structure of viruses?\n    - A: A Nobel Prize for Franklin in 1982\n    - B: A Nobel Prize for a colleague in 1982\n    - C: A breakthrough in the discovery of DNA's structure\n    - D: The development of a new x-ray technique\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How has the discovery of the structure of DNA impacted various fields?\n    - A: Only medicine has benefited from the discovery\n    - B: Only biology has been revolutionized by the discovery\n    - C: Medicine, biology, and agriculture have been revolutionized\n    - D: The discovery has had no significant impact\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What was the practical application of Franklin's work on the structure of coal?\n    - A: Better gas masks for the British during World War I\n    - B: Better gas masks for the British during World War II\n    - C: Improved x-ray techniques for studying DNA\n    - D: No practical application\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How did Watson and Crick use Franklin's data in their development of the DNA model?\n    - A: They did not use her data\n    - B: They used her data without her knowledge or permission\n    - C: They collaborated with her to develop the model\n    - D: They only used her data as a reference\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How did Watson's portrayal of Franklin in \"The Double Helix\" compare to her actual contributions?\n    - A: The portrayal was accurate and fair\n    - B: The portrayal was inaccurate, but not sexist\n    - C: The portrayal was inaccurate and sexist\n    - D: The portrayal was not significant\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be understood by combining Franklin's story with the broader context of women in science?\n    - A: The challenges faced by women in science are insignificant\n    - B: Franklin's experiences were unique and not representative of women in science\n    - C: The challenges faced by Franklin were similar to those faced by other women in science\n    - D: The context of women in science is irrelevant to Franklin's story\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can be understood by integrating Franklin's work on DNA with her work on viruses?\n    - A: Her work on DNA was more significant than her work on viruses\n    - B: Her work on viruses was more significant than her work on DNA\n    - C: Her overall scientific contributions were significant and diverse\n    - D: Her work on DNA and viruses was not significant\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) Why was the Nobel Prize award in 1962 not fair in recognizing the contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA?\n    - A: Franklin's contributions were not significant\n    - B: Franklin's contributions were not recognized due to sexism\n    - C: The award can only be given to living individuals\n    - D: The award was not given to the most deserving individuals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined questions 1-11 show no significant changes, as they were already well-structured and aligned with the key concepts in the transcript. However, minor adjustments were made to question 3 to make it more concise and accurate.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
