    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the most widely used construction material in the world?\n    - A: Steel\n    - B: Wood\n    - C: Concrete\n    - D: Brick\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the estimated lifespan of concrete before it starts to show signs of cracking and degradation?\n    - A: 50-60 years\n    - B: 20-30 years\n    - C: 10-20 years\n    - D: 100-150 years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary weakness of concrete that can lead to costly repairs and maintenance?\n    - A: Its tendency to absorb water\n    - B: Its tendency to crack and degrade over time\n    - C: Its tendency to shrink or expand with temperature changes\n    - D: Its tendency to corrode steel reinforcements\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the process by which concrete forms and hardens?\n    - A: Melting and cooling of aggregates and cement\n    - B: Mixing of aggregates and cement, followed by a chemical reaction called hydration\n    - C: Compacting and heating of aggregates and cement\n    - D: Mixing of aggregates and cement, followed by a physical reaction called crystallization\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Where can self-healing concrete be used to reduce maintenance costs and extend lifespan?\n    - A: Only in bridges and highways\n    - B: Only in residential and commercial buildings\n    - C: In various structures, such as bridges, highways, skyscrapers, and buildings\n    - D: Only in industrial and manufacturing facilities\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is one potential benefit of using self-healing concrete?\n    - A: Increased weight and density\n    - B: Reduced strength and durability\n    - C: Reduced financial and environmental cost of concrete production and maintenance\n    - D: Increased maintenance costs and requirements\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between tiny cracks in concrete and the corrosion of steel reinforcements?\n    - A: Tiny cracks have no effect on steel reinforcements\n    - B: Tiny cracks can channel water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide that corrode steel reinforcements\n    - C: Tiny cracks can only be caused by steel reinforcements\n    - D: Tiny cracks can only be prevented by steel reinforcements\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is autogenous healing in concrete?\n    - A: A type of chemical reaction that strengthens concrete\n    - B: A type of physical reaction that weakens concrete\n    - C: A natural self-healing mechanism that occurs in concrete\n    - D: A type of biological reaction that breaks down concrete\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can bacterial or fungal spores be used to enhance the self-healing properties of concrete?\n    - A: By producing minerals that fill cracks and gaps\n    - B: By breaking down organic materials in the concrete mix\n    - C: By enhancing the strength and durability of concrete\n    - D: By reducing the environmental impact of concrete production\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is one potential way to create more resilient and environmentally friendly structures?\n    - A: Using only traditional building materials and methods\n    - B: Combining self-healing concrete with other sustainable building materials and methods\n    - C: Using only self-healing concrete and ignoring other sustainability considerations\n    - D: Ignoring sustainability considerations and focusing on cost and efficiency\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is one factor to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of self-healing concrete?\n    - A: Only the initial cost and investment\n    - B: Only the environmental impact and sustainability\n    - C: The cost-benefit analysis in various contexts and environments\n    - D: Only the aesthetic appeal and design\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the potential impact of self-healing concrete on the construction industry?\n    - A: Reduced maintenance costs and extended lifespan of structures\n    - B: Increased environmental sustainability and reduced carbon footprint\n    - C: Improved aesthetic appeal and design flexibility\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI removed questions 13-16 as they were redundant or too specific. I also rephrased some questions to make them clearer and more concise. Additionally, I ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
