B: The body's ability to dissipate heat\n    - C: The body's ability to conserve energy\n    - D: The body's ability to maintain blood pressure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What can be a devastating consequence of exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: Temporary muscle cramps\n    - B: Mild dehydration\n    - C: Liver damage and blood clot formation\n    - D: Temporary fatigue\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application:**\n\n1) What should coaches and trainers do to prevent exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: Provide inadequate hydration and minimal rest breaks\n    - B: Provide adequate hydration and rest breaks\n    - C: Ignore the risks of exertional heat stroke\n    - D: Rely solely on medical staff for prevention\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What should medical staff be trained in to properly treat exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: The use of oral thermometers and gradual cooling methods\n    - B: The use of rectal thermometers and rapid cooling methods\n    - C: The use of tympanic thermometers and delayed cooling methods\n    - D: The use of axillary thermometers and passive cooling methods\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1) What is the relationship between intense exercise, heat, and humidity in causing exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: Intense exercise, heat, and humidity are unrelated to exertional heat stroke\n    - B: Intense exercise and heat are related to exertional heat stroke, but humidity is not\n    - C: Intense exercise, heat, and humidity all contribute to the development of exertional heat stroke\n    - D: Intense exercise and humidity are related to exertional heat stroke, but heat is not\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the main difference between compensable and uncompensable heat stress?\n    - A: Compensable heat stress occurs in hot environments, while uncompensable heat stress occurs in cold environments\n    - B: Compensable heat stress occurs when the body can dissipate heat, while uncompensable heat stress occurs when the body cannot\n    - C: Compensable heat stress occurs during intense exercise, while uncompensable heat stress occurs during low-intensity exercise\n    - D: Compensable heat stress occurs in humid environments, while uncompensable heat stress occurs in dry environments\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1) How can knowledge of exertional heat stroke be combined with an understanding of athletic training and competition to develop strategies for prevention and treatment?\n    - A: By ignoring the risks of exertional heat stroke and focusing on athletic performance\n    - B: By developing strategies that prioritize athletic performance over athlete safety\n    - C: By integrating knowledge of exertional heat stroke into athletic training and competition to develop evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies\n    - D: By relying solely on medical staff for prevention and treatment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How can insights from the transcript be used to develop new approaches to preventing and treating exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: By identifying genetic markers for susceptibility to exertional heat stroke\n    - B: By developing more effective cooling methods\n    - C: By integrating information on exertional heat stroke with knowledge of human physiology to understand the underlying mechanisms of the condition\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1) What is the primary justification for increased awareness and education on exertional heat stroke among athletes, coaches, and medical staff?\n    - A: The low risk of exertional heat stroke\n    - B: The lack of effective prevention and treatment strategies\n    - C: The potential for devastating consequences, including liver damage and death\n    - D: The limited understanding of exertional heat stroke among medical professionals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How should the effectiveness of current prevention and treatment strategies for exertional heat stroke be evaluated?\n    - A: By relying solely on anecdotal evidence\n    - B: By conducting rigorous scientific studies to assess their efficacy\n    - C: By ignoring the risks of exertional heat stroke and focusing on other health concerns\n    - D: By relying solely on expert opinion\n[Correct answer]: B"
