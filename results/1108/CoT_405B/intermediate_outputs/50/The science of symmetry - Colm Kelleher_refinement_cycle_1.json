    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In math and science, what does symmetry refer to?\n    - A: A property of an object that changes after a transformation\n    - B: A property of an object that remains unchanged after a transformation\n    - C: A type of geometric shape\n    - D: A concept only applicable to living organisms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What type of symmetry is exhibited by the human body?\n    - A: Rotational symmetry\n    - B: Bilateral symmetry\n    - C: Radial symmetry\n    - D: No symmetry\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the significance of bilateral symmetry in animals?\n    - A: It is a rare feature found only in a few species\n    - B: It is a common feature of animals that are designed for movement\n    - C: It is only found in animals with radial symmetry\n    - D: It is not related to an animal's lifestyle or evolutionary history\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What can body symmetries provide clues about in animals?\n    - A: Only their physical characteristics\n    - B: Only their evolutionary history\n    - C: Both their lifestyle and evolutionary history\n    - D: Neither their lifestyle nor evolutionary history\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How can understanding symmetry in biology help us?\n    - A: It can only help us understand the evolution of different species\n    - B: It can only help us understand the adaptations of different species to their environments\n    - C: It can help us understand both the evolution and adaptations of different species\n    - D: It has no practical applications in biology\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is the relationship between the development of a head and sensory organs and the development of bilateral symmetry?\n    - A: The development of a head and sensory organs leads to radial symmetry\n    - B: The development of a head and sensory organs leads to bilateral symmetry\n    - C: The development of bilateral symmetry leads to the development of a head and sensory organs\n    - D: There is no relationship between the two\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What can be inferred from the contrast between different types of symmetries?\n    - A: That symmetry is only found in living organisms\n    - B: That symmetry is only found in geometric shapes\n    - C: That different types of symmetries have different functions and adaptations\n    - D: That symmetry is not an important concept in biology\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How can combining the concepts of symmetry and evolution help us?\n    - A: It can only help us understand the evolution of different species\n    - B: It can only help us understand the adaptations of different species to their environments\n    - C: It can help us reconstruct the tree of life and understand the evolution of different species\n    - D: It has no practical applications in biology\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be gained by integrating the ideas of symmetry and adaptation?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the evolution of different species\n    - B: A deeper understanding of the adaptations of different species to their environments\n    - C: A deeper understanding of both the evolution and adaptations of different species\n    - D: No new insights or understanding\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) Why is symmetry important in biology?\n    - A: Because it is a fundamental property of the natural world\n    - B: Because it helps us understand the evolution and adaptation of different species\n    - C: Because it is only found in living organisms\n    - D: Because it has no practical applications in biology\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were redundant and not necessary to assess the understanding of the concept of symmetry.\n\nNo more refinement needed for the remaining questions."
