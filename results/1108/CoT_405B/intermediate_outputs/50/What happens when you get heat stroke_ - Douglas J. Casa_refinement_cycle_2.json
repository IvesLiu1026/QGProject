    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary criterion for diagnosing exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: A core body temperature greater than 38 degrees Celsius\n    - B: A core body temperature greater than 39 degrees Celsius\n    - C: A core body temperature greater than 40 degrees Celsius\n    - D: A core body temperature greater than 41 degrees Celsius\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What percentage of the energy used during exercise is transformed into heat?\n    - A: 60%\n    - B: 70%\n    - C: 80%\n    - D: 90%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is a crucial factor in preventing exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: The body's ability to generate heat\n    - B: The body's ability to dissipate heat effectively\n    - C: The body's ability to conserve energy\n    - D: The body's ability to maintain blood pressure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What can be a devastating consequence of exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: Temporary muscle cramps\n    - B: Mild dehydration\n    - C: Liver damage, blood clot formation, and failure of vital organs\n    - D: Temporary fatigue\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What should be done first when treating someone with exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: Transport the victim to a medical facility\n    - B: Remove athletic gear and initiate rapid cooling\n    - C: Provide hydration and rest breaks\n    - D: Call emergency services but do not initiate cooling\n[Correct answer]: B (Revised to match question 11) \n    - A: Call emergency services and initiate rapid cooling on site\n    - B: Remove athletic gear and transport the victim to a medical facility\n    - C: Provide hydration and rest breaks\n    - D: Call emergency services but do not initiate cooling\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is the most feasible and accurate way to assess core body temperature in cases of suspected exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: Oral thermometer\n    - B: Rectal thermometer\n    - C: Tympanic thermometer\n    - D: Axillary thermometer\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between intense exercise, heat, and humidity in causing exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: Intense exercise, heat, and humidity are unrelated to exertional heat stroke\n    - B: Intense exercise and heat are related to exertional heat stroke, but humidity is not\n    - C: Intense exercise, heat, and humidity all contribute to the development of exertional heat stroke\n    - D: Intense exercise and humidity are related to exertional heat stroke, but heat is not\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the main difference between compensable and uncompensable heat stress?\n    - A: Compensable heat stress occurs in hot environments, while uncompensable heat stress occurs in cold environments\n    - B: Compensable heat stress occurs when the body can dissipate heat, while uncompensable heat stress occurs when the body cannot\n    - C: Compensable heat stress occurs during intense exercise, while uncompensable heat stress occurs during low-intensity exercise\n    - D: Compensable heat stress occurs in humid environments, while uncompensable heat stress occurs in dry environments\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the primary justification for increased awareness and education on exertional heat stroke among athletes, coaches, and medical staff?\n    - A: The low risk of exertional heat stroke\n    - B: The lack of effective prevention and treatment strategies\n    - C: The potential for devastating consequences, including liver damage and death\n    - D: The limited understanding of exertional heat stroke among medical professionals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How should the effectiveness of current prevention and treatment strategies for exertional heat stroke be evaluated?\n    - A: By relying solely on anecdotal evidence\n    - B: By conducting rigorous scientific studies to assess their efficacy\n    - C: By ignoring the risks of exertional heat stroke and focusing on other health concerns\n    - D: By relying solely on expert opinion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the key principle in treating exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: Cool first, transport second\n    - B: Transport first, cool second\n    - C: Provide hydration and rest breaks\n    - D: Call emergency services but do not initiate cooling\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is the outcome of proper care for exertional heat stroke?\n    - A: 50% survival rate\n    - B: 75% survival rate\n    - C: 90% survival rate\n    - D: 100% survival rate\n[Correct answer]: D"
