The speaker teaches adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace.\n2. The definition of doodling has changed over time, from a simpleton or fool (17th century) to swindle or ridicule (18th century) to a corrupt politician (19th century) to dawdling or making meaningless marks (today).\n3. Freud's theory that doodles can be used to analyze a person's psyche is not accurate.\n4. Doodling engages all four learning modalities (visual, auditory, reading and writing, and kinesthetic) simultaneously.\n5. Anthropological research has shown that children exhibit a shared and growing complexity in visual language as they grow.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. The speaker believes that doodling has a profound impact on the way we process information and solve problems.\n2. The cultural norm against doodling in settings where learning is supposed to occur is powerful and reinforced by the press.\n3. The speaker thinks that our culture is too focused on verbal information and neglects the value of doodling.\n4. Doodling is a tool that can be used to help people think and retain information.\n5. The speaker believes that doodling should be leveraged in situations where information density is high and the need for processing is high.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. Using doodling as a tool to help people think and retain information in the workplace or classroom.\n2. Leveraging doodling as a portal to move people into higher levels of visual literacy.\n3. Encouraging people to doodle in situations where they need to process complex information.\n4. Using doodling as a way to engage multiple learning modalities simultaneously.\n5. Creating a new definition of doodling that reflects its value as a tool for thinking and problem-solving.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The relationship between doodling and intellectual thought is not necessarily negative, as commonly believed.\n2. The cultural norm against doodling is based on outdated and inaccurate assumptions.\n3. The press reinforces the negative perception of doodling by using words like \"discovered\" or \"caught\" when reporting on doodling.\n4.

The benefits of doodling, such as improved retention and problem-solving, are not widely recognized.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. Combining doodling with other learning modalities to create a more effective way of processing information.\n2. Using doodling as a way to bridge the gap between verbal and visual information.\n3. Creating a new understanding of doodling as a valuable tool for thinking and problem-solving.\n4. Integrating doodling into educational settings to improve learning outcomes.\n5.
