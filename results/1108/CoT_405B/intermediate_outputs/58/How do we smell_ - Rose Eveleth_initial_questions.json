    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**:\n\n1. What percentage of the nasal cavity is used to filter air before it hits the lungs?\n    - A: 70%\n    - B: 80%\n    - C: 90%\n    - D: 95%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2. How many different smells can adults typically distinguish?\n    - A: 1,000\n    - B: 5,000\n    - C: 10,000\n    - D: 20,000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1. What is the primary function of the olfactory epithelium in the human nose?\n    - A: To filter air before it hits the lungs\n    - B: To sense smells and send signals to the brain\n    - C: To regulate body temperature\n    - D: To produce mucus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. How is the sense of smell processed in the brain compared to sight and sound?\n    - A: It is processed in the same way as sight and sound\n    - B: It is processed more slowly than sight and sound\n    - C: It has a direct route to various regions of the brain\n    - D: It is only processed in the limbic system\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application**:\n\n1. A person with anosmia is unable to smell their favorite food, which affects their ability to taste it. What can they do to compensate for this loss?\n    - A: Use more salt and sugar to enhance flavor\n    - B: Eat foods with stronger textures to stimulate other senses\n    - C: Try to recall memories of the food's taste and smell\n    - D: Avoid eating the food altogether\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2. A researcher is studying the neural basis of smell perception. How can they apply their knowledge to help people with smell-related disorders?\n    - A: By developing new treatments for anosmia\n    - B: By creating more effective odor-reducing products\n    - C: By improving memory recall techniques\n    - D: By studying the sense of taste instead\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. What is the relationship between the size of the olfactory epithelium and the strength of an animal's sense of smell?\n    - A: The larger the olfactory epithelium, the weaker the sense of smell\n    - B: The smaller the olfactory epithelium, the stronger the sense of smell\n    - C: There is no correlation between the size of the olfactory epithelium and the strength of the sense of smell\n    - D: The larger the olfactory epithelium, the stronger the sense of smell\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2. A person with allicin anosmia (inability to smell garlic) and a person with eugenol anosmia (inability to smell cloves) are compared. What can be inferred about their conditions?\n    - A: They have the same underlying cause\n    - B: They have different underlying causes\n    - C: They have the same impact on daily life\n    - D: They have different impacts on daily life\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1. A researcher is studying the neural basis of smell perception and its relationship to brain function. What new theory can they develop?\n    - A: The sense of smell is only processed in the limbic system\n    - B: The sense of smell is closely linked to the brain's emotional centers\n    - C: The sense of smell is processed in the same way as sight and sound\n    - D: The sense of smell is not important for human experience\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. A researcher is integrating information about anosmia with research on other sensory disorders. What common underlying mechanism can they identify?\n    - A: Genetic mutations\n    - B: Environmental factors\n    - C: Brain processing abnormalities\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1. What is the significance of the sense of smell in human experience?\n    - A: It is not important for daily life\n    - B: It is only important for emotional responses\n    - C: It is crucial for memory recall and emotional responses\n    - D: It is only important for taste perception\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. A researcher is evaluating the effectiveness of a new treatment for anosmia. What criteria should they use to assess its success?\n    - A: The treatment's ability to restore smell perception\n    - B: The treatment's ability to improve memory recall\n    - C: The treatment's ability to reduce symptoms of depression\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D"
