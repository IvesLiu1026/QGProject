    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and have accurate correct answers.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the nasal cavity is used to filter the air before it reaches the lungs?\n    - A: 75%\n    - B: 85%\n    - C: 95%\n    - D: 99%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which region at the back of the nose contains specialized neurons responsible for detecting smells?\n    - A: Olfactory tract\n    - B: Nasal cavity\n    - C: Olfactory epithelium\n    - D: Nostrils\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) How frequently are olfactory neurons replaced in the human body?\n    - A: Every 4-8 months\n    - B: Every 4-8 weeks\n    - C: Every 4-8 years\n    - D: They are not replaced\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the term for the inability to smell a particular scent?\n    - A: Anosmia\n    - B: Olfactory disorder\n    - C: Smell blindness\n    - D: Odor insensitivity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) Why do some pork producers castrate male pigs?\n    - A: To reduce aggression\n    - B: To improve meat quality\n    - C: To prevent the production of androstenone, a chemical that can give pork an unpleasant odor\n    - D: To increase fertility\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How does our sense of smell relate to our sense of taste?\n    - A: They are independent of each other\n    - B: Our sense of taste enhances our sense of smell\n    - C: Our sense of smell enhances our sense of taste by providing additional information about the flavor of food\n    - D: They are the same sense\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) Approximately how many different smells can an adult human distinguish?\n    - A: 5,000\n    - B: 8,000\n    - C: 10,000\n    - D: 50,000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) Where do the signals from the olfactory receptor cells travel to in the brain?\n    - A: Only to the amygdala\n    - B: Only to the thalamus\n    - C: To multiple destinations, including the amygdala, thalamus, and neocortex\n    - D: To the spinal cord\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is unique about the way smell signals are processed in the brain compared to sight and sound?\n    - A: Smell signals go to a relay center in the middle of the cerebral hemisphere\n    - B: Smell signals take a direct route to different regions of the brain\n    - C: Smell signals are processed only in the neocortex\n    - D: Smell signals are processed only in the amygdala\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can happen to a person's sense of taste if they lose their sense of smell?\n    - A: Their sense of taste becomes more sensitive\n    - B: Their sense of taste remains unaffected\n    - C: Their sense of taste is limited to detecting only the five basic tastes\n    - D: Their sense of taste becomes more complex\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo major refinements were needed, but I made minor adjustments to questions 1, 2, 6, and 7 to improve clarity and conciseness."
