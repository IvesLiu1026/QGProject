    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What method is used to analyze the element Amorium in the given setup?\n    - A: Infrared spectroscopy\n    - B: Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy\n    - C: Mass spectrometry\n    - D: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) In what year was Amorium first discovered as part of the Manhattan Project?\n    - A: 1942\n    - B: 1943\n    - C: 1944\n    - D: 1945\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why is Amorium used in smoke detectors?\n    - A: To detect changes in temperature\n    - B: To detect particles of smoke that intercept the radiation emitted by the element\n    - C: To detect changes in air pressure\n    - D: To detect the presence of carbon monoxide\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the primary objective of nuclear fuel reprocessing?\n    - A: To produce pure uranium and plutonium product streams\n    - B: To generate electricity from nuclear waste\n    - C: To reduce the amount of nuclear waste\n    - D: To increase the efficiency of nuclear reactors\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) What is a potential use of Amorium-241 in the field of space exploration?\n    - A: As a fuel source for rockets\n    - B: As an independent power source for spacecraft\n    - C: As a radiation shield for astronauts\n    - D: As a navigation system for spacecraft\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) Why is Amorium-241 being considered as an alternative to Plutonium-238?\n    - A: Because it is more expensive to produce\n    - B: Because it has a longer half-life\n    - C: Because the production of Plutonium-238 has stopped\n    - D: Because it is more readily available\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between Plutonium-241 and Amorium-241?\n    - A: Plutonium-241 decays into Amorium-241 with a half-life of 10 years\n    - B: Plutonium-241 decays into Amorium-241 with a half-life of 14 years\n    - C: Amorium-241 decays into Plutonium-241 with a half-life of 10 years\n    - D: Amorium-241 decays into Plutonium-241 with a half-life of 14 years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a notable challenge involved in synthesizing Amorium?\n    - A: The process requires high temperatures and pressures\n    - B: The process involves a complex series of chemical reactions\n    - C: The process was referred to as \"pandemonium\" due to its tedious nature\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What is a potential benefit of using Amorium-241 as an alternative power source?\n    - A: It has a higher energy density than Plutonium-238\n    - B: It is more readily available than Plutonium-238\n    - C: It can be used in smaller applications\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a potential risk associated with handling and using Amorium?\n    - A: Radiation exposure\n    - B: Chemical burns\n    - C: Explosions\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is a factor to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of Amorium as a replacement for Plutonium in batteries?\n    - A: The cost of production\n    - B: The energy density of the element\n    - C: The half-life of the element\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) Why is the European Space Agency interested in using Amorium-241 as a power source?\n    - A: Because it is more expensive to produce than Plutonium-238\n    - B: Because it has a longer half-life than Plutonium-238\n    - C: Because it can provide an independent power source for spacecraft\n    - D: Because it is more readily available than Plutonium-238\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions that were not directly related to the transcript or were too vague, and rephrased some questions to make them more concise and clear. I also made sure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect."
