    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the basic building blocks of polymers?\n    - A: Molecules\n    - B: Monomers\n    - C: Macromolecules\n    - D: Oligomers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Who developed the first synthetic polymer, Bakelite, in 1907?\n    - A: Leo Tolstoy\n    - B: Leo Baekeland\n    - C: Alexander Fleming\n    - D: Thomas Edison\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary difference between polymers made from a single monomer and those made from two monomers linked in a pattern?\n    - A: Molecular weight\n    - B: Structural roles\n    - C: Properties and complexity\n    - D: Genetic information\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the primary function of macromolecules, such as complex carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids?\n    - A: To provide energy\n    - B: To store genetic information or play structural roles\n    - C: To regulate body temperature\n    - D: To aid in digestion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What concept can be applied to develop new materials with specific properties, such as biodegradability and strength?\n    - A: Principles of physics\n    - B: Properties of polymers\n    - C: Laws of thermodynamics\n    - D: Materials science\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What factors should be considered when comparing the properties of different types of polymers?\n    - A: Molecular weight\n    - B: Environmental impact\n    - C: Structural complexity\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) How does the molecular weight of a polymer typically affect its properties?\n    - A: Molecular weight affects color\n    - B: Molecular weight affects strength or flexibility\n    - C: Molecular weight affects taste\n    - D: Molecular weight affects smell\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What could be a potential outcome of combining the concepts of polymers and biotechnology?\n    - A: Development of new medicines\n    - B: Development of biodegradable plastics or polymer-based biomaterials\n    - C: Development of new energy sources\n    - D: Development of new transportation systems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a potential benefit of integrating the study of polymers with other fields, such as materials science or biology?\n    - A: Increased environmental impact\n    - B: Decreased economic benefits\n    - C: Development of new understanding and applications\n    - D: Reduced social implications\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a key factor to consider when assessing the benefits and drawbacks of using synthetic polymers?\n    - A: Environmental impacts and effects on human health\n    - B: Economic benefits and social implications\n    - C: Structural complexity and molecular weight\n    - D: Color and texture\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a key factor to consider when justifying the use of polymers in specific applications?\n    - A: Environmental sustainability and social responsibility\n    - B: Economic benefits and structural complexity\n    - C: Molecular weight and color\n    - D: Texture and smell\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined question 12 (previously not included):\n12) What is a common issue with synthetic polymers, such as Styrofoam, in terms of their environmental impact?\n    - A: They biodegrade too quickly\n    - B: They are not durable enough\n    - C: They do not break down in the environment and can harm marine life\n    - D: They are too expensive to produce\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-11. However, I added a new question 12 to address the environmental impact of synthetic polymers, which is a key concept in the transcript."
