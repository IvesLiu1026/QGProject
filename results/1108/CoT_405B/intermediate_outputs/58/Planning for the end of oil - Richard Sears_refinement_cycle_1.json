    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the estimated amount of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world, according to the speaker?\n    - A: 50 trillion gallons\n    - B: 100 trillion gallons\n    - C: 200 trillion gallons\n    - D: 500 trillion gallons\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of the global energy supply did oil represent in 1985, according to the speaker?\n    - A: 30%\n    - B: 40%\n    - C: 50%\n    - D: 60%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the speaker's main argument regarding oil in the global energy system?\n    - A: Oil is running out and will soon be depleted.\n    - B: Oil is not running out, but its role in the global energy system is declining.\n    - C: Oil will continue to dominate the global energy system for the next century.\n    - D: Oil is not an important part of the global energy system.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the speaker's prediction about the future of energy systems?\n    - A: The world will continue to rely on fossil fuels.\n    - B: The world will move towards a more sustainable and carbon-free energy system.\n    - C: The world will experience a significant increase in energy consumption.\n    - D: The world will experience a significant decrease in energy consumption.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How does the speaker suggest we can apply the concept of decarbonization to various industries and sectors?\n    - A: By increasing their reliance on fossil fuels.\n    - B: By reducing their carbon footprint through the adoption of new technologies and practices.\n    - C: By ignoring the need for sustainability and environmental protection.\n    - D: By focusing solely on reducing energy consumption.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What potential application does the speaker identify for their ideas about the future of energy?\n    - A: The development of new energy technologies and policies.\n    - B: The increased use of fossil fuels in the global energy system.\n    - C: The abandonment of renewable energy sources.\n    - D: The reduction of energy consumption through conservation efforts.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What relationship does the speaker identify between the decline of oil and the rise of new energy sources?\n    - A: The decline of oil will lead to a decrease in the use of new energy sources.\n    - B: The decline of oil will lead to an increase in the use of new energy sources.\n    - C: The decline of oil will have no impact on the use of new energy sources.\n    - D: The rise of new energy sources will lead to an increase in the use of oil.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What example does the speaker use to illustrate the potential for new technologies?\n    - A: The example of the abalone shell.\n    - B: The example of the oil industry.\n    - C: The example of the renewable energy sector.\n    - D: The example of the fossil fuel industry.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What understanding does the speaker create by combining ideas about the future of energy, innovation, and technology?\n    - A: The world will continue to rely on fossil fuels.\n    - B: The world will move towards a more sustainable and carbon-free energy system.\n    - C: The world will experience a significant increase in energy consumption.\n    - D: The world will experience a significant decrease in energy consumption.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What understanding does the speaker create by synthesizing information about the properties of different materials?\n    - A: The potential for new technologies to be developed.\n    - B: The limitations of new technologies.\n    - C: The importance of fossil fuels in the global energy system.\n    - D: The insignificance of renewable energy sources.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is the speaker's evaluation of the role of oil in the global energy system?\n    - A: Oil will continue to dominate the global energy system.\n    - B: Oil is not an important part of the global energy system.\n    - C: The decline of oil is inevitable.\n    - D: The rise of new energy sources will lead to an increase in the use of oil.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the speaker's justification for the need for a more sustainable and carbon-free energy system?\n    - A: The need to reduce energy consumption.\n    - B: The need to increase energy production.\n    - C: The need to protect the environment and ensure sustainability.\n    - D: The need to reduce the cost of energy production.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to the wording and formatting of the questions to improve clarity and concision. I also reviewed the distractors to ensure they are plausible but incorrect. No significant changes were made to the questions, as they already align with the key concepts in the transcript."
