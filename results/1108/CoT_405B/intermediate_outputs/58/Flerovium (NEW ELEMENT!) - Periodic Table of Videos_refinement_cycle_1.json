    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the official name of element 114?\n    - A: Fleron\n    - B: Flerovium\n    - C: Florium\n    - D: Pluton\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Where were the experiments conducted to synthesize Flerovium?\n    - A: Russian Research Center in Moscow\n    - B: Russian Research Center in Dubna, north of Moscow\n    - C: International Research Center in Geneva\n    - D: European Research Center in Berlin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is expected to be similar between the chemistry of Flerovium and another element?\n    - A: The chemistry of Flerovium is expected to be similar to that of oxygen.\n    - B: The chemistry of Flerovium is expected to be similar to that of lead.\n    - C: The chemistry of Flerovium is expected to be similar to that of calcium.\n    - D: The chemistry of Flerovium is expected to be similar to that of radon.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the significance of the symbol for Flerovium in physics?\n    - A: It is used to create charts of chemical reactions.\n    - B: It is used to create charts of radioactive decay.\n    - C: It is used to create charts of atomic structures.\n    - D: It is used to create charts of nuclear stability.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a notable aspect of the discovery of Flerovium?\n    - A: It was discovered through nationalistic competition.\n    - B: It was discovered through international collaboration.\n    - C: It was discovered by a single researcher.\n    - D: It was discovered by accident.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can the study of Flerovium's properties inform our understanding of?\n    - A: The behavior of noble gases\n    - B: The behavior of superheavy elements\n    - C: The behavior of radioactive isotopes\n    - D: The behavior of chemical reactions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) Why is the symbol for Flerovium useful, despite the element's limited availability?\n    - A: It is useful for creating compounds.\n    - B: It is useful for creating charts of radioactive decay.\n    - C: It is useful for studying the element's chemical properties.\n    - D: It is useful for studying the element's physical properties.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) Why was Flerovium named after Georgy Flyorov?\n    - A: Because he was a Russian scientist\n    - B: Because he discovered the element\n    - C: Because he contributed significantly to science\n    - D: Because he was a famous physicist\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be formed by combining the discovery of Flerovium with the study of other superheavy elements?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the periodic table and the properties of these elements\n    - B: A new theory of chemical reactions\n    - C: A new method for synthesizing elements\n    - D: A new understanding of the behavior of noble gases\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can the international collaboration that led to the discovery of Flerovium be applied to?\n    - A: Other areas of scientific research, fostering global cooperation and advancing scientific knowledge\n    - B: Other areas of scientific research, promoting nationalistic competition and advancing scientific knowledge\n    - C: Other areas of industrial development, fostering global cooperation and advancing economic growth\n    - D: Other areas of environmental conservation, promoting nationalistic competition and advancing environmental protection\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How can the decision to name Flerovium after Georgy Flyorov be evaluated?\n    - A: As a fitting tribute to his contributions to science\n    - B: As an unnecessary gesture\n    - C: As a nationalistic move\n    - D: As a publicity stunt\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is a potential outcome of the discovery of Flerovium and other superheavy elements?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the periodic table and the properties of these elements\n    - B: The creation of new, lighter elements\n    - C: The development of new materials for industrial use\n    - D: The discovery of new, more stable elements\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 5 from the initial set, as it was not clear and concise, and replaced it with a new question. I also refined questions 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 to ensure they align with the key concepts and have plausible but incorrect distractors."
