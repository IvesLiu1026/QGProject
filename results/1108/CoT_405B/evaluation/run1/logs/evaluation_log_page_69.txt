Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The brain is the center of all of our thoughts, dreams, emotions, and memories. It's what makes us who we are. But, there is still a lot that we don't know about the brain. Scientists have worked for years on trying to understand the human brain using techniques like EEG and FMRI, where we scan the brain from the outside. But what if we could look inside the brains of humans and watch them as they work? Well, now we can by looking at the brains of people who are already going through surgery for clinical reasons, like curing epilepsy. Epilepsy is a disease in which a faulty part of the brain starts working spontaneously for no apparent reason. It's like an earthquake but inside your head. There's no way to know in advance when a seizure will occur, so the patients are always at risk of unexpectedly losing control. There are drugs that treat epilepsy, but these don't always work. Some patients who don't respond well to the drugs can undergo a different treatment where the faulty part in their brain, the part that starts the seizures, is surgically removed. The challenge is knowing which part to take out. How do you figure out which bit of the brain is faulty? In order to find the exact location of the seizure onset, doctors embed electrodes directly into the patient's brain around the suspected seizure center. The patient then stays in the hospital for a few days, waiting to have a seizure with the electrodes constantly recording the activity inside his or her brain. Yes, now we want the patient to have a seizure so doctors can use the embedded electrodes to measure it and learn exactly where its origin was. After doctors are sure where the seizures come from in the brain, they can take the electrodes out. Now they know what part of the brain they can remove in order to cure the patient. These brain electrodes can tell us more than just where the seizures happen. Based on where the doctors place the electrodes in the brain, we can ask questions about what the brain does. Sometimes we find one cell that starts bursting in activity every time the patient sees a particular picture, for example, a picture of Marilyn Monroe. See, every time the patient sees Marilyn Monroe, some specific cells fire in the brain. You can now know when the patient is thinking of Marilyn Monroe just by listening to these cells fire. When we find one or a few of these cells with each patient, we can then do all kinds of fancy things. For example, we can connect the recording electrode to a cursor on a screen and have the patient move the cursor left or right just by thinking of things. This can help people who lost the ability to move their hands, like people with spinal cord injuries or wounded soldiers, by having them control a prosthetic arm directly with their brain. Our brain is a brilliant device which can make predictions about the future. For example, we can all know which word will appear at the end of this... sentence. The brain can solve complicated problems, imagine the entire universe, and grasp concepts such as infinity or unicorns. The brain produces complex emotions like love or jealousy, it's what makes us creative and curious, and it can even contemplate about itself. And the brain is the organ we use to study the brain. I think that the brain is the most beautiful organ in our body, but then I ask myself, "Which organ is making me think that?"

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the brain being the center of various aspects of human experience. The most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 comes closest in terms of discussing the brain's complexity and current state of understanding.

However, if I had to choose a question that somewhat aligns with the ground truth MCQ's intent, I would choose Question 3's index, but with a note that it's not a perfect match.

A more suitable approach would be to acknowledge that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, I will provide the index as requested:

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The brain is the center of all of our thoughts, dreams, emotions, and memories. It's what makes us who we are. But, there is still a lot that we don't know about the brain. Scientists have worked for years on trying to understand the human brain using techniques like EEG and FMRI, where we scan the brain from the outside. But what if we could look inside the brains of humans and watch them as they work? Well, now we can by looking at the brains of people who are already going through surgery for clinical reasons, like curing epilepsy. Epilepsy is a disease in which a faulty part of the brain starts working spontaneously for no apparent reason. It's like an earthquake but inside your head. There's no way to know in advance when a seizure will occur, so the patients are always at risk of unexpectedly losing control. There are drugs that treat epilepsy, but these don't always work. Some patients who don't respond well to the drugs can undergo a different treatment where the faulty part in their brain, the part that starts the seizures, is surgically removed. The challenge is knowing which part to take out. How do you figure out which bit of the brain is faulty? In order to find the exact location of the seizure onset, doctors embed electrodes directly into the patient's brain around the suspected seizure center. The patient then stays in the hospital for a few days, waiting to have a seizure with the electrodes constantly recording the activity inside his or her brain. Yes, now we want the patient to have a seizure so doctors can use the embedded electrodes to measure it and learn exactly where its origin was. After doctors are sure where the seizures come from in the brain, they can take the electrodes out. Now they know what part of the brain they can remove in order to cure the patient. These brain electrodes can tell us more than just where the seizures happen. Based on where the doctors place the electrodes in the brain, we can ask questions about what the brain does. Sometimes we find one cell that starts bursting in activity every time the patient sees a particular picture, for example, a picture of Marilyn Monroe. See, every time the patient sees Marilyn Monroe, some specific cells fire in the brain. You can now know when the patient is thinking of Marilyn Monroe just by listening to these cells fire. When we find one or a few of these cells with each patient, we can then do all kinds of fancy things. For example, we can connect the recording electrode to a cursor on a screen and have the patient move the cursor left or right just by thinking of things. This can help people who lost the ability to move their hands, like people with spinal cord injuries or wounded soldiers, by having them control a prosthetic arm directly with their brain. Our brain is a brilliant device which can make predictions about the future. For example, we can all know which word will appear at the end of this... sentence. The brain can solve complicated problems, imagine the entire universe, and grasp concepts such as infinity or unicorns. The brain produces complex emotions like love or jealousy, it's what makes us creative and curious, and it can even contemplate about itself. And the brain is the organ we use to study the brain. I think that the brain is the most beautiful organ in our body, but then I ask myself, "Which organ is making me think that?"

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Normally astronaut training takes about one full year, and it includes such subjects as astronomy, astrophysics, flight physiology, orbital trajectories, or orbital management. Another part of the astronaut basic training is survival training. In the days of Gemini, you never knew for sure where a spacecraft might land if there was an emergency, deorbit. So, we had to take desert training, water training, and jungle survival training. So, we had to learn how to cook and eat snake and all other, such other good things as that, and how to make water in a desert. After that year and a half of astronaut basic training, our names were all put on a list and that list was quite a bit longer at that time then there were seats available. And so, we were all given other duties to keep us occupied and to help continue our training. Five of us were assigned to the lunar module, and our job was to be with these lunar modules as they were being built. So, we spent a lot of time there. I must admit that probably I had more time sleeping on the floor of Lunar Module #6 than the crew who flew it on the moon. Well, my next job was to be on the support crew of Apollo 8, and Apollo 8 was the spacecraft that flew to the moon and came back but did not land. When they went behind the moon, they were supposed to do a thrusting maneuver to slow them down so they would be captured into lunar orbit. So we just had to sit and cool our heels when they went behind the moon, and we knew if they came out a little early on the other side, that they had not burned enough, not slowed down enough, and were going to skip out into space, they wouldn't be captured in orbit. If they came out a little bit late, it meant they had over-done it, and they weren't going to be in orbit, but were going to begin a spiral down to the lunar surface. And, of course, without a lunar module, that kind of ruins your whole day. You can imagine how relieved we were at the instant that they were supposed to appear on the other side of the moon that they appeared! My next assignment was again a support crew assignment on Apollo 12, and Apollo 12 was struck by lightning on its way off the pad. A nearby thunderstorm, there was a lightning bolt that went over and hit the very tip of the spacecraft. The charge went down through the spacecraft, through the booster, down the exhaust gases, and grounded out on the launching pad. It killed the electrical power system and the computers all died. You can imagine what it must have been like for them inside because suddenly the lights all went out and then they came back on when the batteries picked up the load. And, every single warning light and caution light in the spacecraft was on and flashing, and all the necessary bells, whistles, and buzzards and things that are in there, all were going off at the same time. The crew was totally confused as to what was going on. When we were settled in orbit, we tested all the various systems and everything looked good. So, that, now I figured this is it, and sure enough, I did get an assignment, a flight assignment. I was assigned to the back-up crew of Apollo 16, which meant that I was to be on the param crew of Apollo 19. And, several weeks into the training, NASA made the surprise announcment that they were going to cancel Apollos 18, 19, and 20. We were in the middle of the Vietnam War, the budget was in bad shape, so you can imagine there were three very, very sad hangdog guys moping around the office because we lost our flight to the moon. But, several weeks later, I got a call from Tom Stafford, the Senior Astronaut at that time, and he wanted me in his office, and I went in, and he told me that he was sorry that I had missed my opportunity for the moon, but he said, "I've got another assignment for you." He said, "I want you to be the commander of the third and final Skylab mission." And, he said, "Do you think you could do the job?" And I said, "Of course, yes!" And, I'll have to admit, a certain lump in my chest and in my stomach, because I was a rookie, and they normally don't assign a rookie to be a commander, usually you have to have at least one flight under your belt, but they assigned me to that, which was really kind of a shock because the last rookie commander was Neil Armstrong on Gemini 8.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible reason for this mismatch.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a specific detail mentioned in the transcript, which is the type of animal that Carr was taught to cook during astronaut training. The generated MCQs, on the other hand, seem to focus on more general topics related to astronaut training, space missions, and leadership.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1, but only because it mentions astronaut training, which is the context in which Carr learned to cook a snake. However, the question intent, options, and content of Question 1 are not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the specific skills or experiences that Carr had during astronaut training, such as "What type of survival skills did Carr learn during astronaut training?" or "What unusual food did Carr learn to cook during astronaut training?". Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this type of question.

Therefore, I cannot provide an index of a matching generated MCQ.

After that year and a half of astronaut basic training, our names were all put on a list and that list was quite a bit longer at that time then there were seats available. And so, we were all given other duties to keep us occupied and to help continue our training. Five of us were assigned to the lunar module, and our job was to be with these lunar modules as they were being built. So, we spent a lot of time there. I must admit that probably I had more time sleeping on the floor of Lunar Module #6 than the crew who flew it on the moon. Well, my next job was to be on the support crew of Apollo 8, and Apollo 8 was the spacecraft that flew to the moon and came back but did not land. When they went behind the moon, they were supposed to do a thrusting maneuver to slow them down so they would be captured into lunar orbit. So we just had to sit and cool our heels when they went behind the moon, and we knew if they came out a little early on the other side, that they had not burned enough, not slowed down enough, and were going to skip out into space, they wouldn't be captured in orbit. If they came out a little bit late, it meant they had over-done it, and they weren't going to be in orbit, but were going to begin a spiral down to the lunar surface. And, of course, without a lunar module, that kind of ruins your whole day. You can imagine how relieved we were at the instant that they were supposed to appear on the other side of the moon that they appeared! My next assignment was again a support crew assignment on Apollo 12, and Apollo 12 was struck by lightning on its way off the pad. A nearby thunderstorm, there was a lightning bolt that went over and hit the very tip of the spacecraft. The charge went down through the spacecraft, through the booster, down the exhaust gases, and grounded out on the launching pad. It killed the electrical power system and the computers all died. You can imagine what it must have been like for them inside because suddenly the lights all went out and then they came back on when the batteries picked up the load. And, every single warning light and caution light in the spacecraft was on and flashing, and all the necessary bells, whistles, and buzzards and things that are in there, all were going off at the same time. The crew was totally confused as to what was going on. When we were settled in orbit, we tested all the various systems and everything looked good. So, that, now I figured this is it, and sure enough, I did get an assignment, a flight assignment. I was assigned to the back-up crew of Apollo 16, which meant that I was to be on the param crew of Apollo 19. And, several weeks into the training, NASA made the surprise announcment that they were going to cancel Apollos 18, 19, and 20. We were in the middle of the Vietnam War, the budget was in bad shape, so you can imagine there were three very, very sad hangdog guys moping around the office because we lost our flight to the moon. But, several weeks later, I got a call from Tom Stafford, the Senior Astronaut at that time, and he wanted me in his office, and I went in, and he told me that he was sorry that I had missed my opportunity for the moon, but he said, "I've got another assignment for you." He said, "I want you to be the commander of the third and final Skylab mission." And, he said, "Do you think you could do the job?" And I said, "Of course, yes!" And, I'll have to admit, a certain lump in my chest and in my stomach, because I was a rookie, and they normally don't assign a rookie to be a commander, usually you have to have at least one flight under your belt, but they assigned me to that, which was really kind of a shock because the last rookie commander was Neil Armstrong on Gemini 8.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the duration of time spent in space by Carr and his teammates, while the generated MCQs cover various topics related to astronaut training, space missions, and leadership.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would select Question 8: "What was the impact of the cancellation of Apollos 18, 19, and 20 on the speaker's career?" This question is related to the speaker's experience and career, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent or content.

Therefore, I must conclude that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ. If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 8 is the closest, but it is still not a good match.

Index: 8 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What do horror movies and comedies have in common? The two genres might seem totally different, but the reason they're both so popular is perhaps because what they have in common: their use of dramatic irony. First, let's clarify. There are three types of irony out there. Situational irony is when you expect one thing, but get the opposite. Verbal irony is when someone says something, but truly means the opposite. Dramatic irony, though, is what we will be looking at right now. Dramatic irony is when the audience seems to know more about an event, a situation, or a conversation than the characters in the movie, on the show, or in the book do. The audience is in on a secret that the characters have missed. This is a great story-telling device that creates tremendous emotion within that text. Think about it for a moment. How does it feel when, in a horror film, you know that the scary villain is hiding behind that door in the darkened room. The music becomes eerie, the lighting creates complete shadows, this has to be bad for the hero! Of course, though, that hero must enter the room to find the villain. You feel tremendous tension and the suspense of knowing that someone will jump out and be scary, but you just don't know when. That tension is dramatic irony: you know something more than the characters in the film. Now, take the typical comedy. There will probably be some type of "misunderstanding". Again, we know more of what is going on than the characters do. Picture two characters making a plan for a birthday surprise for their roommate while that roommate overhears the entire conversation from the hallway. From there, confusion and misunderstanding occur, and the tension builds. This isn't the same tension as the horror film since it is probably pretty funny as the character tries to figure out the whos and the whats, but it serves as a great example of the tension and suspense of dramatic irony. This tension or suspense in both genres drives the story and keeps the plot progressing. The audience wants, no, needs, to see the tension of the dramatic irony broken either by the scary person jumping out of the shadows or by someone finally revealing someone's true identity and clearing up the confusion. So, when you feel like you are in on a secret, that is dramatic irony, a hallmark of all the great writers, from Shakespeare to Hitchcock.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What do horror movies and comedies have in common? The two genres might seem totally different, but the reason they're both so popular is perhaps because what they have in common: their use of dramatic irony. First, let's clarify. There are three types of irony out there. Situational irony is when you expect one thing, but get the opposite. Verbal irony is when someone says something, but truly means the opposite. Dramatic irony, though, is what we will be looking at right now. Dramatic irony is when the audience seems to know more about an event, a situation, or a conversation than the characters in the movie, on the show, or in the book do. The audience is in on a secret that the characters have missed. This is a great story-telling device that creates tremendous emotion within that text. Think about it for a moment. How does it feel when, in a horror film, you know that the scary villain is hiding behind that door in the darkened room. The music becomes eerie, the lighting creates complete shadows, this has to be bad for the hero! Of course, though, that hero must enter the room to find the villain. You feel tremendous tension and the suspense of knowing that someone will jump out and be scary, but you just don't know when. That tension is dramatic irony: you know something more than the characters in the film. Now, take the typical comedy. There will probably be some type of "misunderstanding". Again, we know more of what is going on than the characters do. Picture two characters making a plan for a birthday surprise for their roommate while that roommate overhears the entire conversation from the hallway. From there, confusion and misunderstanding occur, and the tension builds. This isn't the same tension as the horror film since it is probably pretty funny as the character tries to figure out the whos and the whats, but it serves as a great example of the tension and suspense of dramatic irony. This tension or suspense in both genres drives the story and keeps the plot progressing. The audience wants, no, needs, to see the tension of the dramatic irony broken either by the scary person jumping out of the shadows or by someone finally revealing someone's true identity and clearing up the confusion. So, when you feel like you are in on a secret, that is dramatic irony, a hallmark of all the great writers, from Shakespeare to Hitchcock.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although the wording of the questions is different, both the ground truth MCQ and Question 1 aim to identify the common element between horror films and comedies. The ground truth MCQ asks what horror films and comedies have in common, while Question 1 asks about the literary device used in both genres to create tension and suspense. 

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. But if we had to choose one, Question 1 would be the closest match.

But since the options for Question 1 do not match the options for the ground truth MCQ, we should consider other questions. 

In this case, Question 4 is a better match because it also discusses the effects of dramatic irony (the common element) on the audience, similar to option C of the ground truth MCQ ("Both A and B"), which mentions building suspense and tension.

However, there is still no perfect match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of irony that is not a common type, and the correct answer is "Visual" irony, which is not mentioned in the transcript as a type of irony.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of discussing types of irony, but it does not ask about the type of irony that is not common. Instead, it asks about the literary device used in horror movies and comedies.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the discussion of types of irony, I would choose Question 2. This question discusses the definition of dramatic irony and provides options that include other types of irony (situational and verbal). Although it does not ask about the type of irony that is not common, it is the closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of discussing the different types of irony.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

Please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the question of which type of irony is not common.

staring at him because it was white folk only and they were looking at
him saying, you know, "Who is this negro?" So he politely positioned
himself in line to check out his books. Well, this old librarian,
she says, "This library's not
for coloreds." He said, "Well, I would like
to check out these books." She says, "Young man, if you don't leave this
library right now, I'm gonna call the police." So he just propped himself up
on the counter... (laughs) and sat there and said,
"I'll wait." So, she called the police and
subsequently called my mother. The police came down,
two burly guys, come in and say, "Well,
where's the disturbance?" She pointed to the little
nine year old boy sitting up on the counter. He says, "Ma'am,
what's the problem?" So my mother, in the meanwhile,
she was called and she comes down there
praying the whole way there, "Lordy, Jesus, please don't let
them put my child in jail." And my mother asked
the librarian, "What's the problem?" "He wanted to check out
the book. You know your son shouldn't
be down here." And the police officer said, "Why don't you just give
the kid the books?" And my mother said, "He'll
take good care of them." And reluctantly, the librarian
gave Ron the books. And my mother said,
"What do you say?" He said, "Thank you, ma'am."

"Star Trek." Now, Star Trek showed

science-possibility, you know. He came up during a time

South Carolina, wearing glasses, who never flew a plane, how was

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the outcome of the library where Ronald took books out of, and the correct answer is that it was renamed after Ronald in his honor.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is the most similar in terms of theme and intent. It asks about the episode of Ron's visit to the library and what it can be used to illustrate. While it does not directly ask about the outcome of the library, it is related to the story of Ron's visit to the library and the themes of standing up for one's rights and challenging societal norms.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, I would suggest Question 5. It asks about what the story of Ron's visit to the library can be applied to, and one of the options is discussions about racial segregation and the Civil Rights Movement. While it does not directly ask about the outcome of the library, it is related to the historical context and themes presented in the ground truth MCQ.

But since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index of the most similar generated MCQ.

If you would like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

♪♪ When he was
nine years old, Ron, without my parents or myself
knowing his whereabouts, decided to take a mile walk from
our home down to the library, which was, of course,
a public library, but not so public
for black folks when you're talking about 1959. So as he was walking in there, all these folks were
staring at him because it was white folk only and they were looking at
him saying, you know, "Who is this negro?" So he politely positioned
himself in line to check out his books. Well, this old librarian,
she says, "This library's not
for coloreds." He said, "Well, I would like
to check out these books." She says, "Young man, if you don't leave this
library right now, I'm gonna call the police." So he just propped himself up
on the counter... (laughs) and sat there and said,
"I'll wait." So, she called the police and
subsequently called my mother. The police came down,
two burly guys, come in and say, "Well,
where's the disturbance?" She pointed to the little
nine year old boy sitting up on the counter. He says, "Ma'am,
what's the problem?" So my mother, in the meanwhile,
she was called and she comes down there
praying the whole way there, "Lordy, Jesus, please don't let
them put my child in jail." And my mother asked
the librarian, "What's the problem?" "He wanted to check out
the book. You know your son shouldn't
be down here." And the police officer said, "Why don't you just give
the kid the books?" And my mother said, "He'll
take good care of them." And reluctantly, the librarian
gave Ron the books. And my mother said,
"What do you say?" He said, "Thank you, ma'am."
(laughs) Later on, as youngsters, a show came on TV called,
"Star Trek." Now, Star Trek showed
the future where there were black folk and white folk
working together, and I just looked at it
as science-fiction, because that wasn't gonna
happen, really. But Ronald saw it as
science-possibility, you know. He came up during a time
when there was Neil Armstrong
and all of those guys. So how was a colored boy from
South Carolina, wearing glasses, who never flew a plane, how was
he gonna become an astronaut? But Ron was the one
who didn't accept societal norms as
being his norm. That was for other people. And uh, he got to be aboard

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I would like to introduce you
to my favorite parasite. There are millions that I could choose from and this is it: it's called the jewel wasp. You can find it 
in parts of Africa and Asia. It's a little under an inch long, and it is a beautiful looking parasite. Now, you may be saying to yourself, "This is not a parasite. It's not a tapeworm, it's not a virus, how could a wasp be a parasite?" You are probably thinking 
about regular wasps, you know, the ones that build 
paper nests as their house. Well, the thing is that the jewel wasp makes its house inside 
a living cockroach. Here's how it happens. A jewel wasp is flying around, 
looking for a cockroach. When it sees one, it lands 
and bites on its wing. So, I'll be the cockroach. Be-wha! Bewha! And the cockroach starts shaking it off, "Get away from me!" The wasp very quickly starts
stinging the cockroach. All of a sudden, the cockroach can't move, for about a minute. And then it recovers and stands up. It could run away now, but it doesn't. It just doesn't want to. It just stays there. It's become a zombie slave. Again, I'm not making this up. The wasp goes off, it walks away and finds a hole and digs it out, makes it into a burrow. It walks back. This can take up to half an hour. The cockroach is still there. What do we do now? The wasps grabs onto one of the antenna, bites down on it, of the cockroach, and pulls the cockroach. And the cockroach says, "Alright," and walks like a dog on a leash. The wasp takes it 
all the way down into the burrow. The cockroach says, "Nice place." The wasp takes care of some business and then goes and leaves the burrow and seals it shut, leaving the cockroach entombed 
in darkness, still alive. The cockroach says, "Alright, 
I'll stay here if you want." Now, I mentioned that 
the cockroach took care, ah, the wasp took care 
of a little business before it left the burrow. The business was laying an egg on the underside of the cockroach. The egg hatches. Out comes a wasp larva. It looks kind of like 
a maggot with big, nasty jaws. It chews a hole into the cockroach and starts to feed from the outside. It gets bigger, 
like you can see over here. And then when it gets big enough, it decides to crawl into the hole, into the cockroach. So now it's inside 
the still-living cockroach and the cockroach doesn't mind much. This goes on for about a month. The larva grows and grows and grows, then makes a pupa, 
kind of like a cocoon. Inside there it grows eyes, it grows wings, it grows legs, the cockroach is still alive, 
still waiting. Finally the wasp is ready to leave, and that's when the cockroach finally dies because the fullly-formed adult wasp crawls out of the cockroach's dying body. The wasp shakes itself off, climbs out of the burrow, goes and finds another wasp to mate with to start this whole, crazy cycle again. So, this is not science fiction, this happens every day, 
all over the world. And scientists are 
totally fascinated by this. They're just starting to figure out
how all this happens. And, when you really start 
to look at the science of it, you start to kind of respect 
this very creepy wasp. You see, the thing is that 
when it attacks the cockroach, it's not just stinging wildly, it delivers two precise stings. It knows this cockroach's nervous system like you know the back of your hand. The first sting goes to that spot there, called the "walking rhythm generators," and, as you can guess, those are the neurons that send signals to the legs to move. It blocks the channels 
that the neurons use to send these signals. So the cockroach wants to go, 
it wants to run away, but it can't because 
it can't move its legs. And that lasted for about a minute. This is really sophisticated pharmacology. We actually use the same method, a drug called Ivermectin, to cure river blindness, which is caused by a parasitic worm that gets into your eye. If you take Ivermectin, 
you paralyze the worm using the same strategy. Now, we discovered this in the 1970s, the wasp has been doing this for millions of years. Then comes the second sting. Now the second sting actually hits two places along the way. And to try to imagine how this can happen, I want you to picture yourself with a friend who's got a very long, very, very scary looking needle. And your friend, or at least you thought he was your friend, sticks it in your neck, goes into your skull, stops off at one part of your brain and injects some drugs, then keeps going in your brain and injects some more. These are two particular spots, marked here, "SEG", and you can see the tip of it in the brain, marked "Br". Now, we can do this, but it's really hard for us. It's called stereotactic drug delivery. You have to put a patient in a big metal frame to hold them still, you need CAT Scans to know where you're going, so you look at the picture and say, "Are we going the right way?" The jewel wasp has sensors on its stinger and scientists think that it can actually feel its way through the cockroach's brain until it gets to the exact, right place, and then penetrates an individual neuron and then delivers the goods. So, this is quite amazing stuff, and what seems to happen then is that the wasp is taking away the control that the cockroach has over its own body. It's taking away the cockroach's free will. We didn't really appreciate that cockroaches have free will until this wasp showed us. And, we have no idea how it's doing this, we don't know yet what the venom has in it and we don't know which circuits it's hitting in the cockroach's brain, and I think that's why this is, most of all, my favorite parasite because we have so much left to learn from it. Thank you very much.

still waiting. Finally the wasp is ready to leave, and that's when the cockroach finally dies because the fullly-formed adult wasp crawls out of the cockroach's dying body. The wasp shakes itself off, climbs out of the burrow, goes and finds another wasp to mate with to start this whole, crazy cycle again. So, this is not science fiction, this happens every day, 
all over the world. And scientists are 
totally fascinated by this. They're just starting to figure out
how all this happens. And, when you really start 
to look at the science of it, you start to kind of respect 
this very creepy wasp. You see, the thing is that 
when it attacks the cockroach, it's not just stinging wildly, it delivers two precise stings. It knows this cockroach's nervous system like you know the back of your hand. The first sting goes to that spot there, called the "walking rhythm generators," and, as you can guess, those are the neurons that send signals to the legs to move. It blocks the channels 
that the neurons use to send these signals. So the cockroach wants to go, 
it wants to run away, but it can't because 
it can't move its legs. And that lasted for about a minute. This is really sophisticated pharmacology. We actually use the same method, a drug called Ivermectin, to cure river blindness, which is caused by a parasitic worm that gets into your eye. If you take Ivermectin, 
you paralyze the worm using the same strategy. Now, we discovered this in the 1970s, the wasp has been doing this for millions of years. Then comes the second sting. Now the second sting actually hits two places along the way. And to try to imagine how this can happen, I want you to picture yourself with a friend who's got a very long, very, very scary looking needle. And your friend, or at least you thought he was your friend, sticks it in your neck, goes into your skull, stops off at one part of your brain and injects some drugs, then keeps going in your brain and injects some more. These are two particular spots, marked here, "SEG", and you can see the tip of it in the brain, marked "Br". Now, we can do this, but it's really hard for us. It's called stereotactic drug delivery. You have to put a patient in a big metal frame to hold them still, you need CAT Scans to know where you're going, so you look at the picture and say, "Are we going the right way?" The jewel wasp has sensors on its stinger and scientists think that it can actually feel its way through the cockroach's brain until it gets to the exact, right place, and then penetrates an individual neuron and then delivers the goods. So, this is quite amazing stuff, and what seems to happen then is that the wasp is taking away the control that the cockroach has over its own body. It's taking away the cockroach's free will. We didn't really appreciate that cockroaches have free will until this wasp showed us. And, we have no idea how it's doing this, we don't know yet what the venom has in it and we don't know which circuits it's hitting in the cockroach's brain, and I think that's why this is, most of all, my favorite parasite because we have so much left to learn from it. Thank you very much.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I would like to introduce you
to my favorite parasite. There are millions that I could choose from and this is it: it's called the jewel wasp. You can find it 
in parts of Africa and Asia. It's a little under an inch long, and it is a beautiful looking parasite. Now, you may be saying to yourself, "This is not a parasite. It's not a tapeworm, it's not a virus, how could a wasp be a parasite?" You are probably thinking 
about regular wasps, you know, the ones that build 
paper nests as their house. Well, the thing is that the jewel wasp makes its house inside 
a living cockroach. Here's how it happens. A jewel wasp is flying around, 
looking for a cockroach. When it sees one, it lands 
and bites on its wing. So, I'll be the cockroach. Be-wha! Bewha! And the cockroach starts shaking it off, "Get away from me!" The wasp very quickly starts
stinging the cockroach. All of a sudden, the cockroach can't move, for about a minute. And then it recovers and stands up. It could run away now, but it doesn't. It just doesn't want to. It just stays there. It's become a zombie slave. Again, I'm not making this up. The wasp goes off, it walks away and finds a hole and digs it out, makes it into a burrow. It walks back. This can take up to half an hour. The cockroach is still there. What do we do now? The wasps grabs onto one of the antenna, bites down on it, of the cockroach, and pulls the cockroach. And the cockroach says, "Alright," and walks like a dog on a leash. The wasp takes it 
all the way down into the burrow. The cockroach says, "Nice place." The wasp takes care of some business and then goes and leaves the burrow and seals it shut, leaving the cockroach entombed 
in darkness, still alive. The cockroach says, "Alright, 
I'll stay here if you want." Now, I mentioned that 
the cockroach took care, ah, the wasp took care 
of a little business before it left the burrow. The business was laying an egg on the underside of the cockroach. The egg hatches. Out comes a wasp larva. It looks kind of like 
a maggot with big, nasty jaws. It chews a hole into the cockroach and starts to feed from the outside. It gets bigger, 
like you can see over here. And then when it gets big enough, it decides to crawl into the hole, into the cockroach. So now it's inside 
the still-living cockroach and the cockroach doesn't mind much. This goes on for about a month. The larva grows and grows and grows, then makes a pupa, 
kind of like a cocoon. Inside there it grows eyes, it grows wings, it grows legs, the cockroach is still alive,

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: What is an example of a complex and highly evolved adaptation exhibited by the jewel wasp?**
Options: A. Its ability to fly, B. Its ability to sting, C. Its ability to take control of the cockroach's movements and behavior, D. Its ability to camouflage
Correct Option: C

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that specifically asks about how the wasp makes the cockroach move.

A more suitable match would be a question that is not present in the list of generated MCQs. If I had to choose from the existing options, I would say that **Question 8** is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match.

If I had to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

**New Question: How does the jewel wasp make the cockroach follow it?**
Options: A. The wasp bites down onto the cockroach's antennae, B. The wasp secretes a trail of pheromones that are irresistible to the cockroach, C. The cockroach follows the wasp without any persuasion from the wasp, D. The cockroach never follows the wasp -- the wasp simply lays its eggs while the cockroach is doing its own thing
Correct Option: A

This new question matches the ground truth MCQ more closely. However, since this question is not present in the list of generated MCQs, I will stick with my initial answer and say that **Question 8** is the closest match, although it's not a perfect match.

how all this happens. And, when you really start 
to look at the science of it, you start to kind of respect 
this very creepy wasp. You see, the thing is that 
when it attacks the cockroach, it's not just stinging wildly, it delivers two precise stings. It knows this cockroach's nervous system like you know the back of your hand. The first sting goes to that spot there, called the "walking rhythm generators," and, as you can guess, those are the neurons that send signals to the legs to move. It blocks the channels 
that the neurons use to send these signals. So the cockroach wants to go, 
it wants to run away, but it can't because 
it can't move its legs. And that lasted for about a minute. This is really sophisticated pharmacology. We actually use the same method, a drug called Ivermectin, to cure river blindness, which is caused by a parasitic worm that gets into your eye. If you take Ivermectin, 
you paralyze the worm using the same strategy. Now, we discovered this in the 1970s, the wasp has been doing this for millions of years. Then comes the second sting. Now the second sting actually hits two places along the way. And to try to imagine how this can happen, I want you to picture yourself with a friend who's got a very long, very, very scary looking needle. And your friend, or at least you thought he was your friend, sticks it in your neck, goes into your skull, stops off at one part of your brain and injects some drugs, then keeps going in your brain and injects some more. These are two particular spots, marked here, "SEG", and you can see the tip of it in the brain, marked "Br". Now, we can do this, but it's really hard for us. It's called stereotactic drug delivery. You have to put a patient in a big metal frame to hold them still, you need CAT Scans to know where you're going, so you look at the picture and say, "Are we going the right way?" The jewel wasp has sensors on its stinger and scientists think that it can actually feel its way through the cockroach's brain until it gets to the exact, right place, and then penetrates an individual neuron and then delivers the goods. So, this is quite amazing stuff, and what seems to happen then is that the wasp is taking away the control that the cockroach has over its own body. It's taking away the cockroach's free will. We didn't really appreciate that cockroaches have free will until this wasp showed us. And, we have no idea how it's doing this, we don't know yet what the venom has in it and we don't know which circuits it's hitting in the cockroach's brain, and I think that's why this is, most of all, my favorite parasite because we have so much left to learn from it. Thank you very much.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the provided options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what moves into the cockroach, and the correct option is that the wasp larva feeds from the outside until it's big/strong enough to move inside.

A generated MCQ that has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 7: What type of relationship exists between the jewel wasp and the cockroach? 
Options: A. Symbiotic, B. Parasitic, C. Mutualistic, D. Commensal 
Correct Option: B

However, this question does not directly ask about what moves into the cockroach.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose:

Question 8: What is an example of a complex and highly evolved adaptation exhibited by the jewel wasp? 
Options: A. Its ability to fly, B. Its ability to sting, C. Its ability to take control of the cockroach's movements and behavior, D. Its ability to camouflage 
Correct Option: C

This question is related to the jewel wasp's behavior and its interaction with the cockroach, but it does not directly ask about what moves into the cockroach.

Since there is no generated MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that asks about what moves into the cockroach, with options similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to provide an index of the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it is Question 8, with the understanding that it is not a direct match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the rate at which the average lifespan is increasing, which is mentioned in the transcript as "currently at the rate of about 5 hours every day".

Among the generated MCQs, none of them directly ask about the rate of increase in average lifespan. However, I can try to find one that is related to the topic of aging or lifespan.

After reviewing the generated MCQs, I found that none of them are closely related to the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 7 is the closest, as it talks about the relationship between aging and the increased risk of neurologic diseases. However, it's not a good match, as it doesn't mention the rate of increase in average lifespan.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not available. However, if I had to choose one, I would say:

Index: Not Available (or 7, but it's not a good match)

Please note that the generated MCQs are not closely related to the ground truth MCQ, and it's not possible to find a good match.

Although this question does not directly ask what puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips, it does discuss the benefits of great creativity, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ. However, upon closer inspection, I realize that this is not the best match.

A better match would be a question that directly asks about the characteristics or actions of great creativity. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about this specific aspect of great creativity.

However, I can suggest an alternative approach to find a match. Since the ground truth MCQ asks about what puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips, and the correct answer is "Great creativity", I can look for a generated MCQ that discusses the role of great creativity in influencing people's thoughts and actions.

With this approach, I have identified a new match:

**Question 7: What is the relationship between great creativity and its ability to influence people's thoughts and actions?**

Although this question does not directly ask what puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips, it does discuss the influence of great creativity on people's thoughts and actions, which is related to the idea of putting slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips.

However, I must admit that this is still not a perfect match.

If I had to choose one of the generated MCQs as the most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose:

**Question 5: How can creativity be used to inspire people to adopt environmentally friendly habits?**

This question discusses the role of creativity in inspiring people, which is related to the idea of putting slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips. However, the context is different, as this question focuses on environmental habits rather than the general influence of great creativity.

In conclusion, I apologize for not being able to find a perfect match among the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose one, I would choose **Question 5** as the most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I got in my first car accident when I was sixteen. I had just gotten my license and I was driving home when a car pulled into the intersection and bang! It hit me. It had happened that quick. Bang! But when I play that memory back, it doesn't take two seconds. I see the tires of the car rolling through the stop sign, I have time to think, "You know, I think that car is going to hit me." I see the right-hand corner of the hood crumple up like tin foil, I see the red paint flake off and drift off into the air, I can see all of that, like it's happening in slow motion. In my memory, that experience takes ten seconds. But why? Why did that memory play back longer than the actual time it took? This is an interesting phenomenon and it's not just for car accidents, a roller coaster, or a first kiss. These events seem to take longer than they actually take. But why? And when it comes to writing about that experience, how do I get that peculiar feeling across? How do I slow down time as a writer? To get the answer, we have to visit Hollywood. You see, the way filmmakers create slow motion will tell us a lot about how writers can create slow motion. First, let's remember how film works. When the camera turns on, it's not recording motion, it's taking lots and lots of individual pictures. Then when those pictures are played back in the projector, they blend together and create the appearance of motion, like a flip book. So, let's imagine that a camera man needs to film his actress skipping through a field of daisies in regular motion. Ready, action. She skips across the field, he records it, and...cut. Let's say for the sake of easy math that our camera man took 50 pictures, 50 little frames on that length of film. Now, let's take that film and play it back at the rate of 50 frames per 5 seconds. This rate is constant, the projector will always go at the same speed. It's easy, we got 50 frames, so our film takes 5 seconds. She skips across the field... ...and cut! So, then, how do we slow down time in film? How do we create slow motion? Maybe this is a surprise, but we don't take less pictures, we take more pictures. Ready, action! She skips across the field, he records it, and cut. Now we have a lot of film, a long length, let's say 100 frames long. Now, when we play it back, it takes a longer time to get through, and there's the actress in slow motion. Skipping through the field of daisies! Which brings us now to writing. When you're writing a narrative, you may want to use slow motion in one of your scenes. It's a cool effect, just like it is in Hollywood, and it draws the reader's attention to important moments. Well, here's how you do it. You see, when we read, our brain makes the words into pictures and the pictures blend into action. So what we read is what we see in the time it takes us to read it. For example, imagine you're writing a narrative about your game-winning free throw in the championship game. Here's a moment as a writer that you might want to slow down time to really capture the second-by-second tension produced by the scene. You concentrate, you put the pencil to paper, you really want to slow down time, you write, "I shot the ball in the hoop. Time slowed down. Then we won." To read that, takes two seconds; therefore, your reader imagines a scene that takes two seconds. Ball goes up, comes down, done. See, even though you wrote, "time slowed down," you didn't achieve that effect for your reader. Just saying it doesn't make it happen. Now, let's take what we make about film, time slows down with more pictures, and try again. This time write A LOT more. "I bent my knees and held the ball loosely. Letting the ball bounce on the floor once more, I gathered my thoughts. This was the moment. My right arm extended as I released the ball with a gentle flick, it rotated slightly as it arched toward the rim. I held my breath. The ball nudged the back rim, falling through the net with a gentle, satisfying swish. And the crowd exploded from their seats." See, we just slowed down time through our writing. The bottom line is this: there are moments in life that take longer than they actually take. When you're planning out your narrative, think about those moments, those snippets of life that took longer than the watch: the moment of hearing bad news, the moment of hearing good news, the moment of exhilaration when you realize you hit the jump, or the moment when you realize you aren't going to land it. Once you identify these moments in your narrative, you can use this effect of slow motion when you write. Just remember, it's not enough to say, "time slowed down" and it's not enough to throw a couple adjectives in a sentence and call it done either. Descriptive writing is good writing, that's true. But if you want to express the feeling of slow motion in life, you have to actually take up more physical space on the page, use more film so to speak. In doing so, you will create tension and keep your reader interested. And that way, the next time you write, you'll control the camera of your own writing.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I got in my first car accident when I was sixteen. I had just gotten my license and I was driving home when a car pulled into the intersection and bang! It hit me. It had happened that quick. Bang! But when I play that memory back, it doesn't take two seconds. I see the tires of the car rolling through the stop sign, I have time to think, "You know, I think that car is going to hit me." I see the right-hand corner of the hood crumple up like tin foil, I see the red paint flake off and drift off into the air, I can see all of that, like it's happening in slow motion. In my memory, that experience takes ten seconds. But why? Why did that memory play back longer than the actual time it took? This is an interesting phenomenon and it's not just for car accidents, a roller coaster, or a first kiss. These events seem to take longer than they actually take. But why? And when it comes to writing about that experience, how do I get that peculiar feeling across? How do I slow down time as a writer? To get the answer, we have to visit Hollywood. You see, the way filmmakers create slow motion will tell us a lot about how writers can create slow motion. First, let's remember how film works. When the camera turns on, it's not recording motion, it's taking lots and lots of individual pictures. Then when those pictures are played back in the projector, they blend together and create the appearance of motion, like a flip book. So, let's imagine that a camera man needs to film his actress skipping through a field of daisies in regular motion. Ready, action. She skips across the field, he records it, and...cut. Let's say for the sake of easy math that our camera man took 50 pictures, 50 little frames on that length of film. Now, let's take that film and play it back at the rate of 50 frames per 5 seconds. This rate is constant, the projector will always go at the same speed. It's easy, we got 50 frames, so our film takes 5 seconds. She skips across the field... ...and cut! So, then, how do we slow down time in film? How do we create slow motion? Maybe this is a surprise, but we don't take less pictures, we take more pictures. Ready, action! She skips across the field, he records it, and cut. Now we have a lot of film, a long length, let's say 100 frames long. Now, when we play it back, it takes a longer time to get through, and there's the actress in slow motion. Skipping through the field of daisies! Which brings us now to writing. When you're writing a narrative, you may want to use slow motion in one of your scenes. It's a cool effect, just like it is in Hollywood, and it draws the reader's attention to important moments. Well, here's how you do it. You see, when we read, our brain makes the words into pictures and the pictures blend into action. So what we read is what we see in the time it takes us to read it. For example, imagine you're writing a narrative about your game-winning free throw in the championship game. Here's a moment as a writer that you might want to slow down time to really capture the second-by-second tension produced by the scene. You concentrate, you put the pencil to paper, you really want to slow down time, you write, "I shot the ball in the hoop. Time slowed down. Then we won." To read that, takes two seconds; therefore, your reader imagines a scene that takes two seconds. Ball goes up, comes down, done. See, even though you wrote, "time slowed down," you didn't achieve that effect for your reader. Just saying it doesn't make it happen. Now, let's take what we make about film, time slows down with more pictures, and try again. This time write A LOT more. "I bent my knees and held the ball loosely. Letting the ball bounce on the floor once more, I gathered my thoughts. This was the moment. My right arm extended as I released the ball with a gentle flick, it rotated slightly as it arched toward the rim. I held my breath. The ball nudged the back rim, falling through the net with a gentle, satisfying swish. And the crowd exploded from their seats." See, we just slowed down time through our writing. The bottom line is this: there are moments in life that take longer than they actually take. When you're planning out your narrative, think about those moments, those snippets of life that took longer than the watch: the moment of hearing bad news, the moment of hearing good news, the moment of exhilaration when you realize you hit the jump, or the moment when you realize you aren't going to land it. Once you identify these moments in your narrative, you can use this effect of slow motion when you write. Just remember, it's not enough to say, "time slowed down" and it's not enough to throw a couple adjectives in a sentence and call it done either. Descriptive writing is good writing, that's true. But if you want to express the feeling of slow motion in life, you have to actually take up more physical space on the page, use more film so to speak. In doing so, you will create tension and keep your reader interested. And that way, the next time you write, you'll control the camera of your own writing.

I see the tires of the car rolling through the stop sign, I have time to think, "You know, I think that car is going to hit me."

You see, the way filmmakers create slow motion will tell us a lot about how writers can create slow motion. First, let's remember how film works. When the camera turns on, it's not recording motion, it's taking lots and lots of individual pictures. Then when those pictures are played back in the projector, they blend together and create the appearance of motion, like a flip book.

This rate is constant, the projector will always go at the same speed. It's easy, we got 50 frames, so our film takes 5 seconds. She skips across the field... ...and cut! So, then, how do we slow down time in film? How do we create slow motion? Maybe this is a surprise, but we don't take less pictures, we take more pictures. Ready, action! She skips across the field, he records it, and cut. Now we have a lot of film, a long length, let's say 100 frames long. Now, when we play it back, it takes a longer time to get through, and there's the actress in slow motion. Skipping through the field of daisies! Which brings us now to writing. When you're writing a narrative, you may want to use slow motion in one of your scenes. It's a cool effect, just like it is in Hollywood, and it draws the reader's attention to important moments. Well, here's how you do it. You see, when we read, our brain makes the words into pictures and the pictures blend into action. So what we read is what we see in the time it takes us to read it.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I got in my first car accident when I was sixteen. I had just gotten my license and I was driving home when a car pulled into the intersection and bang! It hit me. It had happened that quick. Bang! But when I play that memory back, it doesn't take two seconds. I see the tires of the car rolling through the stop sign, I have time to think, "You know, I think that car is going to hit me." I see the right-hand corner of the hood crumple up like tin foil, I see the red paint flake off and drift off into the air, I can see all of that, like it's happening in slow motion. In my memory, that experience takes ten seconds. But why? Why did that memory play back longer than the actual time it took? This is an interesting phenomenon and it's not just for car accidents, a roller coaster, or a first kiss. These events seem to take longer than they actually take. But why? And when it comes to writing about that experience, how do I get that peculiar feeling across? How do I slow down time as a writer? To get the answer, we have to visit Hollywood. You see, the way filmmakers create slow motion will tell us a lot about how writers can create slow motion. First, let's remember how film works. When the camera turns on, it's not recording motion, it's taking lots and lots of individual pictures. Then when those pictures are played back in the projector, they blend together and create the appearance of motion, like a flip book. So, let's imagine that a camera man needs to film his actress skipping through a field of daisies in regular motion. Ready, action. She skips across the field, he records it, and...cut. Let's say for the sake of easy math that our camera man took 50 pictures, 50 little frames on that length of film. Now, let's take that film and play it back at the rate of 50 frames per 5 seconds. This rate is constant, the projector will always go at the same speed. It's easy, we got 50 frames, so our film takes 5 seconds. She skips across the field... ...and cut! So, then, how do we slow down time in film? How do we create slow motion? Maybe this is a surprise, but we don't take less pictures, we take more pictures. Ready, action! She skips across the field, he records it, and cut. Now we have a lot of film, a long length, let's say 100 frames long. Now, when we play it back, it takes a longer time to get through, and there's the actress in slow motion. Skipping through the field of daisies! Which brings us now to writing. When you're writing a narrative, you may want to use slow motion in one of your scenes. It's a cool effect, just like it is in Hollywood, and it draws the reader's attention to important moments. Well, here's how you do it. You see, when we read, our brain makes the words into pictures and the pictures blend into action. So what we read is what we see in the time it takes us to read it. For example, imagine you're writing a narrative about your game-winning free throw in the championship game. Here's a moment as a writer that you might want to slow down time to really capture the second-by-second tension produced by the scene. You concentrate, you put the pencil to paper, you really want to slow down time, you write, "I shot the ball in the hoop. Time slowed down. Then we won." To read that, takes two seconds; therefore, your reader imagines a scene that takes two seconds. Ball goes up, comes down, done. See, even though you wrote, "time slowed down," you didn't achieve that effect for your reader. Just saying it doesn't make it happen. Now, let's take what we make about film, time slows down with more pictures, and try again. This time write A LOT more. "I bent my knees and held the ball loosely. Letting the ball bounce on the floor once more, I gathered my thoughts. This was the moment. My right arm extended as I released the ball with a gentle flick, it rotated slightly as it arched toward the rim. I held my breath. The ball nudged the back rim, falling through the net with a gentle, satisfying swish. And the crowd exploded from their seats." See, we just slowed down time through our writing. The bottom line is this: there are moments in life that take longer than they actually take. When you're planning out your narrative, think about those moments, those snippets of life that took longer than the watch: the moment of hearing bad news, the moment of hearing good news, the moment of exhilaration when you realize you hit the jump, or the moment when you realize you aren't going to land it. Once you identify these moments in your narrative, you can use this effect of slow motion when you write. Just remember, it's not enough to say, "time slowed down" and it's not enough to throw a couple adjectives in a sentence and call it done either. Descriptive writing is good writing, that's true. But if you want to express the feeling of slow motion in life, you have to actually take up more physical space on the page, use more film so to speak. In doing so, you will create tension and keep your reader interested. And that way, the next time you write, you'll control the camera of your own writing.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What does "going viral" on the internet really mean, and why does it happen so quickly? Why is a financial institution too big to fail? How does a virus in Africa end up in the United States in a matter of hours? Why are Facebook and Google such powerful companies at creating global connections? Well, in a word: networks. But what are networks? Everyone knows about their social network, but there are all different kinds of networks you probably haven't thought about. Networks are collections of links which combine by specific rules and behaviors if they are alive. We say that networks are alive because they are in constant change. Over time, the connections within a network migrate and concentrate in new places, forming evolving structures. How the evolution and concentration of constantly changing connections occurs is the subject of a whole discipline called network theory. We can think of networks as neighborhoods. Neighborhoods are defined by maps. A Google map demonstrates the relationship between locations in exactly the same fashion a network connects hubs and nodes, using streets as links to connect neighborhoods. The reason a network can expand and evolve so quickly is based upon a mathematical concept called power functions. A power function is a mathematical amplification mechanism, which over specific and very small ranges, accelerates changes logarithmically. That is, a very small change in one parameter produces a huge change in another over a very specific range of values. An example of how network structure emerges is the algorithm used by Google. As the number of links around a search term, say "friends", increases, connections begin to form among millions of different searches using the term "friend". What Google has cleverly accomplished is a real-time mathematical model for how to predict the emergence of growing connections among billions of search terms. The algorithm Google derived collects the number of references to any search object. As references to a search object increase, the number of links also increases, creating a node. As the node increases in size, it eventually becomes a hub, which links to many nodes. Networks will continue to emerge as new ways of connecting and creating neighborhoods are defined. Perhaps you can begin to see why networks are so powerful. As Google continues to collect the billions of daily searches, new clusters of links will rapidly emerge, forming additional and growing networks. Despite the logarithmic expansion of your network, the laws of six degrees of separation still apply. Therefore, if you explore a close friend or acquaintances in you Facebook network, everyone on average will be separated by six individuals or less and a map of your social network will create neighborhoods linked by common connections among friends.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the wording is different, both questions address the concept of networks being dynamic and constantly changing. The ground truth MCQ asks why networks are considered "alive," while Question 8 asks how the structure of a network influences its growth, with the correct option stating that the structure influences growth through the rules and behaviors that govern connections, implying change over time.

However, a more suitable match could be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the concept of networks being "alive" due to their constant change. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ's wording and intent.

If I had to choose the most similar one based on the concept of change and evolution in networks, I would suggest Question 8, but keep in mind that it is not a perfect match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What does "going viral" on the internet really mean, and why does it happen so quickly? Why is a financial institution too big to fail? How does a virus in Africa end up in the United States in a matter of hours? Why are Facebook and Google such powerful companies at creating global connections? Well, in a word: networks. But what are networks? Everyone knows about their social network, but there are all different kinds of networks you probably haven't thought about. Networks are collections of links which combine by specific rules and behaviors if they are alive. We say that networks are alive because they are in constant change. Over time, the connections within a network migrate and concentrate in new places, forming evolving structures. How the evolution and concentration of constantly changing connections occurs is the subject of a whole discipline called network theory. We can think of networks as neighborhoods. Neighborhoods are defined by maps. A Google map demonstrates the relationship between locations in exactly the same fashion a network connects hubs and nodes, using streets as links to connect neighborhoods. The reason a network can expand and evolve so quickly is based upon a mathematical concept called power functions. A power function is a mathematical amplification mechanism, which over specific and very small ranges, accelerates changes logarithmically. That is, a very small change in one parameter produces a huge change in another over a very specific range of values. An example of how network structure emerges is the algorithm used by Google. As the number of links around a search term, say "friends", increases, connections begin to form among millions of different searches using the term "friend". What Google has cleverly accomplished is a real-time mathematical model for how to predict the emergence of growing connections among billions of search terms. The algorithm Google derived collects the number of references to any search object. As references to a search object increase, the number of links also increases, creating a node. As the node increases in size, it eventually becomes a hub, which links to many nodes. Networks will continue to emerge as new ways of connecting and creating neighborhoods are defined. Perhaps you can begin to see why networks are so powerful. As Google continues to collect the billions of daily searches, new clusters of links will rapidly emerge, forming additional and growing networks. Despite the logarithmic expansion of your network, the laws of six degrees of separation still apply. Therefore, if you explore a close friend or acquaintances in you Facebook network, everyone on average will be separated by six individuals or less and a map of your social network will create neighborhoods linked by common connections among friends.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar My name is Tom Chi. I spent two years of my life building the user experience team for the Google X division of Google, and it's a place I affectionately call the Department of Science Fiction because of the futuristic nature of the types of projects we took on: self-driving cars, Google Glass, and other things that you'll see soon enough. So, for those who haven't heard of this project, this is what Google Glass looks like. It allows you to overlay digital things into your eye sight while still maintaining being part of the world. So, if I, you know, were to pull out my cell phone and look into it, I'm basically out of this world now, like, I'm in my own little cell phone-tablet world, what have you. But, Google Glass has the vision of allowing us to continue to be in the world but also have access to the digital things that we need and love. Now, I am going to ask you a real simple question about Google Glass: how would you prototype this experience? How long do you think it would take you to make the first working version of the headset display? Okay, a little bit on the long side. The answer is one day. And here's what it looked like. So, basically the magic piece is the coat hanger. The coat hanger, I bent it in a specific shape and the top loop goes around your neck and then the bottom loop rests against your chest and it allows me to carry a piece of plexiglass on with a little sheet protector. So these are the things you put your book reports in so they don't get wet, I literally got at the drug store. You know, have it out at the end of the plexiglass and then it gets projected onto with the pico projector that's connected to a Netbook. And using this set-up, within one day we're already able to start having the experience of what it looks like to have digital things overlaid on your physical world, be able to move around with it, and also use the Netbook to try out tons and tons of different ideas around software. Now, after you start getting something like that working, you know, a really important problem comes up, like you're wearing this thing on your head, it's like a pair of glasses, so you don't have a mouse or a keyboard or a touchscreen, all the ways you are used to interacting with a machine. So, we thought for a second, well, maybe we could do something like, you know, what was shown in Minority Report. So, for folks who haven't seen that, basically Tom Cruise is manipulating software with his hands in front of his face and photos are flying over here and his email is over here and so on and so forth. So I'll ask the the same question again, how long do you think it would take to have the real experience of doing something like that? Two years, OK. Somebody said one day. 45 minutes. So here's how it looks. So you wear the thing that we saw that first time because you need some way to go project things, but what happens is we got two hairbands, which I think was the hardest part we had to do, ask people for their hairbands. But you put one hand in each hairband and attach that hairband, we tied a fishing line. And the fishing line goes over the top of a whiteboard and then goes down to this little assembly that's taped to the floor. And what this means is every time I move my hand in any direction, it adds tension to the line and it does the following with the assembly on the floor. So, the other end of the fishing wire is attached to a chopstick and it's not because I'm Asian, there's just a cafeteria nearby, I don't just carry chopsticks on me. But, I tied it to the end of a chopstick, I clipped it into a binder clip, and then put it over a pen, and basically what happens then is when you move your arm and it produces tension on the wire, the chopstick comes down like a lever and clicks a presentation clicker, one hand moves the presentation forward, the other hand moves the presentation backwards. So this was built in 45 minutes and that meant shortly afterwards, we were having experiences like looking at an image gallery and saying, "next image, next image, previous image," or looking at our emails and saying, "let me click into this email, let me click reply now." And this was exactly the experience of what it was like to go control software with your hands. And ultimately, what it taught us is we probably shouldn't have this in the product. We learned a lot of things about the social awkwardness of it and some of the ergonomic aspects of it that you couldn't have figured out ahead of just thinking about it. And, ergo the second prototyping rule, which is "doing is the best kind of thinking." They teach you to think a lot in school, but I think it is a little bit overrated. Now last example, you know, actually Google is not the first team that's tried to go make something like this and if you search for headset display, you get tons of images of teams that have built various systems like this, but I can tell you at a glance that none of these pieces of hardware are comfortable to wear for more than 15 minutes except for maybe the helmet over there, but then you got to wear a helmet. So, you know, how would you go figure out a way to go wear something like this comfortably? The answer is really basic materials: modeling wire, paper, clay, and using something like this is able to make something look like a pair of glasses really quickly. I cut out pieces of clay that weighed exactly the same amount as the electronic components that we were talking about putting on the device, wrapped it in paper so you didn't get clay on your face, and then taped it to the modeling wire in various places to go experiment with how a pair of glasses could fit on you. And, we discovered something really important then. Like, if you look at this drawing on the bottom, it turns out that the weight of a pair of glasses is actually mostly perceived through how much weight is on your nose. And, it also turns out that your ears can carry a lot more weight than your nose, and that is a totally different experiment, you can ask me about that. But, because of that fact, if you put weight behind your ears, it allows your ear to go act like the fulcrum of a lever and it then takes weight off of your nose on the front. And, actually, you can try this now, anybody with glasses, if you push very gently on the back of your glasses, you'll find, actually your glasses feel tremendously lighter. Now, this meant that we not only discovered something interesting about how to go, you know, that's useful for developing a device like this, we actually discovered something pretty fundamental that never been discovered about glasses, period. So, if you have really heavy glasses, you could do this and you would be more comfortable. Now, the last point I want to make is about two types of learning because through the process of rapid prototyping, you are able to learn very quickly. It's a very specific type of learning. The type of learning that you usually learn in school I call book learning. It comes from what humanity already knows and it's a necessary foundation for you guys to go and explore the world. But there is a totally different type of learning, which I call expansive learning, and this is the learning you do on behalf of humanity. Right? You are creating something new, you are expanding into the possibilities, and you're building the sphere of human knowledge in that process. And, we think about these things and as soon as you hear like, ok, the infinite realm of possibilities beyond the sphere of human knowledge, you might be thinking there's the scientists at the Large Hadron Collider who have these amazing instruments, like that's their job, right? But the truth is that this action is available to all of us, you know, it's not just for the scientists, it's also for the poet or the songwriter that expresses an emotion for the first time in a unique way. It's also for the person that has an amazing business idea that they're certain could help millions of lives. And, it's the realm of using paper, clay, and tape in order to go find a new insight in an ancient technology. So now that you know a lot about rapid prototyping, I'm excited to see what you do with it. Thank you.

And this was exactly the experience of what it was like to go control software with your hands. And ultimately, what it taught us is we probably shouldn't have this in the product. We learned a lot of things about the social awkwardness of it and some of the ergonomic aspects of it that you couldn't have figured out ahead of just thinking about it. And, ergo the second prototyping rule, which is "doing is the best kind of thinking." They teach you to think a lot in school, but I think it is a little bit overrated. Now last example, you know, actually Google is not the first team that's tried to go make something like this and if you search for headset display, you get tons of images of teams that have built various systems like this, but I can tell you at a glance that none of these pieces of hardware are comfortable to wear for more than 15 minutes except for maybe the helmet over there, but then you got to wear a helmet. So, you know, how would you go figure out a way to go wear something like this comfortably? The answer is really basic materials: modeling wire, paper, clay, and using something like this is able to make something look like a pair of glasses really quickly. I cut out pieces of clay that weighed exactly the same amount as the electronic components that we were talking about putting on the device, wrapped it in paper so you didn't get clay on your face, and then taped it to the modeling wire in various places to go experiment with how a pair of glasses could fit on you. And, we discovered something really important then. Like, if you look at this drawing on the bottom, it turns out that the weight of a pair of glasses is actually mostly perceived through how much weight is on your nose. And, it also turns out that your ears can carry a lot more weight than your nose, and that is a totally different experiment, you can ask me about that. But, because of that fact, if you put weight behind your ears, it allows your ear to go act like the fulcrum of a lever and it then takes weight off of your nose on the front. And, actually, you can try this now, anybody with glasses, if you push very gently on the back of your glasses, you'll find, actually your glasses feel tremendously lighter. Now, this meant that we not only discovered something interesting about how to go, you know, that's useful for developing a device like this, we actually discovered something pretty fundamental that never been discovered about glasses, period. So, if you have really heavy glasses, you could do this and you would be more comfortable. Now, the last point I want to make is about two types of learning because through the process of rapid prototyping, you are able to learn very quickly. It's a very specific type of learning. The type of learning that you usually learn in school I call book learning. It comes from what humanity already knows and it's a necessary foundation for you guys to go and explore the world. But there is a totally different type of learning, which I call expansive learning, and this is the learning you do on behalf of humanity. Right? You are creating something new, you are expanding into the possibilities, and you're building the sphere of human knowledge in that process. And, we think about these things and as soon as you hear like, ok, the infinite realm of possibilities beyond the sphere of human knowledge, you might be thinking there's the scientists at the Large Hadron Collider who have these amazing instruments, like that's their job, right? But the truth is that this action is available to all of us, you know, it's not just for the scientists, it's also for the poet or the songwriter that expresses an emotion for the first time in a unique way. It's also for the person that has an amazing business idea that they're certain could help millions of lives. And, it's the realm of using paper, clay, and tape in order to go find a new insight in an ancient technology. So now that you know a lot about rapid prototyping, I'm excited to see what you do with it. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar My name is Tom Chi. I spent two years of my life building the user experience team for the Google X division of Google, and it's a place I affectionately call the Department of Science Fiction because of the futuristic nature of the types of projects we took on: self-driving cars, Google Glass, and other things that you'll see soon enough. So, for those who haven't heard of this project, this is what Google Glass looks like. It allows you to overlay digital things into your eye sight while still maintaining being part of the world. So, if I, you know, were to pull out my cell phone and look into it, I'm basically out of this world now, like, I'm in my own little cell phone-tablet world, what have you. But, Google Glass has the vision of allowing us to continue to be in the world but also have access to the digital things that we need and love. Now, I am going to ask you a real simple question about Google Glass: how would you prototype this experience? How long do you think it would take you to make the first working version of the headset display? Okay, a little bit on the long side. The answer is one day. And here's what it looked like. So, basically the magic piece is the coat hanger. The coat hanger, I bent it in a specific shape and the top loop goes around your neck and then the bottom loop rests against your chest and it allows me to carry a piece of plexiglass on with a little sheet protector. So these are the things you put your book reports in so they don't get wet, I literally got at the drug store. You know, have it out at the end of the plexiglass and then it gets projected onto with the pico projector that's connected to a Netbook. And using this set-up, within one day we're already able to start having the experience of what it looks like to have digital things overlaid on your physical world, be able to move around with it, and also use the Netbook to try out tons and tons of different ideas around software. Now, after you start getting something like that working, you know, a really important problem comes up, like you're wearing this thing on your head, it's like a pair of glasses, so you don't have a mouse or a keyboard or a touchscreen, all the ways you are used to interacting with a machine. So, we thought for a second, well, maybe we could do something like, you know, what was shown in Minority Report. So, for folks who haven't seen that, basically Tom Cruise is manipulating software with his hands in front of his face and photos are flying over here and his email is over here and so on and so forth. So I'll ask the the same question again, how long do you think it would take to have the real experience of doing something like that? Two years, OK. Somebody said one day. 45 minutes. So here's how it looks. So you wear the thing that we saw that first time because you need some way to go project things, but what happens is we got two hairbands, which I think was the hardest part we had to do, ask people for their hairbands. But you put one hand in each hairband and attach that hairband, we tied a fishing line. And the fishing line goes over the top of a whiteboard and then goes down to this little assembly that's taped to the floor. And what this means is every time I move my hand in any direction, it adds tension to the line and it does the following with the assembly on the floor. So, the other end of the fishing wire is attached to a chopstick and it's not because I'm Asian, there's just a cafeteria nearby, I don't just carry chopsticks on me. But, I tied it to the end of a chopstick, I clipped it into a binder clip, and then put it over a pen, and basically what happens then is when you move your arm and it produces tension on the wire, the chopstick comes down like a lever and clicks a presentation clicker, one hand moves the presentation forward, the other hand moves the presentation backwards. So this was built in 45 minutes and that meant shortly afterwards, we were having experiences like looking at an image gallery and saying, "next image, next image, previous image," or looking at our emails and saying, "let me click into this email, let me click reply now." And this was exactly the experience of what it was like to go control software with your hands. And ultimately, what it taught us is we probably shouldn't have this in the product. We learned a lot of things about the social awkwardness of it and some of the ergonomic aspects of it that you couldn't have figured out ahead of just thinking about it. And, ergo the second prototyping rule, which is "doing is the best kind of thinking." They teach you to think a lot in school, but I think it is a little bit overrated. Now last example, you know, actually Google is not the first team that's tried to go make something like this and if you search for headset display, you get tons of images of teams that have built various systems like this, but I can tell you at a glance that none of these pieces of hardware are comfortable to wear for more than 15 minutes except for maybe the helmet over there, but then you got to wear a helmet. So, you know, how would you go figure out a way to go wear something like this comfortably? The answer is really basic materials: modeling wire, paper, clay, and using something like this is able to make something look like a pair of glasses really quickly. I cut out pieces of clay that weighed exactly the same amount as the electronic components that we were talking about putting on the device, wrapped it in paper so you didn't get clay on your face, and then taped it to the modeling wire in various places to go experiment with how a pair of glasses could fit on you. And, we discovered something really important then. Like, if you look at this drawing on the bottom, it turns out that the weight of a pair of glasses is actually mostly perceived through how much weight is on your nose. And, it also turns out that your ears can carry a lot more weight than your nose, and that is a totally different experiment, you can ask me about that. But, because of that fact, if you put weight behind your ears, it allows your ear to go act like the fulcrum of a lever and it then takes weight off of your nose on the front. And, actually, you can try this now, anybody with glasses, if you push very gently on the back of your glasses, you'll find, actually your glasses feel tremendously lighter. Now, this meant that we not only discovered something interesting about how to go, you know, that's useful for developing a device like this, we actually discovered something pretty fundamental that never been discovered about glasses, period. So, if you have really heavy glasses, you could do this and you would be more comfortable. Now, the last point I want to make is about two types of learning because through the process of rapid prototyping, you are able to learn very quickly. It's a very specific type of learning. The type of learning that you usually learn in school I call book learning. It comes from what humanity already knows and it's a necessary foundation for you guys to go and explore the world.

It's also for the person that has an amazing business idea that they're certain could help millions of lives.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 10. 

Although the question and options are not identical, the content and intent of Question 10 align with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about Tom Chi's second prototyping rule, which is "doing is the best kind of thinking." Question 10 does not directly ask about the prototyping rule but emphasizes the importance of "expansive learning," which is closely related to the idea of learning through hands-on experience and experimentation, as conveyed by the prototyping rule.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. If a more precise match is required, it might be necessary to generate additional MCQs or refine the existing ones to better align with the ground truth MCQ.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar My name is Tom Chi. I spent two years of my life building the user experience team for the Google X division of Google, and it's a place I affectionately call the Department of Science Fiction because of the futuristic nature of the types of projects we took on: self-driving cars, Google Glass, and other things that you'll see soon enough. So, for those who haven't heard of this project, this is what Google Glass looks like. It allows you to overlay digital things into your eye sight while still maintaining being part of the world. So, if I, you know, were to pull out my cell phone and look into it, I'm basically out of this world now, like, I'm in my own little cell phone-tablet world, what have you. But, Google Glass has the vision of allowing us to continue to be in the world but also have access to the digital things that we need and love. Now, I am going to ask you a real simple question about Google Glass: how would you prototype this experience? How long do you think it would take you to make the first working version of the headset display? Okay, a little bit on the long side. The answer is one day. And here's what it looked like. So, basically the magic piece is the coat hanger. The coat hanger, I bent it in a specific shape and the top loop goes around your neck and then the bottom loop rests against your chest and it allows me to carry a piece of plexiglass on with a little sheet protector. So these are the things you put your book reports in so they don't get wet, I literally got at the drug store. You know, have it out at the end of the plexiglass and then it gets projected onto with the pico projector that's connected to a Netbook. And using this set-up, within one day we're already able to start having the experience of what it looks like to have digital things overlaid on your physical world, be able to move around with it, and also use the Netbook to try out tons and tons of different ideas around software. Now, after you start getting something like that working, you know, a really important problem comes up, like you're wearing this thing on your head, it's like a pair of glasses, so you don't have a mouse or a keyboard or a touchscreen, all the ways you are used to interacting with a machine. So, we thought for a second, well, maybe we could do something like, you know, what was shown in Minority Report. So, for folks who haven't seen that, basically Tom Cruise is manipulating software with his hands in front of his face and photos are flying over here and his email is over here and so on and so forth. So I'll ask the the same question again, how long do you think it would take to have the real experience of doing something like that? Two years, OK. Somebody said one day. 45 minutes. So here's how it looks. So you wear the thing that we saw that first time because you need some way to go project things, but what happens is we got two hairbands, which I think was the hardest part we had to do, ask people for their hairbands. But you put one hand in each hairband and attach that hairband, we tied a fishing line. And the fishing line goes over the top of a whiteboard and then goes down to this little assembly that's taped to the floor. And what this means is every time I move my hand in any direction, it adds tension to the line and it does the following with the assembly on the floor. So, the other end of the fishing wire is attached to a chopstick and it's not because I'm Asian, there's just a cafeteria nearby, I don't just carry chopsticks on me. But, I tied it to the end of a chopstick, I clipped it into a binder clip, and then put it over a pen, and basically what happens then is when you move your arm and it produces tension on the wire, the chopstick comes down like a lever and clicks a presentation clicker, one hand moves the presentation forward, the other hand moves the presentation backwards. So this was built in 45 minutes and that meant shortly afterwards, we were having experiences like looking at an image gallery and saying, "next image, next image, previous image," or looking at our emails and saying, "let me click into this email, let me click reply now." And this was exactly the experience of what it was like to go control software with your hands. And ultimately, what it taught us is we probably shouldn't have this in the product. We learned a lot of things about the social awkwardness of it and some of the ergonomic aspects of it that you couldn't have figured out ahead of just thinking about it. And, ergo the second prototyping rule, which is "doing is the best kind of thinking." They teach you to think a lot in school, but I think it is a little bit overrated. Now last example, you know, actually Google is not the first team that's tried to go make something like this and if you search for headset display, you get tons of images of teams that have built various systems like this, but I can tell you at a glance that none of these pieces of hardware are comfortable to wear for more than 15 minutes except for maybe the helmet over there, but then you got to wear a helmet. So, you know, how would you go figure out a way to go wear something like this comfortably? The answer is really basic materials: modeling wire, paper, clay, and using something like this is able to make something look like a pair of glasses really quickly. I cut out pieces of clay that weighed exactly the same amount as the electronic components that we were talking about putting on the device, wrapped it in paper so you didn't get clay on your face, and then taped it to the modeling wire in various places to go experiment with how a pair of glasses could fit on you. And, we discovered something really important then. Like, if you look at this drawing on the bottom, it turns out that the weight of a pair of glasses is actually mostly perceived through how much weight is on your nose. And, it also turns out that your ears can carry a lot more weight than your nose, and that is a totally different experiment, you can ask me about that. But, because of that fact, if you put weight behind your ears, it allows your ear to go act like the fulcrum of a lever and it then takes weight off of your nose on the front. And, actually, you can try this now, anybody with glasses, if you push very gently on the back of your glasses, you'll find, actually your glasses feel tremendously lighter. Now, this meant that we not only discovered something interesting about how to go, you know, that's useful for developing a device like this, we actually discovered something pretty fundamental that never been discovered about glasses, period. So, if you have really heavy glasses, you could do this and you would be more comfortable. Now, the last point I want to make is about two types of learning because through the process of rapid prototyping, you are able to learn very quickly. It's a very specific type of learning. The type of learning that you usually learn in school I call book learning. It comes from what humanity already knows and it's a necessary foundation for you guys to go and explore the world. But there is a totally different type of learning, which I call expansive learning, and this is the learning you do on behalf of humanity. Right? You are creating something new, you are expanding into the possibilities, and you're building the sphere of human knowledge in that process. And, we think about these things and as soon as you hear like, ok, the infinite realm of possibilities beyond the sphere of human knowledge, you might be thinking there's the scientists at the Large Hadron Collider who have these amazing instruments, like that's their job, right? But the truth is that this action is available to all of us, you know, it's not just for the scientists, it's also for the poet or the songwriter that expresses an emotion for the first time in a unique way. It's also for the person that has an amazing business idea that they're certain could help millions of lives. And, it's the realm of using paper, clay, and tape in order to go find a new insight in an ancient technology. So now that you know a lot about rapid prototyping, I'm excited to see what you do with it. Thank you.

[Music] [Music] so indeed I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night but when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms work love and play and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the others is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age where is to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement but with serenity so since I tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson as for that first sphere of work I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing he had a huge ambition but it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame what it was for is to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it even as a child it seemed Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams he somehow had to escape that hardscrabble farm from which he was born no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there but he read books in every spare moment he could find it was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or Aesop's fables he was so excited he couldn't sleep he couldn't eat the great poet Emily Dickinson once said there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away how true for Lincoln though he never would travel to Europe he went with Shakespeare's Kings to marry England he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings but there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death his mother died when he was only nine years old his only sister Sara in childbirth a few years later and his first love and Rutledge at the age of 22 moreover when his mother Lay Dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an after world she simply said to him Abraham I'm going away from you now and I shall never return as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away dust to dust but only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion but followed by other cultures as well that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life you could live on in the memory of others your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence and that worthy ambition became his lodestar it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s three things had combined to lay him low he had broken his engagement with Mary Todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that his one intimate friend Joshua speed was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because speed's father had died and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room and his great friend speed went to his side and said Lincoln you must rally or you will die he said that I would just as soon die right now but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature he eventually won a seat in Congress he then ran twice for the Senate lost twice every one is broken by life Ernest Hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rivals and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet it was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought he look like a figurehead compared to these people they said why are you doing this Lincoln he said look these are the strongest and most able men in the country the country is in peril I need them by my side but perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in but it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strains and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external resume for one thing he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other people's point of view he repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility he shared credit with Eze assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008 he refused to be provoked he refused to be provoked by petty grievances he'd never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights and he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language in metaphors in stories and with the beauty of language almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul in 1863 when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed he brought his old friend Joshua speed back to the White House and remembered that conversation of decades before when he was so sad and he pointing to the proclamation said I believe in this measure my fondest hopes will be realized but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception so he put the pen down he said if ever my soul were in an act it is in this act but if I sign with a shaking hand posterity will say he hesitated so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand but even in his wildest dreams Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach I was so thrilled to find a interview with the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s and in it Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus where there were only wild barbarians who had never left this part of Russia knowing that Tolstoy was in their myths they asked him to tell stories of the great men of so I said I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great in Frederick great and Julius Caesar and they loved it but before I finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said but wait you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all we want to hear about that man who spoke with the voice of thunder who laughed like the sunrise who came from that place called America which is so far from here that if a young man should travel there he would be an old man when he arrived tell us of that man tell us of Abraham Lincoln he was stunned II told him everything he could about Lincoln and then in the interview he said what made Lincoln so great not as great a generalist Napoleon not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great but his greatness consisted and historians would roundly agree in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being so in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized that ambition that had allowed him to laborious Lee educate himself by himself to go through those string of political failures and the darkest days of the war his story would be told so as for that second sphere not of work but of love encompassing family friends and colleagues it too takes work and commitment the Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life when I helped him on his memoirs was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work power and individual success they need absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone my relationship with him began on a rather curious level I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old we had a big dance at the White House President Johnson did dance with me that night not that peculiar they're only three women out of the 16 White House fellows but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House but it was not to be that simple for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people I'd been active in the anti-vietnam war movement and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson which unfortunately came out in the New Republic two days after the dance in the White House the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power so I was certain he would kick me out of the program but instead surprising he said I'll bring her down here for a year if I can't win her over no one can so I did end up working for him in the White House eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with I like to believe it was because I was a good listener he was a great storyteller fabulous colorful anecdotal stories there was a problem with these stories however which I later discovered which is that half of them weren't true but they were great on the last so I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales but I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation so I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when I didn't have any at all everything was working perfectly until one day he said when he's discussed our relationship sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson and there was wine and cheese in a red check tablecloth all the romantic trappings and he started out Doris more than any other woman I have ever known and my heart sank and then he said you remind me of my mother it was it was pretty embarrassing given what was going on in my mind but I must say the older I've gotten the more I realized what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging line of a man a victor in a thousand contests three great civil rights laws Medicare aid to education and yet roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam and because he was so sad and so vulnerable he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power sharing his fears his sorrows and his worries and I'd like to believe that that privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then but it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life for on the surface Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside a penthouse in the city sailboats speedboats he had servants to answer any whim and he had a family who loved him deeply and yet years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family in recreation in sports or in hobbies it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family without work could not fill it as his spirit sagged his body deteriorated until I believe he slowly brought about his own death in those last years he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him he spoke with immense sadness in his voice saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children and their children in turn but it was too late despite all that power all that wealth he was alone when he finally died his ultimate terror realized so as for that third sphere of play which he never had learned to enjoy I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy enough so that a hobby a sport a love of music or art or literature or any form of recreation can provide true pleasure relaxation and replenishment so deep for instance was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theatre even during those dark days of the war he said when the lights went down in a Shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time but an even more important form of relaxation for him that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy was a love of somehow humor and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce a sidelight to the sadness he once said that he laughed so he did not cry that a good story for him was better than a drop of whiskey his storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois the lawyers and the judges would travel from one County Courthouse to the other and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories he would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales and all these stories became part of his memory bank so he could call on them whenever he needed to and they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument one of his favorite stories for example had to do with the Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen and his Lincoln told the story mr. Allen went to Britain after the war and the British people were still upset about losing the revolution so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse where he'd have to encounter it they figured he be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all and so they said we'll teach you see George Washington there oh yes he said perfectly appropriate place for him what do you mean they said well he said there's nothing to make an Englishman  faster than the sight of General George so you can imagine if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting he had hundreds of these stories you will have to relax so between his nightly treks to the theatre his storytelling and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry he found that form of play which carried him through his days in my own life I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work it all began when I was only six years old and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games so that when he went to work in New York during the day I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodger game now when you're only six years old and your father comes home every single night and listens to you as I now realize that I in excruciating detail recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon but he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story they think makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention in fact I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father because at first I'd be so excited I would blurt out the Dodgers won or the Dodgers lost which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling so I finally learned you had to stell a story from beginning to middle to end I must say so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession to sins that related to baseball the first occurred because the Dodger catcher Roy Campanella came to my hometown of Rockville Center Long Island just as it was in preparation for my First Holy Communion and I was so excited first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field but it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church when you were brought up as a Catholic you think if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church you'll be struck dead at the threshold so I went to my father in tears what are we going to do he said don't worry he's speaking at a parish hall we're sitting and folding chairs he's talking about sportsmanship it's not a sin but as I left that night I was certain that somehow I traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella and there were no indulgences around that I could buy so I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession I told the priest right away he said no problem it wasn't a religious service but then unfortunately said and what else my child and then came my seconds and I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church witching harm to others being mean to my sisters and he said to whom did you wish harm and I had to say that I wish that various New York Yankee players would break arms and legs and ankles so that the RET so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series he said how often do you make these horrible wishes and I had to say every night when I said my prayers so he said look I tell you something I love the Brooklyn Dodgers as you do but I promise you someday they will win fairly and squarely do not need to wish harm and others to make it happen oh yes I said but luckily my first confession to a baseball loving priest well though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s before I had gotten married and had my three sons I have passed his memory as well as his love of baseball onto my boys though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to LA I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston became an irrational Red Sox fan and I must say even now when I sit with my sons with our season tickets I can sometimes close my eyes against the Sun and imagine myself a young girl once more in the presence of my father watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below Jackie Robinson Roy Campanella Pee Wee Reese and Schneider I must say there is magic in these moments when I opened my eyes and I see my son's in the place where my father once sat I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told which is why in the end I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families and the public figures we have respected in our history just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe really can live on so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives thank you for letting me be that storyteller today [Applause] [Applause] really wonderful thank you what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

[Music] [Music] so indeed I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night but when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms work love and play and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the others is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age where is to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement but with serenity so since I tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson as for that first sphere of work I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing he had a huge ambition but it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame what it was for is to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it even as a child it seemed Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams he somehow had to escape that hardscrabble farm from which he was born no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there but he read books in every spare moment he could find it was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or Aesop's fables he was so excited he couldn't sleep he couldn't eat the great poet Emily Dickinson once said there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away how true for Lincoln though he never would travel to Europe he went with Shakespeare's Kings to marry England he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings but there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death his mother died when he was only nine years old his only sister Sara in childbirth a few years later and his first love and Rutledge at the age of 22 moreover when his mother Lay Dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an after world she simply said to him Abraham I'm going away from you now and I shall never return as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away dust to dust but only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion but followed by other cultures as well that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life you could live on in the memory of others your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence and that worthy ambition became his lodestar it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s three things had combined to lay him low he had broken his engagement with Mary Todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that his one intimate friend Joshua speed was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because speed's father had died and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room and his great friend speed went to his side and said Lincoln you must rally or you will die he said that I would just as soon die right now but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature he eventually won a seat in Congress he then ran twice for the Senate lost twice every one is broken by life Ernest Hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rivals and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet it was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought he look like a figurehead compared to these people they said why are you doing this Lincoln he said look these are the strongest and most able men in the country the country is in peril I need them by my side but perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in but it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strains and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external resume for one thing he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other people's point of view he repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility he shared credit with Eze assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008 he refused to be provoked he refused to be provoked by petty grievances he'd never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights and he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language in metaphors in stories and with the beauty of language almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul in 1863 when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed he brought his old friend Joshua speed back to the White House and remembered that conversation of decades before when he was so sad and he pointing to the proclamation said I believe in this measure my fondest hopes will be realized but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception so he put the pen down he said if ever my soul were in an act it is in this act but if I sign with a shaking hand posterity will say he hesitated so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand but even in his wildest dreams Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach I was so thrilled to find a interview with the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s and in it Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus where there were only wild barbarians who had never left this part of Russia knowing that Tolstoy was in their myths they asked him to tell stories of the great men of so I said I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great in Frederick great and Julius Caesar and they loved it but before I finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said but wait you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all we want to hear about that man who spoke with the voice of thunder who laughed like the sunrise who came from that place called America which is so far from here that if a young man should travel there he would be an old man when he arrived tell us of that man tell us of Abraham Lincoln he was stunned II told him everything he could about Lincoln and then in the interview he said what made Lincoln so great not as great a generalist Napoleon not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great but his greatness consisted and historians would roundly agree in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being so in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized that ambition that had allowed him to laborious Lee educate himself by himself to go through those string of political failures and the darkest days of the war his story would be told so as for that second sphere not of work but of love encompassing family friends and colleagues it too takes work and commitment the Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life when I helped him on his memoirs was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work power and individual success they need absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone my relationship with him began on a rather curious level I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old we had a big dance at the White House President Johnson did dance with me that night not that peculiar they're only three women out of the 16 White House fellows but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House but it was not to be that simple for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people I'd been active in the anti-vietnam war movement and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson which unfortunately came out in the New Republic two days after the dance in the White House the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power so I was certain he would kick me out of the program but instead surprising he said I'll bring her down here for a year if I can't win her over no one can so I did end up working for him in the White House eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with I like to believe it was because I was a good listener he was a great storyteller fabulous colorful anecdotal stories there was a problem with these stories however which I later discovered which is that half of them weren't true but they were great on the last so I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales but I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation so I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when I didn't have any at all everything was working perfectly until one day he said when he's discussed our relationship sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson and there was wine and cheese in a red check tablecloth all the romantic trappings and he started out Doris more than any other woman I have ever known and my heart sank and then he said you remind me of my mother it was it was pretty embarrassing given what was going on in my mind but I must say the older I've gotten the more I realized what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging line of a man a victor in a thousand contests three great civil rights laws Medicare aid to education and yet roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam and because he was so sad and so vulnerable he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power sharing his fears his sorrows and his worries and I'd like to believe that that privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then but it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life for on the surface Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside a penthouse in the city sailboats speedboats he had servants to answer any whim and he had a family who loved him deeply and yet years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family in recreation in sports or in hobbies it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family without work could not fill it as his spirit sagged his body deteriorated until I believe he slowly brought about his own death in those last years he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him he spoke with immense sadness in his voice saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children and their children in turn but it was too late despite all that power all that wealth he was alone when he finally died his ultimate terror realized so as for that third sphere of play which he never had learned to enjoy I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy enough so that a hobby a sport a love of music or art or literature or any form of recreation can provide true pleasure relaxation and replenishment so deep for instance was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theatre even during those dark days of the war he said when the lights went down in a Shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time but an even more important form of relaxation for him that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy was a love of somehow humor and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce a sidelight to the sadness he once said that he laughed so he did not cry that a good story for him was better than a drop of whiskey his storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois the lawyers and the judges would travel from one County Courthouse to the other and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories he would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales and all these stories became part of his memory bank so he could call on them whenever he needed to and they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument one of his favorite stories for example had to do with the Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen and his Lincoln told the story mr. Allen went to Britain after the war and the British people were still upset about losing the revolution so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse where he'd have to encounter it they figured he be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all and so they said we'll teach you see George Washington there oh yes he said perfectly appropriate place for him what do you mean they said well he said there's nothing to make an Englishman  faster than the sight of General George so you can imagine if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting he had hundreds of these stories you will have to relax so between his nightly treks to the theatre his storytelling and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry he found that form of play which carried him through his days in my own life I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work it all began when I was only six years old and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games so that when he went to work in New York during the day I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodger game now when you're only six years old and your father comes home every single night and listens to you as I now realize that I in excruciating detail recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon but he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story they think makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention in fact I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father because at first I'd be so excited I would blurt out the Dodgers won or the Dodgers lost which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling so I finally learned you had to stell a story from beginning to middle to end I must say so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession to sins that related to baseball the first occurred because the Dodger catcher Roy Campanella came to my hometown of Rockville Center Long Island just as it was in preparation for my First Holy Communion and I was so excited first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field but it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church when you were brought up as a Catholic you think if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church you'll be struck dead at the threshold so I went to my father in tears what are we going to do he said don't worry he's speaking at a parish hall we're sitting and folding chairs he's talking about sportsmanship it's not a sin but as I left that night I was certain that somehow I traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella and there were no indulgences around that I could buy so I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession I told the priest right away he said no problem it wasn't a religious service but then unfortunately said and what else my child and then came my seconds and I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church witching harm to others being mean to my sisters and he said to whom did you wish harm and I had to say that I wish that various New York Yankee players would break arms and legs and ankles so that the RET so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series he said how often do you make these horrible wishes and I had to say every night when I said my prayers so he said look I tell you something I love the Brooklyn Dodgers as you do but I promise you someday they will win fairly and squarely do not need to wish harm and others to make it happen oh yes I said but luckily my first confession to a baseball loving priest well though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s before I had gotten married and had my three sons I have passed his memory as well as his love of baseball onto my boys though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to LA I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston became an irrational Red Sox fan and I must say even now when I sit with my sons with our season tickets I can sometimes close my eyes against the Sun and imagine myself a young girl once more in the presence of my father watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below Jackie Robinson Roy Campanella Pee Wee Reese and Schneider I must say there is magic in these moments when I opened my eyes and I see my son's in the place where my father once sat I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told which is why in the end I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families and the public figures we have respected in our history just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe really can live on so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives thank you for letting me be that storyteller today [Applause] [Applause] really wonderful thank you what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

his worries and I'd like to believe that that privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then but it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life for on the surface Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside a penthouse in the city sailboats speedboats he had servants to answer any whim and he had a family who loved him deeply and yet years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family in recreation in sports or in hobbies it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family without work could not fill it as his spirit sagged his body deteriorated until I believe he slowly brought about his own death in those last years he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him he spoke with immense sadness in his voice saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children and their children in turn but it was too late despite all that power all that wealth he was alone when he finally died his ultimate terror realized so as for that third sphere of play which he never had learned to enjoy I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy enough so that a hobby a sport a love of music or art or literature or any form of recreation can provide true pleasure relaxation and replenishment so deep for instance was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theatre even during those dark days of the war he said when the lights went down in a Shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time but an even more important form of relaxation for him that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy was a love of somehow humor and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce a sidelight to the sadness he once said that he laughed so he did not cry that a good story for him was better than a drop of whiskey his storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois the lawyers and the judges would travel from one County Courthouse to the other and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories he would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales and all these stories became part of his memory bank so he could call on them whenever he needed to and they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument one of his favorite stories for example had to do with the Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen and his Lincoln told the story mr. Allen went to Britain after the war and the British people were still upset about losing the revolution so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse where he'd have to encounter it they figured he be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all and so they said we'll teach you see George Washington there oh yes he said perfectly appropriate place for him what do you mean they said well he said there's nothing to make an Englishman  faster than the sight of General George so you can imagine if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting he had hundreds of these stories you will have to relax so between his nightly treks to the theatre his storytelling and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry he found that form of play which carried him through his days in my own life I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work it all began when I was only six years old and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games so that when he went to work in New York during the day I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodger game now when you're only six years old and your father comes home every single night and listens to you as I now realize that I in excruciating detail recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon but he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story they think makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention in fact I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father because at first I'd be so excited I would blurt out the Dodgers won or the Dodgers lost which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling so I finally learned you had to stell a story from beginning to middle to end I must say so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession to sins that related to baseball the first occurred because the Dodger catcher Roy Campanella came to my hometown of Rockville Center Long Island just as it was in preparation for my First Holy Communion and I was so excited first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field but it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church when you were brought up as a Catholic you think if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church you'll be struck dead at the threshold so I went to my father in tears what are we going to do he said don't worry he's speaking at a parish hall we're sitting and folding chairs he's talking about sportsmanship it's not a sin but as I left that night I was certain that somehow I traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella and there were no indulgences around that I could buy so I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession I told the priest right away he said no problem it wasn't a religious service but then unfortunately said and what else my child and then came my seconds and I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church witching harm to others being mean to my sisters and he said to whom did you wish harm and I had to say that I wish that various New York Yankee players would break arms and legs and ankles so that the RET so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series he said how often do you make these horrible wishes and I had to say every night when I said my prayers so he said look I tell you something I love the Brooklyn Dodgers as you do but I promise you someday they will win fairly and squarely do not need to wish harm and others to make it happen oh yes I said but luckily my first confession to a baseball loving priest well though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s before I had gotten married and had my three sons I have passed his memory as well as his love of baseball onto my boys though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to LA I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston became an irrational Red Sox fan and I must say even now when I sit with my sons with our season tickets I can sometimes close my eyes against the Sun and imagine myself a young girl once more in the presence of my father watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below Jackie Robinson Roy Campanella Pee Wee Reese and Schneider I must say there is magic in these moments when I opened my eyes and I see my son's in the place where my father once sat I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told which is why in the end I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families and the public figures we have respected in our history just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe really can live on so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives thank you for letting me be that

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so indeed I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night but when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms work love and play and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the others is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age where is to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement but with serenity so since I tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson as for that first sphere of work I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing he had a huge ambition but it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame what it was for is to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it even as a child it seemed Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams he somehow had to escape that hardscrabble farm from which he was born no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there but he read books in every spare moment he could find it was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or Aesop's fables he was so excited he couldn't sleep he couldn't eat the great poet Emily Dickinson once said there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away how true for Lincoln though he never would travel to Europe he went with Shakespeare's Kings to marry England he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings but there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death his mother died when he was only nine years old his only sister Sara in childbirth a few years later and his first love and Rutledge at the age of 22 moreover when his mother Lay Dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an after world she simply said to him Abraham I'm going away from you now and I shall never return as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away dust to dust but only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion but followed by other cultures as well that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life you could live on in the memory of others your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence and that worthy ambition became his lodestar it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s three things had combined to lay him low he had broken his engagement with Mary Todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that his one intimate friend Joshua speed was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because speed's father had died and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room and his great friend speed went to his side and said Lincoln you must rally or you will die he said that I would just as soon die right now but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature he eventually won a seat in Congress he then ran twice for the Senate lost twice every one is broken by life Ernest Hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rivals and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet it was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought he look like a figurehead compared to these people they said why are you doing this Lincoln he said look these are the strongest and most able men in the country the country is in peril I need them by my side but perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in but it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strains and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external resume for one thing he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other people's point of view he repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility he shared credit with Eze assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008 he refused to be provoked he refused to be provoked by petty grievances he'd never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights and he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language in metaphors in stories and with the beauty of language almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul in 1863 when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed he brought his old friend Joshua speed back to the White House and remembered that conversation of decades before when he was so sad and he pointing to the proclamation said I believe in this measure my fondest hopes will be realized but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception so he put the pen down he said if ever my soul were in an act it is in this act but if I sign with a shaking hand posterity will say he hesitated so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand but even in his wildest dreams Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach I was so thrilled to find a interview with the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s and in it Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus where there were only wild barbarians who had never left this part of Russia knowing that Tolstoy was in their myths they asked him to tell stories of the great men of so I said I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great in Frederick great and Julius Caesar and they loved it but before I finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said but wait you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all we want to hear about that man who spoke with the voice of thunder who laughed like the sunrise who came from that place called America which is so far from here that if a young man should travel there he would be an old man when he arrived tell us of that man tell us of Abraham Lincoln he was stunned II told him everything he could about Lincoln and then in the interview he said what made Lincoln so great not as great a generalist Napoleon not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great but his greatness consisted and historians would roundly agree in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being so in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized that ambition that had allowed him to laborious Lee educate himself by himself to go through those string of political failures and the darkest days of the war his story would be told so as for that second sphere not of work but of love encompassing family friends and colleagues it too takes work and commitment the Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life when I helped him on his memoirs was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work power and individual success they need absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone my relationship with him began on a rather curious level I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old we had a big dance at the White House President Johnson did dance with me that night not that peculiar they're only three women out of the 16 White House fellows but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House but it was not to be that simple for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people I'd been active in the anti-vietnam war movement and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson which unfortunately came out in the New Republic two days after the dance in the White House the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power so I was certain he would kick me out of the program but instead surprising he said I'll bring her down here for a year if I can't win her over no one can so I did end up working for him in the White House eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with I like to believe it was because I was a good listener he was a great storyteller fabulous colorful anecdotal stories there was a problem with these stories however which I later discovered which is that half of them weren't true but they were great on the last so I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales but I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation so I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when I didn't have any at all everything was working perfectly until one day he said when he's discussed our relationship sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson and there was wine and cheese in a red check tablecloth all the romantic trappings and he started out Doris more than any other woman I have ever known and my heart sank and then he said you remind me of my mother it was it was pretty embarrassing given what was going on in my mind but I must say the older I've gotten the more I realized what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging line of a man a victor in a thousand contests three great civil rights laws Medicare aid to education and yet roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam and because he was so sad and so vulnerable he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power sharing his fears his sorrows and his worries and I'd like to believe that that privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then but it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life for on the surface Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted he owned a spacious

people look toward a new president and forgetting him he spoke with immense sadness in his voice saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children and their children in turn but it was too

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so indeed I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night but when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms work love and play and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the others is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age where is to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement but with serenity so since I tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson as for that first sphere of work I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing he had a huge ambition but it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame what it was for is to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it even as a child it seemed Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams he somehow had to escape that hardscrabble farm from which he was born no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there but he read books in every spare moment he could find it was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or Aesop's fables he was so excited he couldn't sleep he couldn't eat the great poet Emily Dickinson once said there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away how true for Lincoln though he never would travel to Europe he went with Shakespeare's Kings to marry England he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings but there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death his mother died when he was only nine years old his only sister Sara in childbirth a few years later and his first love and Rutledge at the age of 22 moreover when his mother Lay Dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an after world she simply said to him Abraham I'm going away from you now and I shall never return as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away dust to dust but only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion but followed by other cultures as well that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life you could live on in the memory of others your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence and that worthy ambition became his lodestar it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s three things had combined to lay him low he had broken his engagement with Mary Todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that his one intimate friend Joshua speed was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because speed's father had died and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room and his great friend speed went to his side and said Lincoln you must rally or you will die he said that I would just as soon die right now but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature he eventually won a seat in Congress he then ran twice for the Senate lost twice every one is broken by life Ernest Hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rivals and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet it was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought he look like a figurehead compared to these people they said why are you doing this Lincoln he said look these are the strongest and most able men in the country the country is in peril I need them by my side but perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in but it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strains and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external resume for one thing he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other people's point of view he repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility he shared credit with Eze assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008 he refused to be provoked he refused to be provoked by petty grievances he'd never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights and he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language in metaphors in stories and with the beauty of language almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul in 1863 when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed he brought his old friend Joshua speed back to the White House and remembered that conversation of decades before when he was so sad and he pointing to the proclamation said I believe in this measure my fondest hopes will be realized but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception so he put the pen down he said if ever my soul were in an act it is in this act but if I sign with a shaking hand posterity will say he hesitated so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand but even in his wildest dreams Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach I was so thrilled to find a interview with the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s and in it Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus where there were only wild barbarians who had never left this part of Russia knowing that Tolstoy was in their myths they asked him to tell stories of the great men of so I said I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great in Frederick great and Julius Caesar and they loved it but before I finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said but wait you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all we want to hear about that man who spoke with the voice of thunder who laughed like the sunrise who came from that place called America which is so far from here that if a young man should travel there he would be an old man when he arrived tell us of that man tell us of Abraham Lincoln he was stunned II told him everything he could about Lincoln and then in the interview he said what made Lincoln so great not as great a generalist Napoleon not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great but his greatness consisted and historians would roundly agree in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being so in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized that ambition that had allowed him to laborious Lee educate himself by himself to go through those string of political failures and the darkest days of the war his story would be told so as for that second sphere not of work but of love encompassing family friends and colleagues it too takes work and commitment the Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life when I helped him on his memoirs was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work power and individual success they need absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone my relationship with him began on a rather curious level I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old we had a big dance at the White House President Johnson did dance with me that night not that peculiar they're only three women out of the 16 White House fellows but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House but it was not to be that simple for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people I'd been active in the anti-vietnam war movement and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson which unfortunately came out in the New Republic two days after the dance in the White House the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power so I was certain he would kick me out of the program but instead surprising he said I'll bring her down here for a year if I can't win her over no one can so I did end up working for him in the White House eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with I like to believe it was because I was a good listener he was a great storyteller fabulous colorful anecdotal stories there was a problem with these stories however which I later discovered which is that half of them weren't true but they were great on the last so I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales but I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation so I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when I didn't have any at all everything was working perfectly until one day he said when he's discussed our relationship sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson and there was wine and cheese in a red check tablecloth all the romantic trappings and he started out Doris more than any other woman I have ever known and my heart sank and then he said you remind me of my mother it was it was pretty embarrassing given what was going on in my mind but I must say the older I've gotten the more I realized what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging line of a man a victor in a thousand contests three great civil rights laws Medicare aid to education and yet roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam and because he was so sad and so vulnerable he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power sharing his fears his sorrows and his worries and I'd like to believe that that privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then but it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life for on the surface Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside a penthouse in the city sailboats speedboats he had servants to answer any whim and he had a family who loved him deeply and yet years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family in recreation in sports or in hobbies it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family without work could not fill it as his spirit sagged his body deteriorated until I believe he slowly brought about his own death in those last years he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him he spoke with immense sadness in his voice saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children and their children in turn but it was too late despite all that power all that wealth he was alone when he finally died his ultimate terror realized so as for that third sphere of play which he never had learned to enjoy I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy enough so that a hobby a sport a love of music or art or literature or any form of recreation can provide true pleasure relaxation and replenishment so deep for instance was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theatre even during those dark days of the war he said when the lights went down in a Shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time but an even more important form of relaxation for him that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy was a love of somehow humor and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce a sidelight to the sadness he once said that he laughed so he did not cry that a good story for him was better than a drop of whiskey his storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois the lawyers and the judges would travel from one County Courthouse to the other and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories he would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales and all these stories became part of his memory bank so he could call on them whenever he needed to and they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument one of his favorite stories for example had to do with the Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen and his Lincoln told the story mr. Allen went to Britain after the war and the British people were still upset about losing the revolution so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse where he'd have to encounter it they figured he be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all and so they said we'll teach you see George Washington there oh yes he said perfectly appropriate place for him what do you mean they said well he said there's nothing to make an Englishman  faster than the sight of General George so you can imagine if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting he had hundreds of these stories you will have to relax so between his nightly treks to the theatre his storytelling and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry he found that form of play which carried him through his days in my own life I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work it all began when I was only six years old and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games so that when he went to work in New York during the day I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodger game now when you're only six years old and your father comes home every single night and listens to you as I now realize that I in excruciating detail recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon but he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story they think makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention in fact I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father because at first I'd be so excited I would blurt out the Dodgers won or the Dodgers lost which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling so I finally learned you had to stell a story from beginning to middle to end I must say so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession to sins that related to baseball the first occurred because the Dodger catcher Roy Campanella came to my hometown of Rockville Center Long Island just as it was in preparation for my First Holy Communion and I was so excited first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field but it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church when you were brought up as a Catholic you think if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church you'll be struck dead at the threshold so I went to my father in tears what are we going to do he said don't worry he's speaking at a parish hall we're sitting and folding chairs he's talking about sportsmanship it's not a sin but as I left that night I was certain that somehow I traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella and there were no indulgences around that I could buy so I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession I told the priest right away he said no problem it wasn't a religious service but then unfortunately said and what else my child and then came my seconds and I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church witching harm to others being mean to my sisters and he said to whom did you wish harm and I had to say that I wish that various New York Yankee players would break arms and legs and ankles so that the RET so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series he said how often do you make these horrible wishes and I had to say every night when I said my prayers so he said look I tell you something I love the Brooklyn Dodgers as you do but I promise you someday they will win fairly and squarely do not need to wish harm and others to make it happen oh yes I said but luckily my first confession to a baseball loving priest well though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s before I had gotten married and had my three sons I have passed his memory as well as his love of baseball onto my boys though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to LA I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston became an irrational Red Sox fan and I must say even now when I sit with my sons with our season tickets I can sometimes close my eyes against the Sun and imagine myself a young girl once more in the presence of my father watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below Jackie Robinson Roy Campanella Pee Wee Reese and Schneider I must say there is magic in these moments when I opened my eyes and I see my son's in the place where my father once sat I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told which is why in the end I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families and the public figures we have respected in our history just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe really can live on so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives thank you for letting me be that storyteller today [Applause] [Applause] really wonderful thank you what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

who are we that is the big question and essentially we are just an upright walking big brain super intelligent ape this could be us we belong to the family called the humanity we are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens and it's important to remember that and in terms of our place in the world today and our future and planet Earth we are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today and that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times we're one species out of approximately one let's say at least sixteen upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years but as far as we know we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today except for the bonobos and it's important to remember that because the bonobos are so human and they share 99% of their genes with us and we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes it's important to remember that we evolved now I know that's a dirty word for some people but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas the chimpanzee and also the bonobos we have a common past and we have a common future and it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as an interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today and it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past and this is how we look for them a group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly off across vast areas of Africa looking for small fragments of bone fossil bone that may be on the surface and that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in northern Kenya looking for fossils I thought many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture but if you look very carefully there is a jaw no a jaw of a 4.1 million year old upright walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side it's extremely time consuming labor-intensive and it is something that it's going to involve a lot more people to begin to piece together our paths we still really haven't got a very complete picture of it when we find a fossil we market today we've got great technology we have GPS we mark it with a GPS fix and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen so we could essentially put it back on the surface exactly where we found it and we can bring all this information into big GIS packages today when we then find something very important like the bones of a human ancestor we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly using dental picks and fine paintbrushes and all the sediment is then put through these screens and where we go again through it very carefully looking for small bone fragments and it's been washed and these things are so exciting they are so often the only or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains and here is a very special moment when my mother and myself were digging up and some remains of human human ancestors and it isn't one of the most special things to ever do with your mother cannot many people look and say that but now let me take you back to Africa two million years ago I just like to point out if you look at the map of Africa it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden or runs down to Lake Malawi and the Rift Valley is a depression it's a basin and rivers flowed down from the highlands into the basin carrying sediment preserving the bones of animals that live there if you want to become a fossil you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you okay so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors because it's incredibly difficult eh for these things to become to be preserved and secondly for them to have been brought back up to the surface and we really have only spent fifty years looking for these remains and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story so that's good too Lake Turkana which is one such Lake basin in the very north of our country Kenya and if you look north here there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that live there fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin which represents some twenty thousand square miles that's a huge job that we've got on our hands two million years ago at Lake Turkana Homo erectus one of our human ancestors actually lived in this region you can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north but essentially two million years ago Homo erectus up in the far right corner lived alongside three other species of human ancestor and here is a skull of a homo erectus which have just pulled off the shelf there but it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm in fact if you go back in time it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids of human ancestors that coexist at any one time where did these things come from that's what we're still trying to find answers to and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species and our ancestors are no exception there's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana but I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains and we were able to dig up when we got old enough fossils such as this a slender snouted crocodile and we dug up giant tortoises and elephants and things like that but when I was 12 as I was in this picture a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well because I was the same age that he was when he died and I imagined him to be tall dark skinned his brother certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey probably sweating heavily as they did so he was very able to use stones effectively as tools and this individual himself this one that I'm holding up here actually had a bad back he probably had an injury as a child he the scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female and probably much smaller members of his family group to have got to where he did in life age 12 unfortunately for him he fell into a swamp and was and couldn't get out essentially his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved and he remained there until 1.6 million years later when this very famous fossil hunter Camille Camille walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles recognized it as as being hominid it it's actually this little piece up here on the top well an excavation was begun immediately and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment and what was so fun about it was the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree and fairly recently the tree had grown up but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope we began to find limb bones we found finger bones the bones of the pelvis vertebrae ribs collarbones things that had never ever been seen before and in Homo erectus it was truly exciting he had a body very similar to our own and he was on the threshold of becoming human well it's shortly afterwards members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia and China and also in parts of Indonesia so Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe some exciting finds again as I mentioned from Dmanisi in the Republic of Georgia but also surprising finds from recently announced from the island of Flores in Indonesia where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated and have become dwarfed and they're only about a metre in height but they lived only 18,000 years ago and that is truly extraordinary to think about just to put this in terms of generations because people do find it hard to think of time Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago we evolved essentially from an African stock again at about 200,000 years as a fully fledged us and we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago and until 30,000 years ago at least three upright-walking its shared the planet earth the question now is for who who are we were certainly a polluting wasteful aggressive species with a few nice things thrown in perhaps for the most part but you're not particularly pleasant at all we have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors is this a good evolutionary adaptation or is it going to lead us to being the shortest lived hominid species on planet earth and what is it that really makes us us I think it's our collective intelligence it's our ability to write things down our language and our consciousness from very primitive beginnings with a very crude toolkit of stones we now have a very advanced toolkit and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels we've got buggies to Mars we've mapped the human genome and recently even created synthetic life thanks to craig Venter and we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world from extraordinary places even from within an excavation in northern Kenya we can talk to people about what we're doing as albor so clearly has reminded us we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth if you look at the the fossil record for about on average a million years at a time we've only been around for the past 200 thousand years as a species yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people and last year our population grew by 80 million I mean these are extraordinary numbers you can see here again taken from Al Gore's book but what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth we have to control our numbers and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today but we have to control our numbers because we can't really hold it together as a species my father so appropriately put it that we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species can we hold it together it's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa we all have an African origin we have a common past and we share a common future evolutionary speaking we're just a blip we're sitting on the edge of a precipice we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today we could tell every single human being out there if we really wanted to but will we do that or will we just let nature take its course well to end on a very positive note I think evolutionary speaking this is probably a fairly good thing in the end I'll leave it at that thank you very much you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the only upright walking ape that exists on Earth, other than humans. The correct answer is Bonobos.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 asks about the species to which humans belong, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ.

However, I noticed that the transcript mentions Bonobos as the closest relatives of humans, sharing 99% of their genes. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about Bonobos or their relationship to humans.

Given the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would suggest Question 1, but with a clear understanding that it does not match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: 1 (with a note that it does not closely match the ground truth MCQ)

To create a matching MCQ, I would suggest generating a new question that asks about the closest relatives of humans or the only upright walking ape that exists on Earth, other than humans. For example:

Question: What is the only upright walking ape that exists on Earth, other than humans?
Options: A. Gorillas, B. Chimpanzees, C. Bonobos, D. Orangutans

**Transcript**:
who are we that is the big question and essentially we are just an upright walking big brain super intelligent ape this could be us we belong to the family called the humanity we are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens and it's important to remember that and in terms of our place in the world today and our future and planet Earth we are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today and that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times we're one species out of approximately one let's say at least sixteen upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years but as far as we know we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today except for the bonobos and it's important to remember that because the bonobos are so human and they share 99% of their genes with us and we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes it's important to remember that we evolved now I know that's a dirty word for some people but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas the chimpanzee and also the bonobos we have a common past and we have a common future and it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as an interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today and it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past and this is how we look for them a group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly off across vast areas of Africa looking for small fragments of bone fossil bone that may be on the surface and that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in northern Kenya looking for fossils I thought many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture but if you look very carefully there is a jaw no a jaw of a 4.1 million year old upright walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side it's extremely time consuming labor-intensive and it is something that it's going to involve a lot more people to begin to piece together our paths we still really haven't got a very complete picture of it when we find a fossil we market today we've got great technology we have GPS we mark it with a GPS fix and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen so we could essentially put it back on the surface exactly where we found it and we can bring all this information into big GIS packages today when we then find something very important like the bones of a human ancestor we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly using dental picks and fine paintbrushes and all the sediment is then put through these screens and where we go again through it very carefully looking for small bone fragments and it's been washed and these things are so exciting they are so often the only or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains and here is a very special moment when my mother and myself were digging up and some remains of human human ancestors and it isn't one of the most special things to ever do with your mother cannot many people look and say that but now let me take you back to Africa two million years ago I just like to point out if you look at the map of Africa it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden or runs down to Lake Malawi and the Rift Valley is a depression it's a basin and rivers flowed down from the highlands into the basin carrying sediment preserving the bones of animals that live there if you want to become a fossil you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you okay so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors because it's incredibly difficult eh for these things to become to be preserved and secondly for them to have been brought back up to the surface and we really have only spent fifty years looking for these remains and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story so that's good too Lake Turkana which is one such Lake basin in the very north of our country Kenya and if you look north here there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that live there fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin which represents some twenty thousand square miles that's a huge job that we've got on our hands two million years ago at Lake Turkana Homo erectus one of our human ancestors actually lived in this region you can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north but essentially two million years ago Homo erectus up in the far right corner lived alongside three other species of human ancestor and here is a skull of a homo erectus which have just pulled off the shelf there but it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm in fact if you go back in time it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids of human ancestors that coexist at any one time where did these things come from that's what we're still trying to find answers to and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species and our ancestors are no exception there's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana but I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains and we were able to dig up when we got old enough fossils such as this a slender snouted crocodile and we dug up giant tortoises and elephants and things like that but when I was 12 as I was in this picture a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well because I was the same age that he was when he died and I imagined him to be tall dark skinned his brother certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey probably sweating heavily as they did so he was very able to use stones effectively as tools and this individual himself this one that I'm holding up here actually had a bad back he probably had an injury as a child he the scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female and probably much smaller members of his family group to have got to where he did in life age 12 unfortunately for him he fell into a swamp and was and couldn't get out essentially his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved and he remained there until 1.6 million years later when this very famous fossil hunter Camille Camille walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles recognized it as as being hominid it it's actually this little piece up here on the top well an excavation was begun immediately and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment and what was so fun about it was the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree and fairly recently the tree had grown up but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope we began to find limb bones we found finger bones the bones of the pelvis vertebrae ribs collarbones things that had never ever been seen before and in Homo erectus it was truly exciting he had a body very similar to our own and he was on the threshold of becoming human well it's shortly afterwards members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia and China and also in parts of Indonesia so Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe some exciting finds again as I mentioned from Dmanisi in the Republic of Georgia but also surprising finds from recently announced from the island of Flores in Indonesia where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated and have become dwarfed and they're only about a metre in height but they lived only 18,000 years ago and that is truly extraordinary to think about just to put this in terms of generations because people do find it hard to think of time Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago we evolved essentially from an African stock again at about 200,000 years as a fully fledged us and we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago and until 30,000 years ago at least three upright-walking its shared the planet earth the question now is for who who are we were certainly a polluting wasteful aggressive species with a few nice things thrown in perhaps for the most part but you're not particularly pleasant at all we have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors is this a good evolutionary adaptation or is it going to lead us to being the shortest lived hominid species on planet earth and what is it that really makes us us I think it's our collective intelligence it's our ability to write things down our language and our consciousness from very primitive beginnings with a very crude toolkit of stones we now have a very advanced toolkit and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels we've got buggies to Mars we've mapped the human genome and recently even created synthetic life thanks to craig Venter and we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world from extraordinary places even from within an excavation in northern Kenya we can talk to people about what we're doing as albor so clearly has reminded us we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth if you look at the the fossil record for about on average a million years at a

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of fossil found on the shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya, which is a 4.1 million year old jaw of an upright walking ape.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 9, which asks about the approximate time frame for the existence of human ancestors on Earth. Although it does not specifically mention the fossil found on the shore of Lake Turkana, it does mention the time frame of 6-8 million years, which is related to the evolution of human ancestors.

However, I must note that the similarity between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs is low, and none of the generated MCQs accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar, but with a low similarity score.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the conditions necessary for a fossil to form, according to Leakey. The most similar generated MCQ is not available, but Question 3 has some relation to fossil discovery.

However, I must note that Question 3 does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. But if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 3 is the closest, but still not a good match.

Index: 3 (with a note that it's not a good match)

**Transcript**:
who are we that is the big question and essentially we are just an upright walking big brain super intelligent ape this could be us we belong to the family called the humanity we are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens and it's important to remember that and in terms of our place in the world today and our future and planet Earth we are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today and that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times we're one species out of approximately one let's say at least sixteen upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years but as far as we know we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today except for the bonobos and it's important to remember that because the bonobos are so human and they share 99% of their genes with us and we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes it's important to remember that we evolved now I know that's a dirty word for some people but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas the chimpanzee and also the bonobos we have a common past and we have a common future and it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as an interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today and it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past and this is how we look for them a group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly off across vast areas of Africa looking for small fragments of bone fossil bone that may be on the surface and that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in northern Kenya looking for fossils I thought many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture but if you look very carefully there is a jaw no a jaw of a 4.1 million year old upright walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side it's extremely time consuming labor-intensive and it is something that it's going to involve a lot more people to begin to piece together our paths we still really haven't got a very complete picture of it when we find a fossil we market today we've got great technology we have GPS we mark it with a GPS fix and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen so we could essentially put it back on the surface exactly where we found it and we can bring all this information into big GIS packages today when we then find something very important like the bones of a human ancestor we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly using dental picks and fine paintbrushes and all the sediment is then put through these screens and where we go again through it very carefully looking for small bone fragments and it's been washed and these things are so exciting they are so often the only or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains and here is a very special moment when my mother and myself were digging up and some remains of human human ancestors and it isn't one of the most special things to ever do with your mother cannot many people look and say that but now let me take you back to Africa two million years ago I just like to point out if you look at the map of Africa it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden or runs down to Lake Malawi and the Rift Valley is a depression it's a basin and rivers flowed down from the highlands into the basin carrying sediment preserving the bones of animals that live there if you want to become a fossil you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you okay so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors because it's incredibly difficult eh for these things to become to be preserved and secondly for them to have been brought back up to the surface and we really have only spent fifty years looking for these remains and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story so that's good too Lake Turkana which is one such Lake basin in the very north of our country Kenya and if you look north here there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that live there fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin which represents some twenty thousand square miles that's a huge job that we've got on our hands two million years ago at Lake Turkana Homo erectus one of our human ancestors actually lived in this region you can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north but essentially two million years ago Homo erectus up in the far right corner lived alongside three other species of human ancestor and here is a skull of a homo erectus which have just pulled off the shelf there but it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm in fact if you go back in time it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids of human ancestors that coexist at any one time where did these things come from that's what we're still trying to find answers to and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species and our ancestors are no exception there's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana but I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains and we were able to dig up when we got old enough fossils such as this a slender snouted crocodile and we dug up giant tortoises and elephants and things like that but when I was 12 as I was in this picture a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well because I was the same age that he was when he died and I imagined him to be tall dark skinned his brother certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey probably sweating heavily as they did so he was very able to use stones effectively as tools and this individual himself this one that I'm holding up here actually had a bad back he probably had an injury as a child he the scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female and probably much smaller members of his family group to have got to where he did in life age 12 unfortunately for him he fell into a swamp and was and couldn't get out essentially his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved and he remained there until 1.6 million years later when this very famous fossil hunter Camille Camille walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles recognized it as as being hominid it it's actually this little piece up here on the top well an excavation was begun immediately and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment and what was so fun about it was the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree and fairly recently the tree had grown up but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope we began to find limb bones we found finger bones the bones of the pelvis vertebrae ribs collarbones things that had never ever been seen before and in Homo erectus it was truly exciting he had a body very similar to our own and he was on the threshold of becoming human well it's shortly afterwards members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia and China and also in parts of Indonesia so Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe some exciting finds again as I mentioned from Dmanisi in the Republic of Georgia but also surprising finds from recently announced from the island of Flores in Indonesia where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated and have become dwarfed and they're only about a metre in height but they lived only 18,000 years ago and that is truly extraordinary to think about just to put this in terms of generations because people do find it hard to think of time Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago we evolved essentially from an African stock again at about 200,000 years as a fully fledged us and we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago and until 30,000 years ago at least three upright-walking its shared the planet earth the question now is for who who are we were certainly a polluting wasteful aggressive species with a few nice things thrown in perhaps for the most part but you're not particularly pleasant at all we have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors is this a good evolutionary adaptation or is it going to lead us to being the shortest lived hominid species on planet earth and what is it that really makes us us I think it's our collective intelligence it's our ability to write things down our language and our consciousness from very primitive beginnings with a very crude toolkit of stones we now have a very advanced toolkit and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels we've got buggies to Mars we've mapped the human genome and recently even created synthetic life thanks to craig Venter and we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world from extraordinary places even from within an excavation in northern Kenya we can talk to people about what we're doing as albor so clearly has reminded us we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth if you look at the the fossil record for about on average a million years at a time we've only been around for the past 200 thousand years as a species yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people and last year our population grew by 80 million I mean these are extraordinary numbers you can see here again taken from Al Gore's book but what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth we have to control our numbers and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today but we have to control our numbers because we can't really hold it together as a species my father so appropriately put it that we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species can we hold it together it's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa we all have an African origin we have a common past and we share a common future evolutionary speaking we're just a blip we're sitting on the edge of a precipice we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today we could tell every single human being out there if we really wanted to but will we do that or will we just let nature take its course well to end on a very positive note I think evolutionary speaking this is probably a fairly good thing in the end I'll leave it at that thank you very much you

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of the overall context.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the duration of the fire that destroyed Hoffman's house. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs address this specific question.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the context of the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 4: "What inspired the speaker's new project, 'A Life of Bits and Pieces'?" This question is related to the context of the fire and its aftermath, but it does not directly address the duration of the fire.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

Index: 4

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the question asked in the ground truth MCQ.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You look down and see a yellow pencil lying on your desk. Your eyes, and then your brain, are collecting all sorts of information about the pencil: its size, color, shape, distance, and more. But, how exactly does this happen? The ancient Greeks were the first to think more or less scientifically about what light is and how vision works. Some Greek philosophers, including Plato and Pythagoras, thought that light originated in our eyes and that vision happened when little, invisible probes were sent to gather information about far-away objects. It took over a thousand years before the Arab scientist, Alhazen, figured out that the old, Greek theory of light couldn't be right. In Alhazen's picture, your eyes don't send out invisible, intelligence-gathering probes, they simply collect the light that falls into them. Alhazen's theory accounts for a fact that the Greek's couldn't easily explain: why it gets dark sometimes. The idea is that very few objects actually emit their own light. The special, light-emitting objects, like the sun or a lightbulb, are known as sources of light. Most of the things we see, like that pencil on your desk, are simply reflecting light from a source rather than producing their own. So, when you look at your pencil, the light that hits your eye actually originated at the sun and has traveled millions of miles across empty space before bouncing off the pencil and into your eye, which is pretty cool when you think about it. But, what exactly is the stuff that is emitted from the sun and how do we see it? Is it a particle, like atoms, or is it a wave, like ripples on the surface of a pond? Scientists in the modern era would spend a couple of hundred years figuring out the answer to this question. Isaac Newton was one of the earliest. Newton believed that light is made up of tiny, atom-like particles, which he called corpuscles. Using this assumption, he was able to explain some properties of light. For example, refraction, which is how a beam of light appears to bend as it passes from air into water. But, in science, even geniuses sometimes get things wrong. In the 19th century, long after Newton died, scientists did a series of experiments that clearly showed that light can't be made up of tiny, atom-like particles. For one thing, two beams of light that cross paths don't interact with each other at all. If light were made of tiny, solid balls, then you would expect that some of the particles from Beam A would crash into some of the particles from Beam B. If that happened, the two particles involved in the collision would bounce off in random directions. But, that doesn't happen. The beams of light pass right through each other as you can check for yourself with two laser pointers and some chalk dust. For another thing, light makes interference patterns. Interference patterns are the complicated undulations that happen when two wave patterns occupy the same space. They can be seen when two objects disturb the surface of a still pond, and also when two point-like sources of light are placed near each other. Only waves make interference patterns, particles don't. And, as a bonus, understanding that light acts like a wave leads naturally to an explanation of what color is and why that pencil looks yellow. So, it's settled then, light is a wave, right? Not so fast! In the 20th century, scientists did experiments that appear to show light acting like a particle. For instance, when you shine light on a metal, the light transfers its energy to the atoms in the metal in discrete packets called quanta. But, we can't just forget about properties like interference, either. So these quanta of light aren't at all like the tiny, hard spheres Newton imagined. This result, that light sometimes behaves like a particle and sometimes behaves like a wave, led to a revolutionary new physics theory called quantum mechanics. So, after all that, let's go back to the question, "What is light?" Well, light isn't really like anything we're used to dealing with in our everyday lives. Sometimes it behaves like a particle and other times it behaves like a wave, but it isn't exactly like either.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You look down and see a yellow pencil lying on your desk. Your eyes, and then your brain, are collecting all sorts of information about the pencil: its size, color, shape, distance, and more. But, how exactly does this happen? The ancient Greeks were the first to think more or less scientifically about what light is and how vision works. Some Greek philosophers, including Plato and Pythagoras, thought that light originated in our eyes and that vision happened when little, invisible probes were sent to gather information about far-away objects. It took over a thousand years before the Arab scientist, Alhazen, figured out that the old, Greek theory of light couldn't be right. In Alhazen's picture, your eyes don't send out invisible, intelligence-gathering probes, they simply collect the light that falls into them. Alhazen's theory accounts for a fact that the Greek's couldn't easily explain: why it gets dark sometimes. The idea is that very few objects actually emit their own light. The special, light-emitting objects, like the sun or a lightbulb, are known as sources of light. Most of the things we see, like that pencil on your desk, are simply reflecting light from a source rather than producing their own. So, when you look at your pencil, the light that hits your eye actually originated at the sun and has traveled millions of miles across empty space before bouncing off the pencil and into your eye, which is pretty cool when you think about it. But, what exactly is the stuff that is emitted from the sun and how do we see it? Is it a particle, like atoms, or is it a wave, like ripples on the surface of a pond? Scientists in the modern era would spend a couple of hundred years figuring out the answer to this question. Isaac Newton was one of the earliest. Newton believed that light is made up of tiny, atom-like particles, which he called corpuscles. Using this assumption, he was able to explain some properties of light. For example, refraction, which is how a beam of light appears to bend as it passes from air into water. But, in science, even geniuses sometimes get things wrong. In the 19th century, long after Newton died, scientists did a series of experiments that clearly showed that light can't be made up of tiny, atom-like particles. For one thing, two beams of light that cross paths don't interact with each other at all. If light were made of tiny, solid balls, then you would expect that some of the particles from Beam A would crash into some of the particles from Beam B. If that happened, the two particles involved in the collision would bounce off in random directions. But, that doesn't happen. The beams of light pass right through each other as you can check for yourself with two laser pointers and some chalk dust. For another thing, light makes interference patterns. Interference patterns are the complicated undulations that happen when two wave patterns occupy the same space. They can be seen when two objects disturb the surface of a still pond, and also when two point-like sources of light are placed near each other. Only waves make interference patterns, particles don't. And, as a bonus, understanding that light acts like a wave leads naturally to an explanation of what color is and why that pencil looks yellow. So, it's settled then, light is a wave, right? Not so fast! In the 20th century, scientists did experiments that appear to show light acting like a particle. For instance, when you shine light on a metal, the light transfers its energy to the atoms in the metal in discrete packets called quanta. But, we can't just forget about properties like interference, either. So these quanta of light aren't at all like the tiny, hard spheres Newton imagined. This result, that light sometimes behaves like a particle and sometimes behaves like a wave, led to a revolutionary new physics theory called quantum mechanics. So, after all that, let's go back to the question, "What is light?" Well, light isn't really like anything we're used to dealing with in our everyday lives. Sometimes it behaves like a particle and other times it behaves like a wave, but it isn't exactly like either.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 8 does not directly ask about "interference patterns," I will continue to look for a better match.

A more suitable match is not available, but if I had to choose another question that somewhat relates to the concept of interference patterns, I would consider Question 3, which mentions the wave-like properties of light, and Question 9, which talks about combining the understanding of light as a wave and a particle.

But again, none of these questions directly ask about "interference patterns." Therefore, I must conclude that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that the closest match is not available, but if I had to choose, I would say:

 Question 8

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You know what the greatest secret of history is? It's that history can be changed. And, yeah, yeah, I know, everyone says history can't be changed, but it can. And today we're going to talk about how history isn't just something that goes backwards, history goes forward too. And all those great things that haven't happened yet, that's history that's just waiting to be written. So how do you change history? I'm going to tell you by sharing with you the three things that I tell my kids every night when I tuck them into bed. It's true. I stole the idea from a friend of mine who told me what his father used to share with him. Every single night, when I tuck my kids into bed, I tell them these three things: dream big, work hard, and stay humble. So let's look at them all. First, dream big. You know who has the biggest, best dreams of all? You, young people. You know how old Martin Luther King, Jr. was when he became the leader of the most famous bus boycott in history? He was 26. You know how old Amelia Earhart was when she broke her first world record? 25 You know how old Steve Jobs was when he co-founded Apple Computer? 21 And you know how old Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were when they came up with their idea for the greatest superhero of all time, the first one, that they named "Superman"? These guys were 17 years old! Two 17-year-old kids created Superman. They weren't good looking. (Look at the picture, right?) They weren't popular. They had no money, but they were two best friends with one dream. And with just their imaginations, they gave the world Superman. And I know, creating Superman is a once-in-a-lifetime big dream, so I want to tell you about Alexandra Scott. She goes by Alex. Alex was diagnosed with cancer before she was even a year old, and that was the only life she knew: sickness, chemotherapy, and surgery. When she was four, Alex asked her parents could she put a lemonade stand in the front yard? She didn't want to buy anything for herself, she wanted to use the money to give it to doctors to help other kids with cancer. OK, in a single day, Alex's lemonade stand raised $2,000! But, here's what I love: soon after that, other lemonade stands started popping up, all with Alex's name on it. Eventually, they raised $200,000. And then Alex had a new goal. She said let's raise $1,000,000. On June 12, 2004, hundreds of lemonade stands started opening up in every state in the country. Ordinary people selling water and sugar and lemons to help kids with cancer. Nearly two months later, Alex died while her parents were holding her hands. She was 8 years old. But before she died, Alex said that next year's goal should be $5,000,000. Today, her dream has raised over $45,000,000 and it is still going strong! One idea, one girl, one big dream. And you know what she said? This is a direct quote before she died. She said, "Oh, we can do it! If other people will help me, I think we can do it. I know we can do it!" You dream big, I don't care how old you are, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise, you will change history. And that leads me to the second thing I tell my kids: work hard. Such a simple one, everyone knows this one. Work hard. I saw this one for my father and my father died a few months ago. When I was growing up in Brooklyn, ok, my father, he worked hard. He had no money, we had, no money growing up. He worked every Saturday, every Sunday. I watched first-hand every weekend what hard work was. And I saw that the hardest work of all is being resilient when you're facing failure. When I started writing my first book, my first book got me 24 rejection letters. To be clear, there are only 20 publishers, I got 24 rejection letters, OK? That means that some people were writing me twice to make sure I got the point. But it wasn't until I was writing my ninth book, a book of heroes for my son, that I found my favorite story of working hard through failure. It was a story that a friend told me about the Wright brothers. That every time the Wright brothers went out to fly their plane, they would bring enough extra materials for multiple crashes. That means for every time they went out, they knew they would fail. And they would crash and rebuild, and crash and rebuild, and that's why they took off. I love that story. I wanted my son to hear that story, I wanted my daughter to hear that story, I wanted everyone to know that if you dream big and you work hard and you fight failure, you will change history and do what no one on this planet has ever done before. And that leads me to the final thing I tell them: stay humble. Here's the thing: if you invent the world's first airplane, or Superman, or a multi-million dollar lemonade stand, you don't need to be humble. You can get a tattoo on your face that says, "I'm the best!" Right? But pay attention here: no one likes a jerk. In fact, the world needs fewer loudmouths, so stay humble! When Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, you know he never took credit for writing it while he was alive? It wasn't until he died and it was in his obituary that the average American found out that he was the author. That's humble. So there's the big secret: dream big, work hard, stay humble. "Wait," you're saying, "that's it?" "What, you tell me a bunch of stories and what? How do I change history?" Here's the answer: all history ever is is a bunch of stories, conflicting stories, big stories, little stories, our stories. So how do you change history? All you got to do is write your story. OK? No, I'm serious, this is it. If people think history is a bunch of facts and dates you got to memorize, that's not what history is at all. History is a selection process, and it chooses every single one of us every single day. The only question is, do you hear the call? And that leads me to the most important thing I'm going to tell you here: you will change history. Some of you will change it in big ways, affecting millions of people. Others of you will do it in more personal ways, helping a family member or someone who needs it. But let me tell you right now, one is not more important than the other. If you help people in mass or one-by-one, that's how history gets changed, when you take action. But when you start writing your story and you get scared, as we all inevitably do, I want you to know one thing: no one is born a hero. Every single person that we talked about today, whether they were a 26 year old preacher, or two 17 year old nerds, or little girl who had cancer, every single one of them had moments where they doubted themselves, like you, like me. They had moments where they worried about school and friendships and would they be accepted by others, like you, like me. They had moments where they worried about loneliness and failure and would they ever succeed, like you, like me. But the best part is, you don't have to start a multi-million dollar lemonade stand to change the world, all you got to do is help one person, be kind to one person, that's the answer. It's my core belief, it is in every story I just told you. I believe ordinary people change the world. I don't care how much money you have, I don't care where you go to school, that is all nonsense to me. I believe in regular people and their ability to affect change in this world. I believe in my father, and a 25 year old daredevil named Amelia, and a little girl who sells lemonade like nobody's business. And it's why I believe in that very first hero we were talking about today, Superman. To me, the most important part of the story isn't Superman. The most important part of the story is Clark Kent. And you want to know why? Because we're all Clark Kent. We all know what it's like to be boring and ordinary and wish we could do something incredibly beyond ourselves. But here's the real news: we all can do something incredibly beyond ourselves. I got 24 rejection letters on my first book, 24 people who told me to give it up, and I don't look back on the experience and say, "I was right, and they were wrong, and haha on them." What I look back and realize is that every single one of those rejection letters told me to work harder, to dream bigger, and you better believe it, made me more humble, but it also made me want it more than anything. So whatever it is you dream big about, whatever it is you work hard for, don't let anyone tell you, you're too young and don't let anyone tell you no. Every life makes history. And every life is a story. Thank you.

You know how old Amelia Earhart was when she broke her first world record? 25 You know how old Steve Jobs was when he co-founded Apple Computer? 21 And you know how old Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were when they came up with their idea for the greatest superhero of all time, the first one, that they named "Superman"? These guys were 17 years old! Two 17-year-old kids created Superman. They weren't good looking. (Look at the picture, right?) They weren't popular. They had no money, but they were two best friends with one dream. And with just their imaginations, they gave the world Superman. And I know, creating Superman is a once-in-a-lifetime big dream, so I want to tell you about Alexandra Scott. She goes by Alex. Alex was diagnosed with cancer before she was even a year old, and that was the only life she knew: sickness, chemotherapy, and surgery. When she was four, Alex asked her parents could she put a lemonade stand in the front yard? She didn't want to buy anything for herself, she wanted to use the money to give it to doctors to help other kids with cancer. OK, in a single day, Alex's lemonade stand raised $2,000! But, here's what I love: soon after that, other lemonade stands started popping up, all with Alex's name on it. Eventually, they raised $200,000. And then Alex had a new goal. She said let's raise $1,000,000. On June 12, 2004, hundreds of lemonade stands started opening up in every state in the country. Ordinary people selling water and sugar and lemons to help kids with cancer. Nearly two months later, Alex died while her parents were holding her hands. She was 8 years old. But before she died, Alex said that next year's goal should be $5,000,000. Today, her dream has raised over $45,000,000 and it is still going strong! One idea, one girl, one big dream. And you know what she said? This is a direct quote before she died. She said, "Oh, we can do it! If other people will help me, I think we can do it. I know we can do it!" You dream big, I don't care how old you are, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise, you will change history. And that leads me to the second thing I tell my kids: work hard. Such a simple one, everyone knows this one. Work hard. I saw this one for my father and my father died a few months ago. When I was growing up in Brooklyn, ok, my father, he worked hard. He had no money, we had, no money growing up. He worked every Saturday, every Sunday. I watched first-hand every weekend what hard work was. And I saw that the hardest work of all is being resilient when you're facing failure. When I started writing my first book, my first book got me 24 rejection letters. To be clear, there are only 20 publishers, I got 24 rejection letters, OK? That means that some people were writing me twice to make sure I got the point. But it wasn't until I was writing my ninth book, a book of heroes for my son, that I found my favorite story of working hard through failure. It was a story that a friend told me about the Wright brothers. That every time the Wright brothers went out to fly their plane, they would bring enough extra materials for multiple crashes. That means for every time they went out, they knew they would fail. And they would crash and rebuild, and crash and rebuild, and that's why they took off. I love that story. I wanted my son to hear that story, I wanted my daughter to hear that story, I wanted everyone to know that if you dream big and you work hard and you fight failure, you will change history and do what no one on this planet has ever done before. And that leads me to the final thing I tell them: stay humble. Here's the thing: if you invent the world's first airplane, or Superman, or a multi-million dollar lemonade stand, you don't need to be humble. You can get a tattoo on your face that says, "I'm the best!" Right? But pay attention here: no one likes a jerk. In fact, the world needs fewer loudmouths, so stay humble! When Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, you know he never took credit for writing it while he was alive? It wasn't until he died and it was in his obituary that the average American found out that he was the author. That's humble. So there's the big secret: dream big, work hard, stay humble. "Wait," you're saying, "that's it?" "What, you tell me a bunch of stories and what? How do I change history?" Here's the answer: all history ever is is a bunch of stories, conflicting stories, big stories, little stories, our stories. So how do you change history? All you got to do is write your story. OK? No, I'm serious, this is it. If people think history is a bunch of facts and dates you got to memorize, that's not what history is at all. History is a selection process, and it chooses every single one of us every single day. The only question is, do you hear the call? And that leads me to the most important thing I'm going to tell you here: you will change history. Some of you will change it in big ways, affecting millions of people. Others of you will do it in more personal ways, helping a family member or someone who needs it. But let me tell you right now, one is not more important than the other. If you help people in mass or one-by-one, that's how history gets changed, when you take action. But when you start writing your story and you get scared, as we all inevitably do, I want you to know one thing: no one is born a hero. Every single person that we talked about today, whether they were a 26 year old preacher, or two 17 year old nerds, or little girl who had cancer, every single one of them had moments where they doubted themselves, like you, like me. They had moments where they worried about school and friendships and would they be accepted by others, like you, like me. They had moments where they worried about loneliness and failure and would they ever succeed, like you, like me. But the best part is, you don't have to start a multi-million dollar lemonade stand to change the world, all you got to do is help one person, be kind to one person, that's the answer. It's my core belief, it is in every story I just told you. I believe ordinary people change the world. I don't care how much money you have, I don't care where you go to school, that is all nonsense to me. I believe in regular people and their ability to affect change in this world. I believe in my father, and a 25 year old daredevil named Amelia, and a little girl who sells lemonade like nobody's business. And it's why I believe in that very first hero we were talking about today, Superman. To me, the most important part of the story isn't Superman. The most important part of the story is Clark Kent. And you want to know why? Because we're all Clark Kent. We all know what it's like to be boring and ordinary and wish we could do something incredibly beyond ourselves. But here's the real news: we all can do something incredibly beyond ourselves. I got 24 rejection letters on my first book, 24 people who told me to give it up, and I don't look back on the experience and say, "I was right, and they were wrong, and haha on them." What I look back and realize is that every single one of those rejection letters told me to work harder, to dream bigger, and you better believe it, made me more humble, but it also made me want it more than anything. So whatever it is you dream big about, whatever it is you work hard for, don't let anyone tell you, you're too young and don't let anyone tell you no. Every life makes history. And every life is a story. Thank you.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You know what the greatest secret of history is? It's that history can be changed. And, yeah, yeah, I know, everyone says history can't be changed, but it can. And today we're going to talk about how history isn't just something that goes backwards, history goes forward too. And all those great things that haven't happened yet, that's history that's just waiting to be written. So how do you change history? I'm going to tell you by sharing with you the three things that I tell my kids every night when I tuck them into bed. It's true. I stole the idea from a friend of mine who told me what his father used to share with him.

No, I'm serious, this is it. If people think history is a bunch of facts and dates you got to memorize, that's not what history is at all. History is a selection process, and it chooses every single one of us every single day. The only question is, do you hear the call? And that leads me to the most important thing I'm going to tell you here: you will change history. Some of you will change it in big ways, affecting millions of people. Others of you will do it in more personal ways, helping a family member or someone who needs it. But let me tell you right now, one is not more important than the other. If you help people in mass or one-by-one, that's how history gets changed, when you take action. But when you start writing your story and you get scared, as we all inevitably do, I want you to know one thing: no one is born a hero. Every single person that we talked about today, whether they were a 26 year old preacher, or two 17 year old nerds, or little girl who had cancer, every single one of them had moments where they doubted themselves, like you, like me. They had moments where they worried about school and friendships and would they be accepted by others, like you, like me. They had moments where they worried about loneliness and failure and would they ever succeed, like you, like me. But the best part is, you don't have to start a multi-million dollar lemonade stand to change the world, all you got to do is help one person, be kind to one person, that's the answer. It's my core belief, it is in every story I just told you. I believe ordinary people change the world. I don't care how much money you have, I don't care where you go to school, that is all nonsense to me. I believe in regular people and their ability to affect change in this world. I believe in my father, and a 25 year old daredevil named Amelia, and a little girl who sells lemonade like nobody's business. And it's why I believe in that very first hero we were talking about today, Superman. To me, the most important part of the story isn't Superman. The most important part of the story is Clark Kent. And you want to know why? Because we're all Clark Kent. We all know what it's like to be boring and ordinary and wish we could do something incredibly beyond ourselves. But here's the real news: we all can do something incredibly beyond ourselves. I got 24 rejection letters on my first book, 24 people who told me to give it up, and I don't look back on the experience and say, "I was right, and they were wrong, and haha on them." What I look back and realize is that every single one of those rejection letters told me to work harder, to dream bigger, and you better believe it, made me more humble, but it also made me want it more than anything. So whatever it is you dream big about, whatever it is you work hard for, don't let anyone tell you, you're too young and don't let anyone tell you no. Every life makes history. And every life is a story. Thank you.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Once upon a time in the magical and very round Land of Pi, there lived six swashbuckling musketeers. There names were Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. But each was known best by his or her mark: the two hands ready to catch a fly of Parentheses, the small and raised digits of Exponents, the mighty X of Multiplication, slash of Division, plus of Addition, and, well, you can guess the symbol by which little Subtraction was best known. The Land of Pi was not necessarily the most peaceful place, and that's why the numbers of the kingdom needed the musketeers. The Land of Pi had been ruled by the numbers as anarcho-syndicalist commune, each number with a vote, but, one powerful number from what we'll call the Imperial Senate, engineered a war between some robot things and the knights of the kingdom, and then installed himself as Supreme Emperor, and then Puff the Magic Digit Dragon ate him, and a princess or two, and, well, all the other numbers in the Land of Pi actually. It was kind of a big day. Anyway, the musketeers were called to action to save the Land of Pi from the voracious dragon. They rode towards him on their valiant steeds and attacked. First Multiplication, then Parentheses, but that didn't work. The dragon continued eating people. So Addition tried, but was thrown aside. Exponents leaped at the beast and was quickly squashed. Nothing was working. The musketeers huddled and formulated a plan. They would attack in sequence, but who should go first? They bickered for a while, the dragon ate a few more princesses, and then they finally agreed. They jumped into the first, smallest parentheses inside the great Puff the Digit Dragon. Parentheses pointed out where to work first and protected Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction while they diced and sliced. First here, then, move over there, then there. Look out! There's another set! Parentheses pointed and Exponents took the lead. Then, it was Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction, each in turn, always the same order. P-E-M-D-A-S When they finished that set, they went to another, and another, always working inside the parentheses in PEMDAS order. Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! PEMDAS, there is another spot! Don't forget, there can be parentheses inside parentheses. There's one! And that tricky exponent. There we go! Finally, the PEMDAS Musketeers had whittled Puff down to his last fearsome roar. But, having vanquished Puff the Magic Digit Dragon, all the empire's numbers sprang again from this tiny little number one, and they all lived happily ever after. Except for the Emperor Number, which they threw into the mouth of an ancient nesting creature in the desert. The End.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match in terms of question content, but rather in terms of the story context.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what the numbers are afraid of, and the correct answer is "Puff the Magic Digit Dragon". While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the numbers' fear, Question 4: "Why did the musketeers initially fail to defeat the dragon?" is related to the story context where the dragon is the main antagonist.

However, a closer match is not found among the generated MCQs in terms of question intent and content.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, although it's not a direct match.

Look out! There's another set! Parentheses pointed and Exponents took the lead. Then, it was Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction, each in turn, always the same order. P-E-M-D-A-S When they finished that set, they went to another, and another, always working inside the parentheses in PEMDAS order. Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! PEMDAS, there is another spot! Don't forget, there can be parentheses inside parentheses. There's one! And that tricky exponent. There we go! Finally, the PEMDAS Musketeers had whittled Puff down to his last fearsome roar. But, having vanquished Puff the Magic Digit Dragon, all the empire's numbers sprang again from this tiny little number one, and they all lived happily ever after. Except for the Emperor Number, which they threw into the mouth of an ancient nesting creature in the desert. The End.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Once upon a time in the magical and very round Land of Pi, there lived six swashbuckling musketeers. There names were Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. But each was known best by his or her mark: the two hands ready to catch a fly of Parentheses, the small and raised digits of Exponents, the mighty X of Multiplication, slash of Division, plus of Addition, and, well, you can guess the symbol by which little Subtraction was best known. The Land of Pi was not necessarily the most peaceful place, and that's why the numbers of the kingdom needed the musketeers. The Land of Pi had been ruled by the numbers as anarcho-syndicalist commune, each number with a vote, but, one powerful number from what we'll call the Imperial Senate, engineered a war between some robot things and the knights of the kingdom, and then installed himself as Supreme Emperor, and then Puff the Magic Digit Dragon ate him, and a princess or two, and, well, all the other numbers in the Land of Pi actually. It was kind of a big day. Anyway, the musketeers were called to action to save the Land of Pi from the voracious dragon. They rode towards him on their valiant steeds and attacked. First Multiplication, then Parentheses, but that didn't work. The dragon continued eating people. So Addition tried, but was thrown aside. Exponents leaped at the beast and was quickly squashed. Nothing was working. The musketeers huddled and formulated a plan. They would attack in sequence, but who should go first? They bickered for a while, the dragon ate a few more princesses, and then they finally agreed. They jumped into the first, smallest parentheses inside the great Puff the Digit Dragon. Parentheses pointed out where to work first and protected Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction while they diced and sliced. First here, then, move over there, then there. Look out! There's another set! Parentheses pointed and Exponents took the lead. Then, it was Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction, each in turn, always the same order. P-E-M-D-A-S When they finished that set, they went to another, and another, always working inside the parentheses in PEMDAS order. Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! PEMDAS, there is another spot! Don't forget, there can be parentheses inside parentheses. There's one! And that tricky exponent. There we go! Finally, the PEMDAS Musketeers had whittled Puff down to his last fearsome roar. But, having vanquished Puff the Magic Digit Dragon, all the empire's numbers sprang again from this tiny little number one, and they all lived happily ever after. Except for the Emperor Number, which they threw into the mouth of an ancient nesting creature in the desert. The End.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept presented in the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the existence of parentheses inside parentheses, which is a specific aspect of the order of operations (PEMDAS). While there isn't a direct match, Question 1 mentions PEMDAS, and the transcript does mention "there can be parentheses inside parentheses."

However, a more suitable match would be a question that directly addresses the concept of nested parentheses. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs explicitly cover this topic.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would select Question 1, as it mentions PEMDAS, which is the context in which the concept of nested parentheses is discussed in the transcript.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 1

Please note that this is not a direct match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that explicitly addresses the concept of nested parentheses.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar 9th of January, 2007 Joshua Bell, one of the greatest violinist in the world, played to a packed audience at Boston's stately Symphony Hall of 1,000 people where most seats went for more than $100. He was used to full, sell-out shows. He was at the peak of his abilities and fame. Three days later, Joshua Bell played to an audience of nobody! Well, maybe six people paused for a moment, and one child stopped for a while looking, as if he understood that something special was happening. Joshua said of the experience, "It was a strange feeling that people were actually ignoring me." Joshua Bell was playing violin in a subway station. "At a music hall, I'll get upset if someone coughs or if someone's cell phone goes off, but here my expectations quickly diminished. I was oddly grateful when somebody threw in a dollar." What changed? Same music, on the same violin, played with the same passion and by the same man. Why did people listen and then not listen? Aristotle would be able to explain. What does it take to persuade people? 2,300 years ago, Aristotle wrote the single most important work on persuasion, Rhetoric, the 3 means of persuasion: logos, ethos, and pathos. Logos is that the idea makes sense from the audience's point of view. This is usually different from the speaker's point of view, so work needs to be done to make the idea relevant to the world view, the pains and the challenges of the listeners. A good argument is like good music. Good music follows some rules of composition; good arguments follow some rules of logic. It makes sense to the audience. Ethos is reputation, what are you known for; credibility, do you look and act professional; trustworthy, are your motives clear, do you show the listener that you care about them as much as yourself? Authority is confidence plus a concise message, a clear, strong voice. Pathos is the emotional connection. Stories are an effective human tool for creating an emotional connection. There are moments where an audience is not ready to hear the message. A speaker must create the right emotional environment for their message. What changed? Why did people travel for miles to hear him play one night, and not even pause for moment to listen the next morning? The answer is that ethos and pathos were missing. Ethos The fact that the great concert hall hosts Joshua's concert transfers its trust to Joshua. We trust the institution, we now trust Joshua. The subway does not have our trust for musical talent, we do not expect to find great art, great music, or great ideas, so it confers no trust to Joshua. Pathos The concert hall is designed for an emotional bond between an audience and an artist, a subway platform is not. The hustle and movement and stress is just not conducive to the emotional connection needed between performer and listener. Logos, ethos, pathos, the idea is nothing without the rest. This is what Joshua Bell learned on that cold, January day in 2007. If you have a great idea, how do you build credibility and emotional connection?

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar 9th of January, 2007 Joshua Bell, one of the greatest violinist in the world, played to a packed audience at Boston's stately Symphony Hall of 1,000 people where most seats went for more than $100. He was used to full, sell-out shows. He was at the peak of his abilities and fame. Three days later, Joshua Bell played to an audience of nobody! Well, maybe six people paused for a moment, and one child stopped for a while looking, as if he understood that something special was happening. Joshua said of the experience, "It was a strange feeling that people were actually ignoring me." Joshua Bell was playing violin in a subway station. "At a music hall, I'll get upset if someone coughs or if someone's cell phone goes off, but here my expectations quickly diminished. I was oddly grateful when somebody threw in a dollar." What changed? Same music, on the same violin, played with the same passion and by the same man. Why did people listen and then not listen? Aristotle would be able to explain. What does it take to persuade people? 2,300 years ago, Aristotle wrote the single most important work on persuasion, Rhetoric, the 3 means of persuasion: logos, ethos, and pathos. Logos is that the idea makes sense from the audience's point of view. This is usually different from the speaker's point of view, so work needs to be done to make the idea relevant to the world view, the pains and the challenges of the listeners. A good argument is like good music. Good music follows some rules of composition; good arguments follow some rules of logic. It makes sense to the audience. Ethos is reputation, what are you known for; credibility, do you look and act professional; trustworthy, are your motives clear, do you show the listener that you care about them as much as yourself? Authority is confidence plus a concise message, a clear, strong voice. Pathos is the emotional connection. Stories are an effective human tool for creating an emotional connection. There are moments where an audience is not ready to hear the message. A speaker must create the right emotional environment for their message. What changed? Why did people travel for miles to hear him play one night, and not even pause for moment to listen the next morning? The answer is that ethos and pathos were missing. Ethos The fact that the great concert hall hosts Joshua's concert transfers its trust to Joshua. We trust the institution, we now trust Joshua. The subway does not have our trust for musical talent, we do not expect to find great art, great music, or great ideas, so it confers no trust to Joshua. Pathos The concert hall is designed for an emotional bond between an audience and an artist, a subway platform is not. The hustle and movement and stress is just not conducive to the emotional connection needed between performer and listener. Logos, ethos, pathos, the idea is nothing without the rest. This is what Joshua Bell learned on that cold, January day in 2007. If you have a great idea, how do you build credibility and emotional connection?

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks for the three means of persuasion, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks which option is NOT a means of persuasion.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks which option is NOT a means of persuasion, with options that include the correct means of persuasion (logos, ethos, and pathos) and an incorrect option.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose:

**None of the above questions exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, a question that is somewhat related is Question 2.**

If I had to choose an index, I would choose **2**, but please note that this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

To create a more suitable match, I would suggest generating a new question that asks which option is NOT a means of persuasion, with options that include the correct means of persuasion (logos, ethos, and pathos) and an incorrect option, such as:

**Question: Which of the following is NOT a means of persuasion, according to Aristotle? Options: A. Logos, B. Eros, C. Ethos, D. Pathos Correct Option: B**

[Music] [Applause] good morning let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all Leonardo da Vinci we're all familiar with his fantastic work his drawings his paintings his inventions his writings but we do not know his face thousands of books have been written about him but there's controversy and it remains about his looks even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many other historians so what do you think is this the face of leonado Da Vinci or isn't it let's find out leonado was a man that Drew everything around him he drew people Anatomy plants animals Landscapes buildings water everything but no faces I find that hard to believe his contemporaries made faces like the ones you see here anas or 34s uh so surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time so let's try to find them I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits we would find his face looking at us so I looked at all of his drawings more than 700 and looked for male portraits there are about 120 you see them here which ones of these could be self-portraits well for that they have to be done as we just saw AAS or 3/ quarters so we can eliminate all the profiles it also has to be sufficiently detailed so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized and we know from his contemporaries that leonado was a very handsome even beautiful man so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures and look what happens only three candidates remain that fit the bill and here they are yes indeed the old man is there as is this famous pen drawing of the home of vranas and lastly the only portrait of a male that Leonard painted the musician and before we go into these faces I should explain why I have some right to talk about them I've made more than 1100 portraits myself for newspapers over the course of 300 30 years sorry 30 years only but there are 1100 and very few artists have drawn so many faces so I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces okay now let's look at these three portraits and hold on to your seats because if we zoom in on those faces remark how they have the same broad forehead the horizontal eyebrows the long nose the curved lips and the small well-developed chin I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that there is no reason why these portraits should look alike all we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait and look they do are very similar now are they made in the right order the young men should be made first and as you see here from the years that they were created it is indeed the case they are made in the right order what was the age of Leonardo at the time does that fit yes it does he was 33 38 and 63 when these were made so we have three pictures potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at that time but how do we know it's him and not someone else well we need a reference and here's the only the only picture of Leonardo that's why be accepted it's a statue made by veroo of David for which Leonard posed as a boy of 15 and if we now compare the face of the statue with the face of the musician you see the very same features again the statue is the reference and it connects the identity of leonado to those three faces ladies and gentlemen this story has not yet had been published it's only proper that you hear a t hear and see it first the icon of icons finally has a face here he is Leonardo [Music] DaVinci

**Transcript**:
it's a simple idea about nature and I want to I want to say a word for nature because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days I want to say a word for the soil and the bees the plants and the animals and tell you about a tool a very simple tool that I have found although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit it's not a technology is very powerful for I think changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend and that tool is very simply as Chris suggested looking at us and the world from the plants or the animals point of view it's not my idea other peoples have hit on it but I've tried to take it to some new places let me tell you where I got it like a lot of my ideas like a lot of the tools I use I found it in the garden I'm a very devoted gardener and there was a day about seven years ago I was planting potatoes it was the first week of May this is New England when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom they're just white clouds above I was here planting my chunks cutting up potatoes and planting it and the bees were working on this tree bumblebees just making this thing vibrate and one of the things I really like about gardening is that it doesn't take all your concentration you really can't get hurt it's not like woodworking and you can you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation and the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden was working alongside that bumblebee was what did I and that bumblebee have in common how was our role in this garden similar and different and I realized we actually had quite a bit in common both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another and both of us probably if I can imagine the bees point of view thought we were calling the shots I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant I picked my Yukon gold or yellow fin or whatever it was and I had some in those jeans from a seed catalog across the country brought it and I was planting it and that'd be no doubt assumed that it had decided I'm going for that apple tree I'm going for that blossom I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave we have a grammar that suggests that's who we are that we are sovereign subjects in nature the bee as well as me I plant the potatoes I weed the garden I domesticate the species but that day it occurred to me what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit because of course the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge and but we know better we know that what's going on between the B and that flower is that B has been cleverly manipulated by that flower and when I say manipulated I'm talking about in Darwinian sense right I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits color scent flavor pattern that has lured that B in and the B has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar and also picking up some powder on its leg and going off to the next blossom B is not calling the shots and I realized then I wasn't either I had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its into spreading its genes give me a little bit more habitat and that's when I got the idea which was what would it be what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who were working on us and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention not as a human technology but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species mostly edible grasses had exploited us figured out how to get us to basically DeForest the world the competition of grasses right and suddenly everything looked different and suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience I had thought always and in fact had written this in my first book was a book about gardening that lawns were nature under cultures but-- that they were totalitarian landscapes and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing this species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex and and that's what the lawn was but then I realize no this is exactly what the grasses want us to do I'm a dupe I'm a dupe of the lawns whose goal in life is to out-compete the trees who it competes with who they compete with for sunlight and so by getting us to mow the lawn we keep the trees from coming back which in in New England happens very very quickly so I started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called the bottom desire and I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the tastes and the desires of bees that they like sweetness that they like this color and not that color that they like symmetry what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing that a certain kind of potato a certain kind of drug a sativa indica cannabis cross has something to say about us and that wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world now the test of any idea I said it was a literary conceit is what does it get us and when you're talking about nature which is really my subject as a writer how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test which is does it make us better citizens of the biotic community get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota rather than its destruction and I would submit that this idea does this so let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way besides some you know entertaining insights about about human desire as an intellectual matter looking at the world from other species points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly which is intellection this is in the realm of intellectual history which is that we had this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago mini-me we have this intellectual referal this Darwinian revolution in which thanks to Darwin we figured out we are just one species among many evolutions working on us the same way it's working on all the others we are acted upon as well as acting we are really in the fiber of the fabric of life but the weird thing is we don't we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later none of us really believes this we are still Cartesians the children of Descartes who believe that subjectivity consciousness sets us apart that the world is divided into subjects and objects that there is nature on one side culture on another as soon as you start seeing things from the plan's point of view or the animals point of view you realize that the real literary conceit is that is this the idea that nature is opposed to culture the idea that that that consciousness is everything and that's another very important thing it does looking at the world from other species points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance you suddenly realize that consciousness which we value and we consider the you know the crown of the crowning achievement of nature human consciousness is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world and it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool but you know there's a comedian who said well who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important well consciousness so when you look at the plants you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting I'll give you two examples also from the garden lima beans you know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mic that comes in and attacks the spider mite defending the lima bean so what plants have while we have consciousness tool-making language they have biochemistry and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond can imagine and their complexity their sophistication is something to really marvel at and I think it's really the scandal of the human genome project you know we went into it thinking forty or fifty thousand human genes we came out with the only twenty three thousand just to give you a grounds for comparison rice 35,000 genes so who's the more sophisticated species well we're all equally sophisticated we've been involving evolving just as long just along different paths so cure for self-importance weight of sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea and that's really what I do as a writer as a storyteller is try to make people kind of feel what we know and tell stories that actually make us help us think ecologically now the other use of this is practical and I'm in tucked I'm going to take you to a farm right now as I use this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned in fact is that we are all now being manipulated by corn and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today to me is the final triumph of corn over good sense it is part of corns corn scheme for world domination and you will see the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us so but let me so it helped me understand industrial agriculture which of course is a Cartesian system it's based on this idea that we Bend other species to our will and that we are in charge and then we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want let me take you to a very different kind of farm this is farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species point of view are actually implemented and I found it in a man the farmers name is Joel Salatin and I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature and that is this the farm is called Polyface which means the idea is he's got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement it's permaculture those of you know a little bit about this such that the cows and the pigs and the em and the sheep and the turkeys and the what else what else does he have all the six different species rabbits actually are all performing ecological services for one another such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another and I can't it's a very elaborate and beautiful dance but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens his laying hens and I'll show you how if you take this approach what you get okay and this is a lot more than growing food as you'll see this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion that the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning and that for us to get what we want nature is diminished so one day cattle in a pen the only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing relatively new up to a car battery even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock set it up in 15 minutes cows graze one day they move okay they graze everything down intensive intensive grazing he waits three days and then we towed in something called the egg mobile the egg mobile is a very rickety contraption it looks like a Prairie schooner made out of boards but it houses 350 chickens he tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank turns them down and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank clucking gossiping as chickens will and they make a beeline for the cow patties and what they're doing is very interesting they're digging through the cow patties for the maggots the grub the larvae of flies and the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens favorite form of protein so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and there they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs and in the process they're spreading the manure out very useful at second echo system service and third while they're in this paddock there are of course defecating madly and and they're very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field they then move out to the next one and in the course of just a few weeks the grass just enters his blaze of growth and within four or five weeks he can do it again he can graze again you can cut they could bring in another species like the Lambs or he can um make hay for the winter now I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there so it's a very productive system and what I need to tell you is that on a hundred acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef 30,000 pounds of pork 25,000 dozen eggs 20,000 boilers a thousand turkeys a thousand rabbits an immense amount of food you know you here can organic feed the world well look how much food can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of again give each species what it want let it really realize its desires its physiological distinctiveness put that in play but look at it from the point of view of the grass now what happens to the grass when you do this when a ruminant grazes grass the grass is cut from this height to this height and it immediately does something very interesting anyone of you who Gardens knows that there is something called the root shoot ratio and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots they kind of cauterize them and the roots die and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots decomposing them the earthworms the fungi the bacteria and the result is new soil this is how soil is created it's created from the bottom up this is how the prairies were built the relationship between bison and grasses and what I realized when I understood this and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer he's not a sheep farmer he's not a cattle rancher he's a grass farmer because grass is really the keystone species of such a system is that if you think about it this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads which is that for us to get what we want nature is diminished more for us less for nature here all this food comes off this farm and at the end of the season there is actually more soil more fertility and more biodiversity it's a remarkably hopeful thing to do there are a lot of farmers doing this today this is well beyond organic agriculture which is still a Cartesian system more or less and what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species take account of the soil that even with with enough more than this perspectival idea because there is no technology involved here except for those fences which could be you know they're so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time that you can we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process this this is a way to reanimate the world and that's what's so exciting about this perspective when we really begin to feel darwin's insights in our bones the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very helpful about thank you very much

**Transcript**:
it's a simple idea about nature and I want to I want to say a word for nature because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days I want to say a word for the soil and the bees the plants and the animals and tell you about a tool a very simple tool that I have found although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit it's not a technology is very powerful for I think changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend and that tool is very simply as Chris suggested looking at us and the world from the plants or the animals point of view it's not my idea other peoples have hit on it but I've tried to take it to some new places let me tell you where I got it like a lot of my ideas like a lot of the tools I use I found it in the garden I'm a very devoted gardener and there was a day about seven years ago I was planting potatoes it was the first week of May this is New England when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom they're just white clouds above I was here planting my chunks cutting up potatoes and planting it and the bees were working on this tree bumblebees just making this thing vibrate and one of the things I really like about gardening is that it doesn't take all your concentration you really can't get hurt it's not like woodworking and you can you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation and the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden was working alongside that bumblebee was what did I and that bumblebee have in common how was our role in this garden similar and different and I realized we actually had quite a bit in common both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another and both of us probably if I can imagine the bees point of view thought we were calling the shots I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant I picked my Yukon gold or yellow fin or whatever it was and I had some in those jeans from a seed catalog across the country brought it and I was planting it and that'd be no doubt assumed that it had decided I'm going for that apple tree I'm going for that blossom I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave we have a grammar that suggests that's who we are that we are sovereign subjects in nature the bee as well as me I plant the potatoes I weed the garden I domesticate the species but that day it occurred to me what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit because of course the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge and but we know better we know that what's going on between the B and that flower is that B has been cleverly manipulated by that flower and when I say manipulated I'm talking about in Darwinian sense right I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits color scent flavor pattern that has lured that B in and the B has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar and also picking up some powder on its leg and going off to the next blossom B is not calling the shots and I realized then I wasn't either I had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its into spreading its genes give me a little bit more habitat and that's when I got the idea which was what would it be what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who were working on us and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention not as a human technology but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species mostly edible grasses had exploited us figured out how to get us to basically DeForest the world the competition of grasses right and suddenly everything looked different and suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience I had thought always and in fact had written this in my first book was a book about gardening that lawns were nature under cultures but-- that they were totalitarian landscapes and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing this species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex and and that's what the lawn was but then I realize no this is exactly what the grasses want us to do I'm a dupe I'm a dupe of the lawns whose goal in life is to out-compete the trees who it competes with who they compete with for sunlight and so by getting us to mow the lawn we keep the trees from coming back which in in New England happens very very quickly so I started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called the bottom desire and I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the tastes and the desires of bees that they like sweetness that they like this color and not that color that they like symmetry what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing that a certain kind of potato a certain kind of drug a sativa indica cannabis cross has something to say about us and that wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world now the test of any idea I said it was a literary conceit is what does it get us and when you're talking about nature which is really my subject as a writer how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test which is does it make us better citizens of the biotic community get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota rather than its destruction and I would submit that this idea does this so let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way besides some you know entertaining insights about about human desire as an intellectual matter looking at the world from other species points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly which is intellection this is in the realm of intellectual history which is that we had this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago mini-me we have this intellectual referal this Darwinian revolution in which thanks to Darwin we figured out we are just one species among many evolutions working on us the same way it's working on all the others we are acted upon as well as acting we are really in the fiber of the fabric of life but the weird thing is we don't we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later none of us really believes this we are still Cartesians the children of Descartes who believe that subjectivity consciousness sets us apart that the world is divided into subjects and objects that there is nature on one side culture on another as soon as you start seeing things from the plan's point of view or the animals point of view you realize that the real literary conceit is that is this the idea that nature is opposed to culture the idea that that that consciousness is everything and that's another very important thing it does looking at the world from other species points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance you suddenly realize that consciousness which we value and we consider the you know the crown of the crowning achievement of nature human consciousness is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world and it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool but you know there's a comedian who said well who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important well consciousness so when you look at the plants you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting I'll give you two examples also from the garden lima beans you know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mic that comes in and attacks the spider mite defending the lima bean so what plants have while we have consciousness tool-making language they have biochemistry and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond can imagine and their complexity their sophistication is something to really marvel at and I think it's really the scandal of the human genome project you know we went into it thinking forty or fifty thousand human genes we came out with the only twenty three thousand just to give you a grounds for comparison rice 35,000 genes so who's the more sophisticated species well we're all equally sophisticated we've been involving evolving just as long just along different paths so cure for self-importance weight of sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea and that's really what I do as a writer as a storyteller is try to make people kind of feel what we know and tell stories that actually make us help us think ecologically now the other use of this is practical and I'm in tucked I'm going to take you to a farm right now as I use this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned in fact is that we are all now being manipulated by corn and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today to me is the final triumph of corn over good sense it is part of corns corn scheme for world domination and you will see the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us so but let me so it helped me understand industrial agriculture which of course is a Cartesian system it's based on this idea that we Bend other species to our will and that we are in charge and then we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want let me take you to a very different kind of farm this is farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species point of view are actually implemented and I found it in a man the farmers name is Joel Salatin and I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature and that is this the farm is called Polyface which means the idea is he's got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement it's permaculture those of you know a little bit about this such that the cows and the pigs and the em and the sheep and the turkeys and the what else what else does he have all the six different species rabbits actually are all performing ecological services for one another such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another and I can't it's a very elaborate and beautiful dance but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens his laying hens and I'll show you how if you take this approach what you get okay and this is a lot more than growing food as you'll see this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion that the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning and that for us to get what we want nature is diminished so one day cattle in a pen the only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing relatively new up to a car battery even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock set it up in 15 minutes cows graze one day they move okay they graze everything down intensive intensive grazing he waits three days and then we towed in something called the egg mobile the egg mobile is a very rickety contraption it looks like a Prairie schooner made out of boards but it houses 350 chickens he tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank turns them down and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank clucking gossiping as chickens will and they make a beeline for the cow patties and what they're doing is very interesting they're digging through the cow patties for the maggots the grub the larvae of flies and the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens favorite form of protein so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and there they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs and in the process they're spreading the manure out very useful at second echo system service and third while they're in this paddock there are of course defecating madly and and they're very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field they then move out to the next one and in the course of just a few weeks the grass just enters his blaze of growth and within four or five weeks he can do it again he can graze again you can cut they could bring in another species like the Lambs or he can um make hay for the winter now I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there so it's a very productive system and what I need to tell you is that on a hundred acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef 30,000 pounds of pork 25,000 dozen eggs 20,000 boilers a thousand turkeys a thousand rabbits an immense amount of food you know you here can organic feed the world well look how much food can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of again give each species what it want let it really realize its desires its physiological distinctiveness put that in play but look at it from the point of view of the grass now what happens to the grass when you do this when a ruminant grazes grass the grass is cut from this height to this height and it immediately does something very interesting anyone of you who Gardens knows that there is something called the root shoot ratio and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots they kind of cauterize them and the roots die and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots decomposing them the earthworms the fungi the bacteria and the result is new soil this is how soil is created it's created from the bottom up this is how the prairies were built the relationship between bison and grasses and what I realized when I understood this and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer he's not a sheep farmer he's not a cattle rancher he's a grass farmer because grass is really the keystone species of such a system is that if you think about it this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads which is that for us to get what we want nature is diminished more for us less for nature here all this food comes off this farm and at the end of the season there is actually more soil more fertility and more biodiversity it's a remarkably hopeful thing to do there are a lot of farmers doing this today this is well beyond organic agriculture which is still a Cartesian system more or less and what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species take account of the soil that even with with enough more than this perspectival idea because there is no technology involved here except for those fences which could be you know they're so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time that you can we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process this this is a way to reanimate the world and that's what's so exciting about this perspective when we really begin to feel darwin's insights in our bones the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very helpful about thank you very much

comedian who said well who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important well consciousness so when you look at the plants you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting I'll give you two examples also from the garden lima beans you know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mic that comes in and attacks the spider mite defending the lima bean so what plants have while we have consciousness tool-making language they have biochemistry and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond can imagine and their complexity their sophistication is something to really marvel at and I think it's really the scandal of the human genome project you know we went into it thinking forty or fifty thousand human genes we came out with the only twenty three thousand just to give you a grounds for comparison rice 35,000 genes so who's the more sophisticated species well we're all equally sophisticated we've been involving evolving just as long just along different paths so cure for self-importance weight of sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea and that's really what I do as a writer as a storyteller is try to make people kind of feel what we know and tell stories that actually make us help us think ecologically now the other use of this is practical and I'm in tucked I'm going to take you to a farm right now as I use this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned in fact is that we are all now

the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us so but let me so it helped me understand industrial agriculture which of course is a Cartesian system it's based on this idea that we Bend other species to our will and that we are in charge and then we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want let me take you to a very different kind of farm this is farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species point of view are actually implemented and I found it in a man the farmers name is Joel Salatin and I spent a week as

course of just a few weeks the grass just enters his blaze of growth and within four or five weeks he can do it again he can graze again you can cut they could bring in another species like the Lambs or he can um make hay for the winter now I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there so it's a very productive system and what I need to tell you is that on a hundred acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef 30,000 pounds of pork 25,000 dozen eggs 20,000 boilers a thousand turkeys a thousand rabbits an immense amount of food you know you here can organic feed the world well look how much food can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of again give each species what it want let it really realize its desires its physiological distinctiveness put that in play but look at it from the point of view of the grass now what happens to the grass when you do this when a ruminant grazes grass the grass is cut from this height to this height and it immediately does something very interesting anyone of you who Gardens knows that there is something called the root shoot ratio and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots they kind of cauterize them and the roots die and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots decomposing them the earthworms the fungi the bacteria and the result is new soil this is how soil is created it's created from the bottom up this is how the prairies were built the relationship between bison and grasses and what I realized when I understood this and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer he's not a sheep farmer he's not a cattle rancher he's a grass farmer because grass is really the keystone species of such a system is that if you think about it this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads which is that for us to get what we want nature is diminished more for us less for nature here all this food comes off this farm and at the end of the season there is actually more soil more fertility and more biodiversity it's a remarkably hopeful thing to do there are a lot of farmers doing this today this is well beyond organic agriculture which is still a Cartesian system more or less and what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species take account of the soil that even with with enough more than this perspectival idea because there is no technology involved here except for those fences which could be you know they're so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time that you can we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process this this is a way to reanimate the world and that's what's so exciting about this perspective when we really begin to feel darwin's insights in our bones the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very helpful about thank you very much

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ in terms of discussing the natural world and the relationships between species.

However, a more similar question is not present in the list. The ground truth MCQ specifically asks about lima beans and their defense mechanism against spider mites. None of the generated MCQs match this question.

If I had to choose the most similar question based on the broader topic of species relationships and natural mechanisms, I would choose Question 7, which discusses the relationship between the bumblebee and the flower. However, this is still not a close match.

Therefore, I must conclude that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

Index: No match (or Question 7 as a very loose match)

**Transcript**:
it's a simple idea about nature and I want to I want to say a word for nature because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days I want to say a word for the soil and the bees the plants and the animals and tell you about a tool a very simple tool that I have found although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit it's not a technology is very powerful for I think changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend and that tool is very simply as Chris suggested looking at us and the world from the plants or the animals point of view it's not my idea other peoples have hit on it but I've tried to take it to some new places let me tell you where I got it like a lot of my ideas like a lot of the tools I use I found it in the garden I'm a very devoted gardener and there was a day about seven years ago I was planting potatoes it was the first week of May this is New England when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom they're just white clouds above I was here planting my chunks cutting up potatoes and planting it and the bees were working on this tree bumblebees just making this thing vibrate and one of the things I really like about gardening is that it doesn't take all your concentration you really can't get hurt it's not like woodworking and you can you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation and the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden was working alongside that bumblebee was what did I and that bumblebee have in common how was our role in this garden similar and different and I realized we actually had quite a bit in common both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another and both of us probably if I can imagine the bees point of view thought we were calling the shots I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant I picked my Yukon gold or yellow fin or whatever it was and I had some in those jeans from a seed catalog across the country brought it and I was planting it and that'd be no doubt assumed that it had decided I'm going for that apple tree I'm going for that blossom I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave we have a grammar that suggests that's who we are that we are sovereign subjects in nature the bee as well as me I plant the potatoes I weed the garden I domesticate the species but that day it occurred to me what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit because of course the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge and but we know better we know that what's going on between the B and that flower is that B has been cleverly manipulated by that flower and when I say manipulated I'm talking about in Darwinian sense right I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits color scent flavor pattern that has lured that B in and the B has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar and also picking up some powder on its leg and going off to the next blossom B is not calling the shots and I realized then I wasn't either I had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its into spreading its genes give me a little bit more habitat and that's when I got the idea which was what would it be what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who were working on us and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention not as a human technology but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species mostly edible grasses had exploited us figured out how to get us to basically DeForest the world the competition of grasses right and suddenly everything looked different and suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience I had thought always and in fact had written this in my first book was a book about gardening that lawns were nature under cultures but-- that they were totalitarian landscapes and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing this species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex and and that's what the lawn was but then I realize no this is exactly what the grasses want us to do I'm a dupe I'm a dupe of the lawns whose goal in life is to out-compete the trees who it competes with who they compete with for sunlight and so by getting us to mow the lawn we keep the trees from coming back which in in New England happens very very quickly so I started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called the bottom desire and I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the tastes and the desires of bees that they like sweetness that they like this color and not that color that they like symmetry what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing that a certain kind of potato a certain kind of drug a sativa indica cannabis cross has something to say about us and that wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world now the test of any idea I said it was a literary conceit is what does it get us and when you're talking about nature which is really my subject as a writer how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test which is does it make us better citizens of the biotic community get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota rather than its destruction and I would submit that this idea does this so let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way besides some you know entertaining insights about about human desire as an intellectual matter looking at the world from other species points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly which is intellection this is in the realm of intellectual history which is that we had this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago mini-me we have this intellectual referal this Darwinian revolution in which thanks to Darwin we figured out we are just one species among many evolutions working on us the same way it's working on all the others we are acted upon as well as acting we are really in the fiber of the fabric of life but the weird thing is we don't we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later none of us really believes this we are still Cartesians the children of Descartes who believe that subjectivity consciousness sets us apart that the world is divided into subjects and objects that there is nature on one side culture on another as soon as you start seeing things from the plan's point of view or the animals point of view you realize that the real literary conceit is that is this the idea that nature is opposed to culture the idea that that that consciousness is everything and that's another very important thing it does looking at the world from other species points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance you suddenly realize that consciousness which we value and we consider the you know the crown of the crowning achievement of nature human consciousness is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world and it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool but you know there's a comedian who said well who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important well consciousness so when you look at the plants you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting I'll give you two examples also from the garden lima beans you know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mic that comes in and attacks the spider mite defending the lima bean so what plants have while we have consciousness tool-making language they have biochemistry and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond can imagine and their complexity their sophistication is something to really marvel at and I think it's really the scandal of the human genome project you know we went into it thinking forty or fifty thousand human genes we came out with the only twenty three thousand just to give you a grounds for comparison rice 35,000 genes so who's the more sophisticated species well we're all equally sophisticated we've been involving evolving just as long just along different paths so cure for self-importance weight of sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea and that's really what I do as a writer as a storyteller is try to make people kind of feel what we know and tell stories that actually make us help us think ecologically now the other use of this is practical and I'm in tucked I'm going to take you to a farm right now as I use this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned in fact is that we are all now being manipulated by corn and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today to me is the final triumph of corn over good sense it is part of corns corn scheme for world domination and you will see the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us so but let me so it helped me understand industrial agriculture which of course is a Cartesian system it's based on this idea that we Bend other species to our will and that we are in charge and then we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want let me take you to a very different kind of farm this is farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species point of view are actually implemented and I found it in a man the farmers name is Joel Salatin and I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature and that is this the farm is called Polyface which means the idea is he's got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement it's permaculture those of you know a little bit about this such that the cows and the pigs and the em and the sheep and the turkeys and the what else what else does he have all the six different species rabbits actually are all performing ecological services for one another such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another and I can't it's a very elaborate and beautiful dance but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens his laying hens and I'll show you how if you take this approach what you get okay and this is a lot more than growing food as you'll see this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion that the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning and that for us to get what we want nature is diminished so one day cattle in a pen the only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing relatively new up to a car battery even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock set it up in 15 minutes cows graze one day they move okay they graze everything down intensive intensive grazing he waits three days and then we towed in something called the egg mobile the egg mobile is a very rickety contraption it looks like a Prairie schooner made out of boards but it houses 350 chickens he tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank turns them down and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank clucking gossiping as chickens will and they make a beeline for the cow patties and what they're doing is very interesting they're digging through the cow patties for the maggots the grub the larvae of flies and the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens favorite form of protein so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and there they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs and in the process they're spreading the manure out very useful at second echo system service and third while they're in this paddock there are of course defecating madly and and they're very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field they then move out to the next one and in the course of just a few weeks the grass just enters his blaze of growth and within four or five weeks he can do it again he can graze again you can cut they could bring in another species like the Lambs or he can um make hay for the winter now I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there so it's a very productive system and what I need to tell you is that on a hundred acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef 30,000 pounds of pork 25,000 dozen eggs 20,000 boilers a thousand turkeys a thousand rabbits an immense amount of food you know you here can organic feed the world well look how much food can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of again give each species what it want let it really realize its desires its physiological distinctiveness put that in play but look at it from the point of view of the grass now what happens to the grass when you do this when a ruminant grazes grass the grass is cut from this height to this height and it immediately does something very interesting anyone of you who Gardens knows that there is something called the root shoot ratio and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots they kind of cauterize them and the roots die and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots decomposing them the earthworms the fungi the bacteria and the result is new soil this is how soil is created it's created from the bottom up this is how the prairies were built the relationship between bison and grasses and what I realized when I understood this and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer he's not a sheep farmer he's not a cattle rancher he's a grass farmer because grass is really the keystone species of such a system is that if you think about it this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads which is that for us to get what we want nature is diminished more for us less for nature here all this food comes off this farm and at the end of the season there is actually more soil more fertility and more biodiversity it's a remarkably hopeful thing to do there are a lot of farmers doing this today this is well beyond organic agriculture which is still a Cartesian system more or less and what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species take account of the soil that even with with enough more than this perspectival idea because there is no technology involved here except for those fences which could be you know they're so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time that you can we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process this this is a way to reanimate the world and that's what's so exciting about this perspective when we really begin to feel darwin's insights in our bones the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very helpful about thank you very much

at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the tastes and the desires of bees that they like sweetness that they like this color and not that color that they like symmetry what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing that a certain kind of potato a certain kind of drug a sativa indica cannabis cross has something to say about us and that wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world now the test of any idea I said it was a literary conceit is what does it get us and when you're talking about nature which is really my subject as a writer how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test which is does it make us better citizens of the biotic community get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota rather than its destruction and I would submit that this idea does this so let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way besides some you know entertaining insights about about human desire as an intellectual matter looking at the world from other species points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly which is intellection this is in the realm of intellectual history which is that we had this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago mini-me we have this intellectual referal this Darwinian revolution in which thanks to Darwin we figured out we are just one species among many evolutions working on us the same way it's working on all the others we are acted upon as well as acting we are really in the fiber of the fabric of life but the weird thing is we don't we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later none of us really believes this we are still Cartesians the children of Descartes who believe that subjectivity consciousness sets us apart that the world is divided into subjects and objects that there is nature on one side culture on another as soon as you start seeing things from the plan's point of view or the animals point of view you realize that the real literary conceit is that is this the idea that nature is opposed to culture the idea that that that consciousness is everything and that's another very important thing it does looking at the world from other species points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance you suddenly realize that consciousness which we value and we consider the you know the crown of the crowning achievement of nature human consciousness is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world and it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool but you know there's a comedian who said well who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important well consciousness so when you look at the plants you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting I'll give you two examples also from the garden lima beans you know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mic that comes in and attacks the spider mite defending the lima bean so what plants have while we have consciousness tool-making language they have biochemistry and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond can imagine and their complexity their sophistication is something to really marvel at and I think it's really the scandal of the human genome project you know we went into it thinking forty or fifty thousand human genes we came out with the only twenty three thousand just to give you a grounds for comparison rice 35,000 genes so who's the more sophisticated species well we're all equally sophisticated we've been involving evolving just as long just along different paths so cure for self-importance weight of sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea and that's really what I do as a writer as a storyteller is try to make people kind of feel what we know and tell stories that actually make us help us think ecologically now the other use of this is practical and I'm in tucked I'm going to take you to a farm right now as I use this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned in fact is that we are all now being manipulated by corn and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today to me is the final triumph of corn over good sense it is part of corns corn scheme for world domination and you will see the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us so but let me so it helped me understand industrial agriculture which of course is a Cartesian system it's based on this idea that we Bend other species to our will and that we are in charge and then we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want let me take you to a very different kind of farm this is farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species point of view are actually implemented and I found it in a man the farmers name is Joel Salatin and I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature and that is this the farm is called Polyface which means the idea is he's got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement it's permaculture those of you know a little bit about this such that the cows and the pigs and the em and the sheep and the turkeys and the what else what else does he have all the six different species rabbits actually are all performing ecological services for one another such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another and I can't it's a very elaborate and beautiful dance but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens his laying hens and I'll show you how if you take this approach what you get okay and this is a lot more than growing food as you'll see this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion that the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning and that for us to get what we want nature is diminished so one day cattle in a pen the only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing relatively new up to a car battery even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock set it up in 15 minutes cows graze one day they move okay they graze everything down intensive intensive grazing he waits three days and then we towed in something called the egg mobile the egg mobile is a very rickety contraption it looks like a Prairie schooner made out of boards but it houses 350 chickens he tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank turns them down and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank clucking gossiping as chickens will and they make a beeline for the cow patties and what they're doing is very interesting they're digging through the cow patties for the maggots the grub the larvae of flies and the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens favorite form of protein so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and there they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs and in the process they're spreading the manure out very useful at second echo system service and third while they're in this paddock there are of course defecating madly and and they're very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field they then move out to the next one and in the course of just a few weeks the grass just enters his blaze of growth and within four or five weeks he can do it again he can graze again you can cut they could bring in another species like the Lambs or he can um make hay for the winter now I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there so it's a very productive system and what I need to tell you is that on a hundred acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef 30,000 pounds of pork 25,000 dozen eggs 20,000 boilers a thousand turkeys a thousand rabbits an immense amount of food you know you here can organic feed the world well look how much food can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of again give each species what it want let it really realize its desires its physiological distinctiveness put that in play but look at it from the point of view of the grass now what happens to the grass when you do this when a ruminant grazes grass the grass is cut from this height to this height and it immediately does something very interesting anyone of you who Gardens knows that there is something called the root shoot ratio and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots they kind of cauterize them and the roots die and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots decomposing them the earthworms the fungi the bacteria and the result is new soil this is how soil is created it's created from the bottom up this is how the prairies were built the relationship between bison and grasses and what I realized when I understood this and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer he's not a sheep farmer he's not a cattle rancher he's a grass farmer because grass is really the keystone species of such a system is that if you think about it this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads which is that for us to get what we want nature is diminished more for us less for nature here all this food comes off this farm and at the end of the season there is actually more soil more fertility and more biodiversity it's a remarkably hopeful thing to do there are a lot of farmers doing this today this is well beyond organic agriculture which is still a Cartesian system more or less and what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species take account of the soil that even with with enough more than this perspectival idea because there is no technology involved here except for those fences which could be you know they're so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time that you can we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process this this is a way to reanimate the world and that's what's so exciting about this perspective when we really begin to feel darwin's insights in our bones the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very helpful about thank you very much

[Music] [Applause] we're going to go on a dive to the deep sea and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity knows that for the about two and a half hours on the way down it's a perfectly positively pitch black world and we used to see the most mysterious animals out there window that you couldn't describe these blinking lights a world of bioluminescence like fireflies Dr Edith Witter she's now at the ocean research and Conservation Association was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals and that's what you're seeing here on the screen that's all bioluminescence like I said just like fireflies there's a flying turkey under turkey I don't I yeah I I'm I'm a geologist by training uh but I love that uh and you see some of the some of the luminescence they used to avoid being eaten some they used to attract prey but all of it from an artistic point of view is just positively amazing and a lot of what goes on inside there's a fish with glowing eyes pulsating eyes some some of the colors are designed to hypnotize these lovely patterns and then this last one one of my favorites this pin wheel design just absolutely amazing every single dive that's the unknown world and today we've only explored about 3% 3% of what's out there in the ocean already we found the world's highest mountains world's deepest valleys underwater Lakes underwater waterfalls a lot of that we shared with you from the stage and in a place where we thought no life at all we find more life we think and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest which tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all there's still 97% and either that 97% is empty or just full of surprises but I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing the seapods head foots as a kid I knew them as calamari mostly but this is an octopus this is a work of Dr Roger hanin at the Marine biological lab and just fascinating how how seop pods can with their eyes incredible eyes sense their surrounding look at light look at patterns here's an octopus moving across the reef finds a spot to settle down curls up and then disappears into the background tough thing to do in the next bit we're going to see a couple of squid These Are squid now males when they fight if they're really aggressive they turn white and these two males are fighting they do it by bouncing their butts together which is an interesting concept now here's a male on the left and a female on the right and now the male has managed to split his color coloration so the female only always sees the Kinder gentler squid in him and the M's on the we're going to see it again let's take a look at it again watch the coloration white on the right Brown on the left he takes a step back so he's keeping off the other males by splitting his body and he comes up on the other side Bingo now I'm told that's not just a squid phenomena with males but I I know that's cuttlefish I love cuttlefish this is a giant Australian cuttlefish and there he is his droopy little eyes up here but they could do pretty amazing things too here we're going to see one backing into uh crevice and and watch his watch his tentacles he just pulls them in makes them look just like algae disappears right into the background positively amazing here's two males fighting once again they're they're smart enough these seapods they know not to hurt each other but look at the patterns that they can do with their skin okay just an amazing thing here's an octopus sometimes they don't want to be seen when they move because Predators can see them and here this is this guy actually can make himself look like a rock and looking at this environment can actually slide across the bottom using the waves in the shadows so he can't be seen he does he Blends right into the his motion Blends right into the background the moving rock trick so we're learning Lots new from the shallow water still exploring that deep learning Lots from the shallow water there's a good reason why I mean the shallow water is full of predators here's a barracuda and if you're an octopus or a seapod you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide in the next scene you're going to see nice Coral bottom and you'd see that an octopus would stand out very easily there if you couldn't use your camouflage use your skin to change color and texture here's some LGA in the ground and an octopus isn't that amazing now Roger spooked him so it's he took off cloud of ink lands and when he lands the octopus says I've been seen best thing to do is get as big as I can get that big brown makes his eye spot very big so he's bluffing let's do it backwards I thought he was joking when he first showed it to me I thought it was all Graphics so here here it is in Reverse watch the skin color watch the skin texture just an amazing animal change color and texture to match the surroundings watch them blend right into this LG 1 2 [Applause] 3 and now he's gone and so am I thank you very much thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] we're going to go on a dive to the deep sea and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity knows that for the about two and a half hours on the way down it's a perfectly positively pitch black world and we used to see the most mysterious animals out there window that you couldn't describe these blinking lights a world of bioluminescence like fireflies Dr Edith Witter she's now at the ocean research and Conservation Association was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals and that's what you're seeing here on the screen that's all bioluminescence like I said just like fireflies there's a flying turkey under turkey I don't I yeah I I'm I'm a geologist by training uh but I love that uh and you see some of the some of the luminescence they used to avoid being eaten some they used to attract prey but all of it from an artistic point of view is just positively amazing and a lot of what goes on inside there's a fish with glowing eyes pulsating eyes some some of the colors are designed to hypnotize these lovely patterns and then this last one one of my favorites this pin wheel design just absolutely amazing every single dive that's the unknown world and today we've only explored about 3% 3% of what's out there in the ocean already we found the world's highest mountains world's deepest valleys underwater Lakes underwater waterfalls a lot of that we shared with you from the stage and in a place where we thought no life at all we find more life we think and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest which tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all there's still 97% and either that 97% is empty or just full of surprises but I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing the seapods head foots as a kid I knew them as calamari mostly but this is an octopus this is a work of Dr Roger hanin at the Marine biological lab and just fascinating how how seop pods can with their eyes incredible eyes sense their surrounding look at light look at patterns here's an octopus moving across the reef finds a spot to settle down curls up and then disappears into the background tough thing to do in the next bit we're going to see a couple of squid These Are squid now males when they fight if they're really aggressive they turn white and these two males are fighting they do it by bouncing their butts together which is an interesting concept now here's a male on the left and a female on the right and now the male has managed to split his color coloration so the female only always sees the Kinder gentler squid in him and the M's on the we're going to see it again let's take a look at it again watch the coloration white on the right Brown on the left he takes a step back so he's keeping off the other males by splitting his body and he comes up on the other side Bingo now I'm told that's not just a squid phenomena with males but I I know that's cuttlefish I love cuttlefish this is a giant Australian cuttlefish and there he is his droopy little eyes up here but they could do pretty amazing things too here we're going to see one backing into uh crevice and and watch his watch his tentacles he just pulls them in makes them look just like algae disappears right into the background positively amazing here's two males fighting once again they're they're smart enough these seapods they know not to hurt each other but look at the patterns that they can do with their skin okay just an amazing thing here's an octopus sometimes they don't want to be seen when they move because Predators can see them and here this is this guy actually can make himself look like a rock and looking at this environment can actually slide across the bottom using the waves in the shadows so he can't be seen he does he Blends right into the his motion Blends right into the background the moving rock trick so we're learning Lots new from the shallow water still exploring that deep learning Lots from the shallow water there's a good reason why I mean the shallow water is full of predators here's a barracuda and if you're an octopus or a seapod you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide in the next scene you're going to see nice Coral bottom and you'd see that an octopus would stand out very easily there if you couldn't use your camouflage use your skin to change color and texture here's some LGA in the ground and an octopus isn't that amazing now Roger spooked him so it's he took off cloud of ink lands and when he lands the octopus says I've been seen best thing to do is get as big as I can get that big brown makes his eye spot very big so he's bluffing let's do it backwards I thought he was joking when he first showed it to me I thought it was all Graphics so here here it is in Reverse watch the skin color watch the skin texture just an amazing animal change color and texture to match the surroundings watch them blend right into this LG 1 2 [Applause] 3 and now he's gone and so am I thank you very much thank you thank you

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Take a look outside a window. What is the season where you are? How do you know? Most likely, you looked at a tree or plant and noticed details about its leaves and assessed the qualities of sunlight streaming outside. Observing the timing of biological events in relation to changes in season and climate is called "phenology". When you notice the daffodil buds are poking through the snow and think spring is on its way, you're using phenology. When you see leaves turn from green to red, and watch migrating birds fly past, and realize that summer is over, autumn is here, you're using phenology. Literally meaning, "the science of appearance", phenology comes from the Greek words "pheno," to show or appear, and "logos," to study. Humans have relied on phenology since the time of hunters and gatherers. We've watched changes in seasons to know when to plant and harvest food and when to track migrating animals. Scientists observe and document seasonal changes in nature and look for patterns in the timing of seasonal events. Timing of these natural signs has remained consistent until recently. Increasing global temperature is causing rhythms of nature to shift. Bud burst, the day when a tree or plant's leaf or flower buds open, is occurring earlier in the year for some species. For every one degree Celsius rise in temperature, bud burst happens five days earlier than usual. Differences in timing affect not only plants, but the insects and birds that depend on the plants for food. For example, oak trees in the Arnhem Forest of the Netherlands now experience bud burst ten days earlier, as compared to twenty years ago. New oak leaves are a favorite food of winter moth caterpillars. To survive, the caterpillars adapted to the change in the tree's timing, and now hatch 15 days earlier than before. Migrating pied flycatcher birds, however, aren't doing as well. The birds prefer to feed their chicks winter moth caterpillars. The caterpillars are now hatching earlier, but the birds' chicks are not. This delay is costing the birds a food source. The pied flycatcher population has decreased by up to 90% in some areas as a result. Changes to a seemingly simple event, leaves opening, has ripple effects throughout a food web. Earlier bloom times can also have an economic impact. The famed cherry blossoms in Washington D.C. are blooming five days earlier than before. Since the cherry trees are blooming earlier, the blossoms also fade earlier, frustrating thousands of tourists who visit for the Cherry Blossom Festival. High school marching bands plan all year to attend the parade and perform, surrounded by a majestic white canopy. How disappointing for them to find, well, trees rather than the famous cherry blossoms! Plants and animals react to changes in natural light and temperature. Increasing temperatures cause plants to bloom earlier than before, and become out of sync with the insects and birds in a food web. So, the next time you look out your window and notice what season it is, you may be fooled by those blooming trees. Think of phenology, then think of how you can play a part to slow climate change.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Take a look outside a window. What is the season where you are? How do you know? Most likely, you looked at a tree or plant and noticed details about its leaves and assessed the qualities of sunlight streaming outside. Observing the timing of biological events in relation to changes in season and climate is called "phenology". When you notice the daffodil buds are poking through the snow and think spring is on its way, you're using phenology. When you see leaves turn from green to red, and watch migrating birds fly past, and realize that summer is over, autumn is here, you're using phenology. Literally meaning, "the science of appearance", phenology comes from the Greek words "pheno," to show or appear, and "logos," to study. Humans have relied on phenology since the time of hunters and gatherers. We've watched changes in seasons to know when to plant and harvest food and when to track migrating animals. Scientists observe and document seasonal changes in nature and look for patterns in the timing of seasonal events. Timing of these natural signs has remained consistent until recently. Increasing global temperature is causing rhythms of nature to shift. Bud burst, the day when a tree or plant's leaf or flower buds open, is occurring earlier in the year for some species. For every one degree Celsius rise in temperature, bud burst happens five days earlier than usual. Differences in timing affect not only plants, but the insects and birds that depend on the plants for food. For example, oak trees in the Arnhem Forest of the Netherlands now experience bud burst ten days earlier, as compared to twenty years ago. New oak leaves are a favorite food of winter moth caterpillars. To survive, the caterpillars adapted to the change in the tree's timing, and now hatch 15 days earlier than before. Migrating pied flycatcher birds, however, aren't doing as well. The birds prefer to feed their chicks winter moth caterpillars. The caterpillars are now hatching earlier, but the birds' chicks are not. This delay is costing the birds a food source. The pied flycatcher population has decreased by up to 90% in some areas as a result. Changes to a seemingly simple event, leaves opening, has ripple effects throughout a food web. Earlier bloom times can also have an economic impact. The famed cherry blossoms in Washington D.C. are blooming five days earlier than before. Since the cherry trees are blooming earlier, the blossoms also fade earlier, frustrating thousands of tourists who visit for the Cherry Blossom Festival. High school marching bands plan all year to attend the parade and perform, surrounded by a majestic white canopy. How disappointing for them to find, well, trees rather than the famous cherry blossoms! Plants and animals react to changes in natural light and temperature. Increasing temperatures cause plants to bloom earlier than before, and become out of sync with the insects and birds in a food web. So, the next time you look out your window and notice what season it is, you may be fooled by those blooming trees. Think of phenology, then think of how you can play a part to slow climate change.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Right now, trillions of chemical reactions are humming away in the cells of your body. You never feel them, but without these reactions, you wouldn't be alive. Unfortunately, each of those reactions needs some help. You see, most molecules are stable, they are happy just the way they are. The atoms in them are all bound-up and friendly with one another and would prefer to stay that way. The problem is, for a chemical reaction to happen, the atoms that make up those stable molecules need to break away from their friends and go buddy up with another atom. This break-up is where the molecules need a hand. This initial kick-start is known as activation energy. It's used to destabilize the molecule, to push the bonds between the atoms to a place where they are ready to break. This unstable state is known as the molecule's transition state. Once a transition state has been achieved, the atoms become willing to leave their current molecular friends and go make new friends elsewhere. Once they are convinced, it's a piece of cake. Bonds break, atoms rearrange, and the rest of the reaction happens automatically. After that first push, the body doesn't need to put in any more energy to help the reaction along. Left alone, most of these reactions would be very slow because it takes quite a while to build up the activation energy the molecules need to get started. Enter the enzyme. Enzymes are proteins that speed up, or catalyze, reactions by lowering the activation energy. They make it easier for the molecule, also known as a substrate, to get to the transition state. You can think of a reaction like a race. Some racers are running along, while others have teammates to help them. Meet Sam the Substrate. His team is the MODS Squad. Together, his team is able to get to the finish faster, using less energy. There are four special enzymes in Sam's team. Each has a different strategy for lowering the energy it takes to get going and speeding up the pace to get the MODS to the finish line. The "M" stands for "microenvironment". This enzyme creates a tiny, special environment for the substrate, resulting in a faster reaction time. He runs ahead of the pack, flattening out bumps in the road and misting cool water on his team of molecules. "O" is for "orientation". Sometimes two molecules must be positioned just right before they will react. Like a friend at the finish line, the O enzyme provides his molecules with specially shaped spaces that allow the substrates to interact in just the right way. "D" stands for "direct participation". Every now and again, a little muscle is needed. And when his teammates are struggling to finish the race, Teammate D is there to pick them up and carry them over the line. Finally, "S" is for "straining bonds". This guy pushes the team through some serious flexibility exercises: splits, lunges, backbends, the works. Sometimes his substrate teammates just need to be stressed and flexed into their transition state. So that's it. Remember that all reactions need energy to get going. This energy is known as the activation energy. Enzymes lower that activation energy and speed the reaction through team MODS: microenvironment, orientation, direct participation, and straining bonds.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the behavior of atoms in a chemical reaction, specifically what they do. The correct answer is that they combine with new atoms.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 is the most related to the ground truth MCQ, as it discusses the transition state of molecules, which involves the breaking and forming of bonds between atoms. However, it does not directly ask about the behavior of atoms in a chemical reaction.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the behavior of molecules or atoms in a chemical reaction, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Given the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 8 is the most related, but it's still not a good match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 8 (although it's not a good match)

This energy is known as the activation energy. Enzymes lower that activation energy and speed the reaction through team MODS: microenvironment, orientation, direct participation, and straining bonds.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Right now, trillions of chemical reactions are humming away in the cells of your body. You never feel them, but without these reactions, you wouldn't be alive. Unfortunately, each of those reactions needs some help. You see, most molecules are stable, they are happy just the way they are. The atoms in them are all bound-up and friendly with one another and would prefer to stay that way. The problem is, for a chemical reaction to happen, the atoms that make up those stable molecules need to break away from their friends and go buddy up with another atom. This break-up is where the molecules need a hand. This initial kick-start is known as activation energy. It's used to destabilize the molecule, to push the bonds between the atoms to a place where they are ready to break. This unstable state is known as the molecule's transition state. Once a transition state has been achieved, the atoms become willing to leave their current molecular friends and go make new friends elsewhere. Once they are convinced, it's a piece of cake. Bonds break, atoms rearrange, and the rest of the reaction happens automatically. After that first push, the body doesn't need to put in any more energy to help the reaction along. Left alone, most of these reactions would be very slow because it takes quite a while to build up the activation energy the molecules need to get started. Enter the enzyme. Enzymes are proteins that speed up, or catalyze, reactions by lowering the activation energy. They make it easier for the molecule, also known as a substrate, to get to the transition state. You can think of a reaction like a race. Some racers are running along, while others have teammates to help them. Meet Sam the Substrate. His team is the MODS Squad. Together, his team is able to get to the finish faster, using less energy. There are four special enzymes in Sam's team. Each has a different strategy for lowering the energy it takes to get going and speeding up the pace to get the MODS to the finish line. The "M" stands for "microenvironment". This enzyme creates a tiny, special environment for the substrate, resulting in a faster reaction time. He runs ahead of the pack, flattening out bumps in the road and misting cool water on his team of molecules. "O" is for "orientation". Sometimes two molecules must be positioned just right before they will react. Like a friend at the finish line, the O enzyme provides his molecules with specially shaped spaces that allow the substrates to interact in just the right way. "D" stands for "direct participation". Every now and again, a little muscle is needed. And when his teammates are struggling to finish the race, Teammate D is there to pick them up and carry them over the line. Finally, "S" is for "straining bonds". This guy pushes the team through some serious flexibility exercises: splits, lunges, backbends, the works. Sometimes his substrate teammates just need to be stressed and flexed into their transition state. So that's it. Remember that all reactions need energy to get going.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the closest match.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the specific role of one of the MODS (Microenvironment, Orientation, Direct Participation, and Straining Bonds) in enzyme function. The correct answer is Orientation, which is described as providing "specially shaped spaces that allow the substrates to interact in just the right way."

Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the closest match in terms of content and intent. It asks about the MODS Squad analogy and how it can be used to understand enzyme function. However, the options are not directly related to the specific roles of each MODS member.

Since there isn't a direct match, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is closest in terms of content and intent:

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You might have heard that light is a kind of wave and that the color of an object is related to the frequency of light waves it reflects. High-frequency light waves look violet, low-frequency light waves look red, and in-between frequencies look yellow, green, orange, and so on. You might call this idea physical color because it says that color is a physical property of light itself. It's not dependent on human perception. And, while this isn't wrong, it isn't quite the whole story either. For instance, you might have seen this picture before. As you can see, the region where the red and green lights overlap is yellow. When you think about it, this is pretty weird. Because light is a wave, two different frequencies shouldn't interact with each other at all, they should just co-exist like singers singing in harmony. So, in this yellow looking region, two different kinds of light waves are present: one with a red frequency, and one with a green frequency. There is no yellow light present at all. So, how come this region, where the red and green lights mix, looks yellow to us? To understand this, you have to understand a little bit about biology, in particular, about how humans see color. Light perception happens in a paper-thin layer of cells, called the retina, that covers the back of your eyeball. In the retina, there are two different types of light-detecting cells: rods and cones. The rods are used for seeing in low-light conditions, and there is only one kind of those. The cones, however, are a different story. There three kinds of cone cells that roughly correspond to the colors red, green, and blue. When you see a color, each cone sends its own distinct signal to your brain. For example, suppose that yellow light, that is real yellow light, with a yellow frequency, is shining on your eye. You don't have a cone specifically for detecting yellow, but yellow is kind of close to green and also kind of close to red, so both the red and green cones get activated, and each sends a signal to your brain saying so. Of course, there is another way to activate the red cones and the green cones simultaneously: if both red light and green light are present at the same time. The point is, your brain receives the same signal, regardless of whether you see light that has the yellow frequency or light that is a mixture of the green and red frequencies. That's why, for light, red plus green equals yellow. And, how come you can't detect colors when it's dark? Well, the rod cells in your retina take over in low-light conditions. You only have one kind of rod cell, and so there is one type of signal that can get sent to your brain: light or no light. Having only one kind of light detector doesn't leave any room for seeing color. There are infinitely many different physical colors, but, because we only have three kinds of cones, the brain can be tricked into thinking it's seeing any color by carefully adding together the right combination of just three colors: red, green, and blue. This property of human vision is really useful in the real world. For example, TV manufacturing. Instead of having to put infinitely many colors in your TV set to simulate the real world, TV manufacturers only have to put three: red, green, and blue, which is lucky for them, really.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although Question 7 does not directly ask why it is weird that green and red light mix to form yellow light, it does address the relationship between light frequency and color, and how different frequencies interact with each other. This concept is central to the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more suitable match would be a question that directly addresses the concept of why it is weird that green and red light mix to form yellow light. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question.

That being said, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the provided options, I would choose Question 7, as it is the closest match in terms of content and intent.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You might have heard that light is a kind of wave and that the color of an object is related to the frequency of light waves it reflects. High-frequency light waves look violet, low-frequency light waves look red, and in-between frequencies look yellow, green, orange, and so on. You might call this idea physical color because it says that color is a physical property of light itself. It's not dependent on human perception. And, while this isn't wrong, it isn't quite the whole story either. For instance, you might have seen this picture before. As you can see, the region where the red and green lights overlap is yellow. When you think about it, this is pretty weird. Because light is a wave, two different frequencies shouldn't interact with each other at all, they should just co-exist like singers singing in harmony. So, in this yellow looking region, two different kinds of light waves are present: one with a red frequency, and one with a green frequency. There is no yellow light present at all. So, how come this region, where the red and green lights mix, looks yellow to us? To understand this, you have to understand a little bit about biology, in particular, about how humans see color. Light perception happens in a paper-thin layer of cells, called the retina, that covers the back of your eyeball. In the retina, there are two different types of light-detecting cells: rods and cones. The rods are used for seeing in low-light conditions, and there is only one kind of those. The cones, however, are a different story. There three kinds of cone cells that roughly correspond to the colors red, green, and blue. When you see a color, each cone sends its own distinct signal to your brain. For example, suppose that yellow light, that is real yellow light, with a yellow frequency, is shining on your eye. You don't have a cone specifically for detecting yellow, but yellow is kind of close to green and also kind of close to red, so both the red and green cones get activated, and each sends a signal to your brain saying so. Of course, there is another way to activate the red cones and the green cones simultaneously: if both red light and green light are present at the same time. The point is, your brain receives the same signal, regardless of whether you see light that has the yellow frequency or light that is a mixture of the green and red frequencies. That's why, for light, red plus green equals yellow. And, how come you can't detect colors when it's dark? Well, the rod cells in your retina take over in low-light conditions. You only have one kind of rod cell, and so there is one type of signal that can get sent to your brain: light or no light. Having only one kind of light detector doesn't leave any room for seeing color. There are infinitely many different physical colors, but, because we only have three kinds of cones, the brain can be tricked into thinking it's seeing any color by carefully adding together the right combination of just three colors: red, green, and blue. This property of human vision is really useful in the real world. For example, TV manufacturing. Instead of having to put infinitely many colors in your TV set to simulate the real world, TV manufacturers only have to put three: red, green, and blue, which is lucky for them, really.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest some possible reasons why:

1. The ground truth MCQ asks about a specific type of cell that is not a light-detecting cell, whereas the generated MCQs focus on light frequency, color perception, and TV manufacturing.
2. The options in the ground truth MCQ include "Pigmas" which is not mentioned in the transcript or any of the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 4, which asks about how the brain perceives color according to our understanding of human vision. However, this question is still quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would not recommend any of the generated MCQs as a match for the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You might have heard that light is a kind of wave and that the color of an object is related to the frequency of light waves it reflects. High-frequency light waves look violet, low-frequency light waves look red, and in-between frequencies look yellow, green, orange, and so on. You might call this idea physical color because it says that color is a physical property of light itself. It's not dependent on human perception. And, while this isn't wrong, it isn't quite the whole story either. For instance, you might have seen this picture before. As you can see, the region where the red and green lights overlap is yellow. When you think about it, this is pretty weird. Because light is a wave, two different frequencies shouldn't interact with each other at all, they should just co-exist like singers singing in harmony. So, in this yellow looking region, two different kinds of light waves are present: one with a red frequency, and one with a green frequency. There is no yellow light present at all. So, how come this region, where the red and green lights mix, looks yellow to us? To understand this, you have to understand a little bit about biology, in particular, about how humans see color. Light perception happens in a paper-thin layer of cells, called the retina, that covers the back of your eyeball. In the retina, there are two different types of light-detecting cells: rods and cones. The rods are used for seeing in low-light conditions, and there is only one kind of those. The cones, however, are a different story. There three kinds of cone cells that roughly correspond to the colors red, green, and blue. When you see a color, each cone sends its own distinct signal to your brain. For example, suppose that yellow light, that is real yellow light, with a yellow frequency, is shining on your eye. You don't have a cone specifically for detecting yellow, but yellow is kind of close to green and also kind of close to red, so both the red and green cones get activated, and each sends a signal to your brain saying so. Of course, there is another way to activate the red cones and the green cones simultaneously: if both red light and green light are present at the same time. The point is, your brain receives the same signal, regardless of whether you see light that has the yellow frequency or light that is a mixture of the green and red frequencies. That's why, for light, red plus green equals yellow. And, how come you can't detect colors when it's dark? Well, the rod cells in your retina take over in low-light conditions. You only have one kind of rod cell, and so there is one type of signal that can get sent to your brain: light or no light. Having only one kind of light detector doesn't leave any room for seeing color. There are infinitely many different physical colors, but, because we only have three kinds of cones, the brain can be tricked into thinking it's seeing any color by carefully adding together the right combination of just three colors: red, green, and blue. This property of human vision is really useful in the real world. For example, TV manufacturing. Instead of having to put infinitely many colors in your TV set to simulate the real world, TV manufacturers only have to put three: red, green, and blue, which is lucky for them, really.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Being human, we each view ourselves as a unique and independent individual, but we're never alone! Millions of microscopic beings inhabit our bodies, and no two bodies are the same. Each is a different habitat for microbial communities: from the arid deserts of our skin, to the villages on our lips, and the cities in our mouths. Even every tooth is its own distinctive neighborhood, and our guts are teaming metropolises of interacting microbes. And in these bustling streets of our guts, we see a constant influx of food, and every microbe has a job to do. Here's a cellulolytic bacteria, for example. Their one job is to break down cellulose, a common compound in vegetables, into sugars. Those simple sugars then move along to the respirators, another set of microbes that snatch up these simple sugars and burn them as fuel. As food travels through our digestive tract, it reaches the fermentors who extract energy from these sugars by converting them into chemicals, like alcohol and hydrogen gas, which they spew out as waste products. Deeper in the depths of our gut city, the syntrophs eke out a living off the fermenters' trash. At each step of this process, energy is released, and that energy is absorbed by the cells of the digestive tract. This city we just saw is different in everyone. Every person has a unique and diverse community of gut microbes that can process food in different ways. One person's gut microbes may be capable of releasing only a fraction of the calories that another person's gut microbes can extract. So, what determines the membership of our gut microbial community? Well, things like our genetic makeup and the microbes we encounter throughout our lives can contribute to our microbial ecosystems. The food we eat also influences which microbes live in our gut. For example, food made of complex molecules, like an apple, requires a lot of different microbial workers to break it down. But, if a food is made of simple molecules, like a lollipop, some of these workers are put out of a job. Those workers leave the city, never to return. What doesn't function well are gut microbial communities with only a few different types of workers. For example, humans who suffer from diseases like diabetes or chronic gut inflamation typically have less microbial variety in their guts. We don't fully understand the best way to manage our individual microbial societies, but it is likely that lifestyle changes, such as eating a varied diet of complex, plant-based foods, can help revitalize our microbial ecosystems in our gut and across the entire landscape of our body. So, we are really not alone in our body. Our bodies are homes to millions of different microbes, and we need them just as much as they need us. As we learn more about how our microbes interact with each other and with our bodies, we will reveal how we can nurture this complex, invisible world that shapes our personal identity, our health, and our well-being.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

However, I can suggest some generated MCQs that are related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is about the number of microscopic beings inhabiting our bodies.

One possible match is Question 3: "What is the primary function of the gut microbial community in the human body?" While this question does not directly ask about the number of microscopic beings, it does relate to the topic of gut microbes and their role in the human body.

Another possible match is Question 8: "What can be inferred from the contrast between a diverse, healthy gut microbial community and an imbalanced one?" This question also relates to the topic of gut microbes, but it does not directly address the number of microscopic beings.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but it's still not a direct match.

**Question 3: What is the primary function of the gut microbial community in the human body? Options: A. To regulate body temperature, B. To process food and release energy, C. To maintain skin health, D. To support immune function Correct Option: B**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that specifically asks about the role of fermenters in the gut microbial community.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one based on the content and intent, I would choose:

**Question 1: What type of bacteria is responsible for breaking down cellulose into simple sugars in the gut? Options: A. Fermentors, B. Respirators, C. Cellulolytic bacteria, D. Syntrophs Correct Option: C**

This question is related to the process of breaking down food in the gut, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, it does not specifically ask about the role of fermenters.

If I had to provide an index, I would say:

**Index: 1 (with the caveat that it's not an exact match)**

Please note that it would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that specifically asks about the role of fermenters in the gut microbial community, such as:

**Question: What do fermenters do as food travels through our digestive tract? Options: A. Create proteins by fermenting carbohydrates, B. Extract energy from sugars by converting them to chemicals, C. Catalyze digestion by fermenting waste, D. All of the above Correct Option: B**

This question would be a more exact match to the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Being human, we each view ourselves as a unique and independent individual, but we're never alone! Millions of microscopic beings inhabit our bodies, and no two bodies are the same. Each is a different habitat for microbial communities: from the arid deserts of our skin, to the villages on our lips, and the cities in our mouths. Even every tooth is its own distinctive neighborhood, and our guts are teaming metropolises of interacting microbes. And in these bustling streets of our guts, we see a constant influx of food, and every microbe has a job to do. Here's a cellulolytic bacteria, for example. Their one job is to break down cellulose, a common compound in vegetables, into sugars. Those simple sugars then move along to the respirators, another set of microbes that snatch up these simple sugars and burn them as fuel. As food travels through our digestive tract, it reaches the fermentors who extract energy from these sugars by converting them into chemicals, like alcohol and hydrogen gas, which they spew out as waste products. Deeper in the depths of our gut city, the syntrophs eke out a living off the fermenters' trash. At each step of this process, energy is released, and that energy is absorbed by the cells of the digestive tract. This city we just saw is different in everyone. Every person has a unique and diverse community of gut microbes that can process food in different ways. One person's gut microbes may be capable of releasing only a fraction of the calories that another person's gut microbes can extract. So, what determines the membership of our gut microbial community? Well, things like our genetic makeup and the microbes we encounter throughout our lives can contribute to our microbial ecosystems. The food we eat also influences which microbes live in our gut. For example, food made of complex molecules, like an apple, requires a lot of different microbial workers to break it down. But, if a food is made of simple molecules, like a lollipop, some of these workers are put out of a job. Those workers leave the city, never to return. What doesn't function well are gut microbial communities with only a few different types of workers. For example, humans who suffer from diseases like diabetes or chronic gut inflamation typically have less microbial variety in their guts. We don't fully understand the best way to manage our individual microbial societies, but it is likely that lifestyle changes, such as eating a varied diet of complex, plant-based foods, can help revitalize our microbial ecosystems in our gut and across the entire landscape of our body. So, we are really not alone in our body. Our bodies are homes to millions of different microbes, and we need them just as much as they need us. As we learn more about how our microbes interact with each other and with our bodies, we will reveal how we can nurture this complex, invisible world that shapes our personal identity, our health, and our well-being.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is focused on the idea that different people's gut microbes can release varying amounts of calories from the same food. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 3 is the most similar in terms of content and intent.

Question 3 asks about the primary function of the gut microbial community, which is related to processing food and releasing energy. This is closely related to the idea that different people's gut microbes can release varying amounts of calories.

However, an even more relevant question is Question 2, which discusses the characteristics of gut microbial communities in individuals with certain diseases, and Question 5, which asks about how understanding gut microbes can inform dietary choices. But neither of these questions directly addresses the idea of varying calorie release.

But then, looking at the rest of the questions, Question 7, 8, and 12 have some relevance, with Question 7 and 8, discussing the relationship between gut microbes and human health, and Question 12, about the importance of considering gut microbes in personalized medicine.

Among all these, Question 3 is still the most similar, but not a perfect match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The brain is the center of all of our thoughts, dreams, emotions, and memories. It's what makes us who we are. But, there is still a lot that we don't know about the brain. Scientists have worked for years on trying to understand the human brain using techniques like EEG and FMRI, where we scan the brain from the outside. But what if we could look inside the brains of humans and watch them as they work? Well, now we can by looking at the brains of people who are already going through surgery for clinical reasons, like curing epilepsy. Epilepsy is a disease in which a faulty part of the brain starts working spontaneously for no apparent reason. It's like an earthquake but inside your head. There's no way to know in advance when a seizure will occur, so the patients are always at risk of unexpectedly losing control. There are drugs that treat epilepsy, but these don't always work. Some patients who don't respond well to the drugs can undergo a different treatment where the faulty part in their brain, the part that starts the seizures, is surgically removed. The challenge is knowing which part to take out. How do you figure out which bit of the brain is faulty? In order to find the exact location of the seizure onset, doctors embed electrodes directly into the patient's brain around the suspected seizure center. The patient then stays in the hospital for a few days, waiting to have a seizure with the electrodes constantly recording the activity inside his or her brain. Yes, now we want the patient to have a seizure so doctors can use the embedded electrodes to measure it and learn exactly where its origin was. After doctors are sure where the seizures come from in the brain, they can take the electrodes out. Now they know what part of the brain they can remove in order to cure the patient. These brain electrodes can tell us more than just where the seizures happen. Based on where the doctors place the electrodes in the brain, we can ask questions about what the brain does. Sometimes we find one cell that starts bursting in activity every time the patient sees a particular picture, for example, a picture of Marilyn Monroe. See, every time the patient sees Marilyn Monroe, some specific cells fire in the brain. You can now know when the patient is thinking of Marilyn Monroe just by listening to these cells fire. When we find one or a few of these cells with each patient, we can then do all kinds of fancy things. For example, we can connect the recording electrode to a cursor on a screen and have the patient move the cursor left or right just by thinking of things. This can help people who lost the ability to move their hands, like people with spinal cord injuries or wounded soldiers, by having them control a prosthetic arm directly with their brain. Our brain is a brilliant device which can make predictions about the future. For example, we can all know which word will appear at the end of this... sentence. The brain can solve complicated problems, imagine the entire universe, and grasp concepts such as infinity or unicorns. The brain produces complex emotions like love or jealousy, it's what makes us creative and curious, and it can even contemplate about itself. And the brain is the organ we use to study the brain. I think that the brain is the most beautiful organ in our body, but then I ask myself, "Which organ is making me think that?"

See, every time the patient sees Marilyn Monroe, some specific cells fire in the brain. You can now know when the patient is thinking of Marilyn Monroe just by listening to these cells fire. When we find one or a few of these cells with each patient, we can then do all kinds of fancy things. For example, we can connect the recording electrode to a cursor on a screen and have the patient move the cursor left or right just by thinking of things. This can help people who lost the ability to move their hands, like people with spinal cord injuries or wounded soldiers, by having them control a prosthetic arm directly with their brain. Our brain is a brilliant device which can make predictions about the future. For example, we can all know which word will appear at the end of this... sentence. The brain can solve complicated problems, imagine the entire universe, and grasp concepts such as infinity or unicorns. The brain produces complex emotions like love or jealousy, it's what makes us creative and curious, and it can even contemplate about itself. And the brain is the organ we use to study the brain. I think that the brain is the most beautiful organ in our body, but then I ask myself, "Which organ is making me think that?"

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The brain is the center of all of our thoughts, dreams, emotions, and memories. It's what makes us who we are. But, there is still a lot that we don't know about the brain. Scientists have worked for years on trying to understand the human brain using techniques like EEG and FMRI, where we scan the brain from the outside. But what if we could look inside the brains of humans and watch them as they work? Well, now we can by looking at the brains of people who are already going through surgery for clinical reasons, like curing epilepsy. Epilepsy is a disease in which a faulty part of the brain starts working spontaneously for no apparent reason. It's like an earthquake but inside your head. There's no way to know in advance when a seizure will occur, so the patients are always at risk of unexpectedly losing control. There are drugs that treat epilepsy, but these don't always work. Some patients who don't respond well to the drugs can undergo a different treatment where the faulty part in their brain, the part that starts the seizures, is surgically removed. The challenge is knowing which part to take out. How do you figure out which bit of the brain is faulty? In order to find the exact location of the seizure onset, doctors embed electrodes directly into the patient's brain around the suspected seizure center. The patient then stays in the hospital for a few days, waiting to have a seizure with the electrodes constantly recording the activity inside his or her brain. Yes, now we want the patient to have a seizure so doctors can use the embedded electrodes to measure it and learn exactly where its origin was. After doctors are sure where the seizures come from in the brain, they can take the electrodes out. Now they know what part of the brain they can remove in order to cure the patient. These brain electrodes can tell us more than just where the seizures happen. Based on where the doctors place the electrodes in the brain, we can ask questions about what the brain does.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Normally astronaut training takes about one full year, and it includes such subjects as astronomy, astrophysics, flight physiology, orbital trajectories, or orbital management. Another part of the astronaut basic training is survival training. In the days of Gemini, you never knew for sure where a spacecraft might land if there was an emergency, deorbit. So, we had to take desert training, water training, and jungle survival training. So, we had to learn how to cook and eat snake and all other, such other good things as that, and how to make water in a desert. After that year and a half of astronaut basic training, our names were all put on a list and that list was quite a bit longer at that time then there were seats available. And so, we were all given other duties to keep us occupied and to help continue our training. Five of us were assigned to the lunar module, and our job was to be with these lunar modules as they were being built. So, we spent a lot of time there. I must admit that probably I had more time sleeping on the floor of Lunar Module #6 than the crew who flew it on the moon. Well, my next job was to be on the support crew of Apollo 8, and Apollo 8 was the spacecraft that flew to the moon and came back but did not land. When they went behind the moon, they were supposed to do a thrusting maneuver to slow them down so they would be captured into lunar orbit. So we just had to sit and cool our heels when they went behind the moon, and we knew if they came out a little early on the other side, that they had not burned enough, not slowed down enough, and were going to skip out into space, they wouldn't be captured in orbit. If they came out a little bit late, it meant they had over-done it, and they weren't going to be in orbit, but were going to begin a spiral down to the lunar surface. And, of course, without a lunar module, that kind of ruins your whole day. You can imagine how relieved we were at the instant that they were supposed to appear on the other side of the moon that they appeared! My next assignment was again a support crew assignment on Apollo 12, and Apollo 12 was struck by lightning on its way off the pad. A nearby thunderstorm, there was a lightning bolt that went over and hit the very tip of the spacecraft. The charge went down through the spacecraft, through the booster, down the exhaust gases, and grounded out on the launching pad. It killed the electrical power system and the computers all died. You can imagine what it must have been like for them inside because suddenly the lights all went out and then they came back on when the batteries picked up the load. And, every single warning light and caution light in the spacecraft was on and flashing, and all the necessary bells, whistles, and buzzards and things that are in there, all were going off at the same time. The crew was totally confused as to what was going on. When we were settled in orbit, we tested all the various systems and everything looked good. So, that, now I figured this is it, and sure enough, I did get an assignment, a flight assignment. I was assigned to the back-up crew of Apollo 16, which meant that I was to be on the param crew of Apollo 19. And, several weeks into the training, NASA made the surprise announcment that they were going to cancel Apollos 18, 19, and 20. We were in the middle of the Vietnam War, the budget was in bad shape, so you can imagine there were three very, very sad hangdog guys moping around the office because we lost our flight to the moon. But, several weeks later, I got a call from Tom Stafford, the Senior Astronaut at that time, and he wanted me in his office, and I went in, and he told me that he was sorry that I had missed my opportunity for the moon, but he said, "I've got another assignment for you." He said, "I want you to be the commander of the third and final Skylab mission." And, he said, "Do you think you could do the job?" And I said, "Of course, yes!" And, I'll have to admit, a certain lump in my chest and in my stomach, because I was a rookie, and they normally don't assign a rookie to be a commander, usually you have to have at least one flight under your belt, but they assigned me to that, which was really kind of a shock because the last rookie commander was Neil Armstrong on Gemini 8.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Normally astronaut training takes about one full year, and it includes such subjects as astronomy, astrophysics, flight physiology, orbital trajectories, or orbital management. Another part of the astronaut basic training is survival training. In the days of Gemini, you never knew for sure where a spacecraft might land if there was an emergency, deorbit. So, we had to take desert training, water training, and jungle survival training. So, we had to learn how to cook and eat snake and all other, such other good things as that, and how to make water in a desert. After that year and a half of astronaut basic training, our names were all put on a list and that list was quite a bit longer at that time then there were seats available. And so, we were all given other duties to keep us occupied and to help continue our training. Five of us were assigned to the lunar module, and our job was to be with these lunar modules as they were being built. So, we spent a lot of time there. I must admit that probably I had more time sleeping on the floor of Lunar Module #6 than the crew who flew it on the moon. Well, my next job was to be on the support crew of Apollo 8, and Apollo 8 was the spacecraft that flew to the moon and came back but did not land. When they went behind the moon, they were supposed to do a thrusting maneuver to slow them down so they would be captured into lunar orbit. So we just had to sit and cool our heels when they went behind the moon, and we knew if they came out a little early on the other side, that they had not burned enough, not slowed down enough, and were going to skip out into space, they wouldn't be captured in orbit. If they came out a little bit late, it meant they had over-done it, and they weren't going to be in orbit, but were going to begin a spiral down to the lunar surface. And, of course, without a lunar module, that kind of ruins your whole day. You can imagine how relieved we were at the instant that they were supposed to appear on the other side of the moon that they appeared! My next assignment was again a support crew assignment on Apollo 12, and Apollo 12 was struck by lightning on its way off the pad. A nearby thunderstorm, there was a lightning bolt that went over and hit the very tip of the spacecraft. The charge went down through the spacecraft, through the booster, down the exhaust gases, and grounded out on the launching pad. It killed the electrical power system and the computers all died. You can imagine what it must have been like for them inside because suddenly the lights all went out and then they came back on when the batteries picked up the load. And, every single warning light and caution light in the spacecraft was on and flashing, and all the necessary bells, whistles, and buzzards and things that are in there, all were going off at the same time. The crew was totally confused as to what was going on. When we were settled in orbit, we tested all the various systems and everything looked good. So, that, now I figured this is it, and sure enough, I did get an assignment, a flight assignment. I was assigned to the back-up crew of Apollo 16, which meant that I was to be on the param crew of Apollo 19. And, several weeks into the training, NASA made the surprise announcment that they were going to cancel Apollos 18, 19, and 20. We were in the middle of the Vietnam War, the budget was in bad shape, so you can imagine there were three very, very sad hangdog guys moping around the office because we lost our flight to the moon. But, several weeks later, I got a call from Tom Stafford, the Senior Astronaut at that time, and he wanted me in his office, and I went in, and he told me that he was sorry that I had missed my opportunity for the moon, but he said, "I've got another assignment for you." He said, "I want you to be the commander of the third and final Skylab mission." And, he said, "Do you think you could do the job?" And I said, "Of course, yes!" And, I'll have to admit, a certain lump in my chest and in my stomach, because I was a rookie, and they normally don't assign a rookie to be a commander, usually you have to have at least one flight under your belt, but they assigned me to that, which was really kind of a shock because the last rookie commander was Neil Armstrong on Gemini 8.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What do horror movies and comedies have in common? The two genres might seem totally different, but the reason they're both so popular is perhaps because what they have in common: their use of dramatic irony. First, let's clarify. There are three types of irony out there. Situational irony is when you expect one thing, but get the opposite. Verbal irony is when someone says something, but truly means the opposite. Dramatic irony, though, is what we will be looking at right now. Dramatic irony is when the audience seems to know more about an event, a situation, or a conversation than the characters in the movie, on the show, or in the book do. The audience is in on a secret that the characters have missed. This is a great story-telling device that creates tremendous emotion within that text. Think about it for a moment. How does it feel when, in a horror film, you know that the scary villain is hiding behind that door in the darkened room. The music becomes eerie, the lighting creates complete shadows, this has to be bad for the hero! Of course, though, that hero must enter the room to find the villain. You feel tremendous tension and the suspense of knowing that someone will jump out and be scary, but you just don't know when. That tension is dramatic irony: you know something more than the characters in the film. Now, take the typical comedy. There will probably be some type of "misunderstanding". Again, we know more of what is going on than the characters do. Picture two characters making a plan for a birthday surprise for their roommate while that roommate overhears the entire conversation from the hallway. From there, confusion and misunderstanding occur, and the tension builds. This isn't the same tension as the horror film since it is probably pretty funny as the character tries to figure out the whos and the whats, but it serves as a great example of the tension and suspense of dramatic irony. This tension or suspense in both genres drives the story and keeps the plot progressing. The audience wants, no, needs, to see the tension of the dramatic irony broken either by the scary person jumping out of the shadows or by someone finally revealing someone's true identity and clearing up the confusion. So, when you feel like you are in on a secret, that is dramatic irony, a hallmark of all the great writers, from Shakespeare to Hitchcock.

Dramatic irony is when the audience seems to know more about an event, a situation, or a conversation than the characters in the movie, on the show, or in the book do. The audience is in on a secret that the characters have missed. This is a great story-telling device that creates tremendous emotion within that text. Think about it for a moment. How does it feel when, in a horror film, you know that the scary villain is hiding behind that door in the darkened room. The music becomes eerie, the lighting creates complete shadows, this has to be bad for the hero! Of course, though, that hero must enter the room to find the villain. You feel tremendous tension and the suspense of knowing that someone will jump out and be scary, but you just don't know when. That tension is dramatic irony: you know something more than the characters in the film. Now, take the typical comedy. There will probably be some type of "misunderstanding". Again, we know more of what is going on than the characters do. Picture two characters making a plan for a birthday surprise for their roommate while that roommate overhears the entire conversation from the hallway. From there, confusion and misunderstanding occur, and the tension builds. This isn't the same tension as the horror film since it is probably pretty funny as the character tries to figure out the whos and the whats, but it serves as a great example of the tension and suspense of dramatic irony. This tension or suspense in both genres drives the story and keeps the plot progressing. The audience wants, no, needs, to see the tension of the dramatic irony broken either by the scary person jumping out of the shadows or by someone finally revealing someone's true identity and clearing up the confusion. So, when you feel like you are in on a secret, that is dramatic irony, a hallmark of all the great writers, from Shakespeare to Hitchcock.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What do horror movies and comedies have in common? The two genres might seem totally different, but the reason they're both so popular is perhaps because what they have in common: their use of dramatic irony. First, let's clarify. There are three types of irony out there. Situational irony is when you expect one thing, but get the opposite. Verbal irony is when someone says something, but truly means the opposite. Dramatic irony, though, is what we will be looking at right now. Dramatic irony is when the audience seems to know more about an event, a situation, or a conversation than the characters in the movie, on the show, or in the book do. The audience is in on a secret that the characters have missed. This is a great story-telling device that creates tremendous emotion within that text. Think about it for a moment. How does it feel when, in a horror film, you know that the scary villain is hiding behind that door in the darkened room. The music becomes eerie, the lighting creates complete shadows, this has to be bad for the hero! Of course, though, that hero must enter the room to find the villain. You feel tremendous tension and the suspense of knowing that someone will jump out and be scary, but you just don't know when. That tension is dramatic irony: you know something more than the characters in the film. Now, take the typical comedy. There will probably be some type of "misunderstanding".

nine years old, Ron, without my parents or myself
knowing his whereabouts, decided to take a mile walk from
our home down to the library, which was, of course,
a public library, but not so public
for black folks when you're talking about 1959. So as he was walking in there, all these folks were
staring at him because it was white folk only and they were looking at
him saying, you know, "Who is this negro?" So he politely positioned
himself in line to check out his books. Well, this old librarian,
she says, "This library's not
for coloreds." He said, "Well, I would like
to check out these books." She says, "Young man, if you don't leave this
library right now, I'm gonna call the police." So he just propped himself up
on the counter... (laughs) and sat there and said,
"I'll wait." So, she called the police and
subsequently called my mother. The police came down,
two burly guys, come in and say, "Well,
where's the disturbance?" She pointed to the little
nine year old boy sitting up on the counter. He says, "Ma'am,
what's the problem?" So my mother, in the meanwhile,
she was called and she comes down there
praying the whole way there, "Lordy, Jesus, please don't let
them put my child in jail." And my mother asked
the librarian, "What's the problem?" "He wanted to check out
the book. You know your son shouldn't
be down here." And the police officer said, "Why don't you just give
the kid the books?" And my mother said, "He'll
take good care of them." And reluctantly, the librarian
gave Ron the books. And my mother said,
"What do you say?" He said, "Thank you, ma'am."
(laughs) Later on, as youngsters, a show came on TV called,
"Star Trek." Now, Star Trek showed
the future where there were black folk and white folk
working together, and I just looked at it
as science-fiction, because that wasn't gonna
happen, really. But Ronald saw it as
science-possibility, you know. He came up during a time
when there was Neil Armstrong
and all of those guys. So how was a colored boy from
South Carolina, wearing glasses, who never flew a plane, how was
he gonna become an astronaut? But Ron was the one
who didn't accept societal norms as
being his norm. That was for other people. And uh, he got to be aboard

**Transcript**:
♪♪ When he was
nine years old, Ron, without my parents or myself
knowing his whereabouts, decided to take a mile walk from
our home down to the library, which was, of course,
a public library, but not so public
for black folks when you're talking about 1959. So as he was walking in there, all these folks were
staring at him because it was white folk only and they were looking at
him saying, you know, "Who is this negro?" So he politely positioned
himself in line to check out his books. Well, this old librarian,
she says, "This library's not
for coloreds." He said, "Well, I would like
to check out these books." She says, "Young man, if you don't leave this
library right now, I'm gonna call the police." So he just propped himself up
on the counter... (laughs) and sat there and said,
"I'll wait." So, she called the police and
subsequently called my mother. The police came down,
two burly guys, come in and say, "Well,
where's the disturbance?" She pointed to the little
nine year old boy sitting up on the counter. He says, "Ma'am,
what's the problem?" So my mother, in the meanwhile,
she was called and she comes down there
praying the whole way there, "Lordy, Jesus, please don't let
them put my child in jail." And my mother asked
the librarian, "What's the problem?" "He wanted to check out
the book. You know your son shouldn't
be down here." And the police officer said, "Why don't you just give
the kid the books?" And my mother said, "He'll
take good care of them." And reluctantly, the librarian
gave Ron the books. And my mother said,
"What do you say?" He said, "Thank you, ma'am."
(laughs) Later on, as youngsters, a show came on TV called,
"Star Trek." Now, Star Trek showed
the future where there were black folk and white folk
working together, and I just looked at it
as science-fiction, because that wasn't gonna
happen, really. But Ronald saw it as
science-possibility, you know. He came up during a time
when there was Neil Armstrong
and all of those guys. So how was a colored boy from
South Carolina, wearing glasses, who never flew a plane, how was
he gonna become an astronaut? But Ron was the one
who didn't accept societal norms as
being his norm. That was for other people. And uh, he got to be aboard
his own Starship Enterprise. ♪♪ Closed Captions by CaptionLink

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I would like to introduce you
to my favorite parasite. There are millions that I could choose from and this is it: it's called the jewel wasp. You can find it 
in parts of Africa and Asia. It's a little under an inch long, and it is a beautiful looking parasite. Now, you may be saying to yourself, "This is not a parasite. It's not a tapeworm, it's not a virus, how could a wasp be a parasite?" You are probably thinking 
about regular wasps, you know, the ones that build 
paper nests as their house. Well, the thing is that the jewel wasp makes its house inside 
a living cockroach. Here's how it happens. A jewel wasp is flying around, 
looking for a cockroach. When it sees one, it lands 
and bites on its wing. So, I'll be the cockroach. Be-wha! Bewha! And the cockroach starts shaking it off, "Get away from me!" The wasp very quickly starts
stinging the cockroach. All of a sudden, the cockroach can't move, for about a minute. And then it recovers and stands up. It could run away now, but it doesn't. It just doesn't want to. It just stays there. It's become a zombie slave. Again, I'm not making this up. The wasp goes off, it walks away and finds a hole and digs it out, makes it into a burrow. It walks back. This can take up to half an hour. The cockroach is still there. What do we do now? The wasps grabs onto one of the antenna, bites down on it, of the cockroach, and pulls the cockroach. And the cockroach says, "Alright," and walks like a dog on a leash. The wasp takes it 
all the way down into the burrow. The cockroach says, "Nice place." The wasp takes care of some business and then goes and leaves the burrow and seals it shut, leaving the cockroach entombed 
in darkness, still alive. The cockroach says, "Alright, 
I'll stay here if you want." Now, I mentioned that 
the cockroach took care, ah, the wasp took care 
of a little business before it left the burrow. The business was laying an egg on the underside of the cockroach. The egg hatches. Out comes a wasp larva. It looks kind of like 
a maggot with big, nasty jaws. It chews a hole into the cockroach and starts to feed from the outside. It gets bigger, 
like you can see over here. And then when it gets big enough, it decides to crawl into the hole, into the cockroach. So now it's inside 
the still-living cockroach and the cockroach doesn't mind much. This goes on for about a month. The larva grows and grows and grows, then makes a pupa, 
kind of like a cocoon. Inside there it grows eyes, it grows wings, it grows legs, the cockroach is still alive, 
still waiting. Finally the wasp is ready to leave, and that's when the cockroach finally dies because the fullly-formed adult wasp crawls out of the cockroach's dying body. The wasp shakes itself off, climbs out of the burrow, goes and finds another wasp to mate with to start this whole, crazy cycle again. So, this is not science fiction, this happens every day, 
all over the world. And scientists are 
totally fascinated by this. They're just starting to figure out
how all this happens. And, when you really start 
to look at the science of it, you start to kind of respect 
this very creepy wasp. You see, the thing is that 
when it attacks the cockroach, it's not just stinging wildly, it delivers two precise stings. It knows this cockroach's nervous system like you know the back of your hand. The first sting goes to that spot there, called the "walking rhythm generators," and, as you can guess, those are the neurons that send signals to the legs to move. It blocks the channels 
that the neurons use to send these signals. So the cockroach wants to go, 
it wants to run away, but it can't because 
it can't move its legs. And that lasted for about a minute. This is really sophisticated pharmacology. We actually use the same method, a drug called Ivermectin, to cure river blindness, which is caused by a parasitic worm that gets into your eye. If you take Ivermectin, 
you paralyze the worm using the same strategy. Now, we discovered this in the 1970s, the wasp has been doing this for millions of years. Then comes the second sting. Now the second sting actually hits two places along the way. And to try to imagine how this can happen, I want you to picture yourself with a friend who's got a very long, very, very scary looking needle. And your friend, or at least you thought he was your friend, sticks it in your neck, goes into your skull, stops off at one part of your brain and injects some drugs, then keeps going in your brain and injects some more. These are two particular spots, marked here, "SEG", and you can see the tip of it in the brain, marked "Br". Now, we can do this, but it's really hard for us. It's called stereotactic drug delivery. You have to put a patient in a big metal frame to hold them still, you need CAT Scans to know where you're going, so you look at the picture and say, "Are we going the right way?" The jewel wasp has sensors on its stinger and scientists think that it can actually feel its way through the cockroach's brain until it gets to the exact, right place, and then penetrates an individual neuron and then delivers the goods. So, this is quite amazing stuff, and what seems to happen then is that the wasp is taking away the control that the cockroach has over its own body. It's taking away the cockroach's free will. We didn't really appreciate that cockroaches have free will until this wasp showed us. And, we have no idea how it's doing this, we don't know yet what the venom has in it and we don't know which circuits it's hitting in the cockroach's brain, and I think that's why this is, most of all, my favorite parasite because we have so much left to learn from it. Thank you very much.

you paralyze the worm using the same strategy. Now, we discovered this in the 1970s, the wasp has been doing this for millions of years. Then comes the second sting. Now the second sting actually hits two places along the way. And to try to imagine how this can happen, I want you to picture yourself with a friend who's got a very long, very, very scary looking needle. And your friend, or at least you thought he was your friend, sticks it in your neck, goes into your skull, stops off at one part of your brain and injects some drugs, then keeps going in your brain and injects some more. These are two particular spots, marked here, "SEG", and you can see the tip of it in the brain, marked "Br". Now, we can do this, but it's really hard for us. It's called stereotactic drug delivery. You have to put a patient in a big metal frame to hold them still, you need CAT Scans to know where you're going, so you look at the picture and say, "Are we going the right way?" The jewel wasp has sensors on its stinger and scientists think that it can actually feel its way through the cockroach's brain until it gets to the exact, right place, and then penetrates an individual neuron and then delivers the goods. So, this is quite amazing stuff, and what seems to happen then is that the wasp is taking away the control that the cockroach has over its own body. It's taking away the cockroach's free will. We didn't really appreciate that cockroaches have free will until this wasp showed us. And, we have no idea how it's doing this, we don't know yet what the venom has in it and we don't know which circuits it's hitting in the cockroach's brain, and I think that's why this is, most of all, my favorite parasite because we have so much left to learn from it. Thank you very much.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I would like to introduce you
to my favorite parasite. There are millions that I could choose from and this is it: it's called the jewel wasp. You can find it 
in parts of Africa and Asia. It's a little under an inch long, and it is a beautiful looking parasite. Now, you may be saying to yourself, "This is not a parasite. It's not a tapeworm, it's not a virus, how could a wasp be a parasite?" You are probably thinking 
about regular wasps, you know, the ones that build 
paper nests as their house. Well, the thing is that the jewel wasp makes its house inside 
a living cockroach. Here's how it happens. A jewel wasp is flying around, 
looking for a cockroach. When it sees one, it lands 
and bites on its wing. So, I'll be the cockroach. Be-wha! Bewha! And the cockroach starts shaking it off, "Get away from me!" The wasp very quickly starts
stinging the cockroach. All of a sudden, the cockroach can't move, for about a minute. And then it recovers and stands up. It could run away now, but it doesn't. It just doesn't want to. It just stays there. It's become a zombie slave. Again, I'm not making this up. The wasp goes off, it walks away and finds a hole and digs it out, makes it into a burrow. It walks back. This can take up to half an hour. The cockroach is still there. What do we do now? The wasps grabs onto one of the antenna, bites down on it, of the cockroach, and pulls the cockroach. And the cockroach says, "Alright," and walks like a dog on a leash. The wasp takes it 
all the way down into the burrow. The cockroach says, "Nice place." The wasp takes care of some business and then goes and leaves the burrow and seals it shut, leaving the cockroach entombed 
in darkness, still alive. The cockroach says, "Alright, 
I'll stay here if you want." Now, I mentioned that 
the cockroach took care, ah, the wasp took care 
of a little business before it left the burrow. The business was laying an egg on the underside of the cockroach. The egg hatches. Out comes a wasp larva. It looks kind of like 
a maggot with big, nasty jaws. It chews a hole into the cockroach and starts to feed from the outside. It gets bigger, 
like you can see over here. And then when it gets big enough, it decides to crawl into the hole, into the cockroach. So now it's inside 
the still-living cockroach and the cockroach doesn't mind much. This goes on for about a month. The larva grows and grows and grows, then makes a pupa, 
kind of like a cocoon. Inside there it grows eyes, it grows wings, it grows legs, the cockroach is still alive, 
still waiting. Finally the wasp is ready to leave, and that's when the cockroach finally dies because the fullly-formed adult wasp crawls out of the cockroach's dying body. The wasp shakes itself off, climbs out of the burrow, goes and finds another wasp to mate with to start this whole, crazy cycle again. So, this is not science fiction, this happens every day, 
all over the world. And scientists are 
totally fascinated by this. They're just starting to figure out
how all this happens. And, when you really start 
to look at the science of it, you start to kind of respect 
this very creepy wasp. You see, the thing is that 
when it attacks the cockroach, it's not just stinging wildly, it delivers two precise stings. It knows this cockroach's nervous system like you know the back of your hand. The first sting goes to that spot there, called the "walking rhythm generators," and, as you can guess, those are the neurons that send signals to the legs to move. It blocks the channels 
that the neurons use to send these signals. So the cockroach wants to go, 
it wants to run away, but it can't because 
it can't move its legs. And that lasted for about a minute. This is really sophisticated pharmacology. We actually use the same method, a drug called Ivermectin, to cure river blindness, which is caused by a parasitic worm that gets into your eye. If you take Ivermectin,

unless we do something to prevent it over the next 40 years we're facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale a cheery thought-- on this map every country that's colored blue has more than 20% of its population over the age of 65 this is the world we live in and this is the world your children will live in for 12,000 years the distribution of ages in the human population has looked like a pyramid with the oldest on top it's already flattening out by 2050 it's going to be a column and we'll start to invert this is why it's happening the average lifespan is more than doubled since 1840 and it's increasing currently at the rate of about 5 hours every day and this is why that's not entirely a good thing because over the age of 65 your risk of getting Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease will increase exponentially by 2050 there'll be about 32 million people in the United States over the age of 80 and unless we do something about it half of them will have Alzheimer's disease and 3 million more will have Parkinson's disease right now those and other neurologic diseases for which we have no cure or prevention cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year it'll be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 Alzheimer's disease starts when a protein that should be folded up properly mis folds into a kind of demented origami so one approach we're taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular scotch tape to hold the protein into its proper shape that would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do interestingly enough other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of MIS folded protein which suggests that the approach might be a general one and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases not just Alzheimer's disease there's also a fascinating connection to cancer here because people with neurologic diseases have a very low in cents of most cancers and this is a connection that most people aren't pursuing right now but which were fascinated by most of the important that all of the creative work in this area is being funded by private philanthropies and there's tremendous scope for additional private help here because the government has dropped the ball on much of this I'm afraid in the meantime while we're waiting for all these things to happen here's what you can do for yourself if you want to lower your risk of Parkinson's disease caffeine is protective to some extent nobody knows why head injuries are bad for you they lead to Parkinson's disease and the avian flu is also not a good idea as far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer's disease well it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer's disease you should also keep your blood pressure down because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer's disease it's also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma which is just Alzheimer's disease of the eye and of course when it comes to cognitive effects use it or lose it applies so you want to stay mentally stimulated but hey you're listening to me so you've got that covered and one final thing which people like me luck okay because the clock is ticking for all of us thank

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I got in my first car accident when I was sixteen. I had just gotten my license and I was driving home when a car pulled into the intersection and bang! It hit me. It had happened that quick. Bang! But when I play that memory back, it doesn't take two seconds. I see the tires of the car rolling through the stop sign, I have time to think, "You know, I think that car is going to hit me." I see the right-hand corner of the hood crumple up like tin foil, I see the red paint flake off and drift off into the air, I can see all of that, like it's happening in slow motion. In my memory, that experience takes ten seconds. But why? Why did that memory play back longer than the actual time it took? This is an interesting phenomenon and it's not just for car accidents, a roller coaster, or a first kiss. These events seem to take longer than they actually take. But why? And when it comes to writing about that experience, how do I get that peculiar feeling across? How do I slow down time as a writer? To get the answer, we have to visit Hollywood. You see, the way filmmakers create slow motion will tell us a lot about how writers can create slow motion. First, let's remember how film works. When the camera turns on, it's not recording motion, it's taking lots and lots of individual pictures. Then when those pictures are played back in the projector, they blend together and create the appearance of motion, like a flip book. So, let's imagine that a camera man needs to film his actress skipping through a field of daisies in regular motion. Ready, action. She skips across the field, he records it, and...cut. Let's say for the sake of easy math that our camera man took 50 pictures, 50 little frames on that length of film. Now, let's take that film and play it back at the rate of 50 frames per 5 seconds. This rate is constant, the projector will always go at the same speed. It's easy, we got 50 frames, so our film takes 5 seconds. She skips across the field... ...and cut! So, then, how do we slow down time in film? How do we create slow motion? Maybe this is a surprise, but we don't take less pictures, we take more pictures. Ready, action! She skips across the field, he records it, and cut. Now we have a lot of film, a long length, let's say 100 frames long. Now, when we play it back, it takes a longer time to get through, and there's the actress in slow motion. Skipping through the field of daisies! Which brings us now to writing. When you're writing a narrative, you may want to use slow motion in one of your scenes. It's a cool effect, just like it is in Hollywood, and it draws the reader's attention to important moments. Well, here's how you do it. You see, when we read, our brain makes the words into pictures and the pictures blend into action. So what we read is what we see in the time it takes us to read it. For example, imagine you're writing a narrative about your game-winning free throw in the championship game. Here's a moment as a writer that you might want to slow down time to really capture the second-by-second tension produced by the scene. You concentrate, you put the pencil to paper, you really want to slow down time, you write, "I shot the ball in the hoop. Time slowed down. Then we won." To read that, takes two seconds; therefore, your reader imagines a scene that takes two seconds. Ball goes up, comes down, done. See, even though you wrote, "time slowed down," you didn't achieve that effect for your reader. Just saying it doesn't make it happen. Now, let's take what we make about film, time slows down with more pictures, and try again. This time write A LOT more. "I bent my knees and held the ball loosely. Letting the ball bounce on the floor once more, I gathered my thoughts. This was the moment. My right arm extended as I released the ball with a gentle flick, it rotated slightly as it arched toward the rim. I held my breath. The ball nudged the back rim, falling through the net with a gentle, satisfying swish. And the crowd exploded from their seats." See, we just slowed down time through our writing. The bottom line is this: there are moments in life that take longer than they actually take. When you're planning out your narrative, think about those moments, those snippets of life that took longer than the watch: the moment of hearing bad news, the moment of hearing good news, the moment of exhilaration when you realize you hit the jump, or the moment when you realize you aren't going to land it. Once you identify these moments in your narrative, you can use this effect of slow motion when you write. Just remember, it's not enough to say, "time slowed down" and it's not enough to throw a couple adjectives in a sentence and call it done either. Descriptive writing is good writing, that's true. But if you want to express the feeling of slow motion in life, you have to actually take up more physical space on the page, use more film so to speak. In doing so, you will create tension and keep your reader interested. And that way, the next time you write, you'll control the camera of your own writing.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I got in my first car accident when I was sixteen. I had just gotten my license and I was driving home when a car pulled into the intersection and bang! It hit me. It had happened that quick. Bang! But when I play that memory back, it doesn't take two seconds. I see the tires of the car rolling through the stop sign, I have time to think, "You know, I think that car is going to hit me." I see the right-hand corner of the hood crumple up like tin foil, I see the red paint flake off and drift off into the air, I can see all of that, like it's happening in slow motion. In my memory, that experience takes ten seconds. But why? Why did that memory play back longer than the actual time it took? This is an interesting phenomenon and it's not just for car accidents, a roller coaster, or a first kiss. These events seem to take longer than they actually take. But why? And when it comes to writing about that experience, how do I get that peculiar feeling across? How do I slow down time as a writer? To get the answer, we have to visit Hollywood. You see, the way filmmakers create slow motion will tell us a lot about how writers can create slow motion. First, let's remember how film works. When the camera turns on, it's not recording motion, it's taking lots and lots of individual pictures. Then when those pictures are played back in the projector, they blend together and create the appearance of motion, like a flip book. So, let's imagine that a camera man needs to film his actress skipping through a field of daisies in regular motion. Ready, action. She skips across the field, he records it, and...cut. Let's say for the sake of easy math that our camera man took 50 pictures, 50 little frames on that length of film. Now, let's take that film and play it back at the rate of 50 frames per 5 seconds. This rate is constant, the projector will always go at the same speed. It's easy, we got 50 frames, so our film takes 5 seconds. She skips across the field... ...and cut! So, then, how do we slow down time in film? How do we create slow motion? Maybe this is a surprise, but we don't take less pictures, we take more pictures. Ready, action! She skips across the field, he records it, and cut. Now we have a lot of film, a long length, let's say 100 frames long. Now, when we play it back, it takes a longer time to get through, and there's the actress in slow motion. Skipping through the field of daisies! Which brings us now to writing. When you're writing a narrative, you may want to use slow motion in one of your scenes. It's a cool effect, just like it is in Hollywood, and it draws the reader's attention to important moments. Well, here's how you do it. You see, when we read, our brain makes the words into pictures and the pictures blend into action. So what we read is what we see in the time it takes us to read it. For example, imagine you're writing a narrative about your game-winning free throw in the championship game. Here's a moment as a writer that you might want to slow down time to really capture the second-by-second tension produced by the scene. You concentrate, you put the pencil to paper, you really want to slow down time, you write, "I shot the ball in the hoop. Time slowed down. Then we won." To read that, takes two seconds; therefore, your reader imagines a scene that takes two seconds. Ball goes up, comes down, done. See, even though you wrote, "time slowed down," you didn't achieve that effect for your reader. Just saying it doesn't make it happen. Now, let's take what we make about film, time slows down with more pictures, and try again. This time write A LOT more. "I bent my knees and held the ball loosely. Letting the ball bounce on the floor once more, I gathered my thoughts. This was the moment. My right arm extended as I released the ball with a gentle flick, it rotated slightly as it arched toward the rim. I held my breath. The ball nudged the back rim, falling through the net with a gentle, satisfying swish. And the crowd exploded from their seats." See, we just slowed down time through our writing. The bottom line is this: there are moments in life that take longer than they actually take. When you're planning out your narrative, think about those moments, those snippets of life that took longer than the watch: the moment of hearing bad news, the moment of hearing good news, the moment of exhilaration when you realize you hit the jump, or the moment when you realize you aren't going to land it. Once you identify these moments in your narrative, you can use this effect of slow motion when you write. Just remember, it's not enough to say, "time slowed down" and it's not enough to throw a couple adjectives in a sentence and call it done either. Descriptive writing is good writing, that's true. But if you want to express the feeling of slow motion in life, you have to actually take up more physical space on the page, use more film so to speak. In doing so, you will create tension and keep your reader interested. And that way, the next time you write, you'll control the camera of your own writing.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What does "going viral" on the internet really mean, and why does it happen so quickly? Why is a financial institution too big to fail? How does a virus in Africa end up in the United States in a matter of hours? Why are Facebook and Google such powerful companies at creating global connections? Well, in a word: networks. But what are networks? Everyone knows about their social network, but there are all different kinds of networks you probably haven't thought about. Networks are collections of links which combine by specific rules and behaviors if they are alive. We say that networks are alive because they are in constant change. Over time, the connections within a network migrate and concentrate in new places, forming evolving structures. How the evolution and concentration of constantly changing connections occurs is the subject of a whole discipline called network theory. We can think of networks as neighborhoods. Neighborhoods are defined by maps. A Google map demonstrates the relationship between locations in exactly the same fashion a network connects hubs and nodes, using streets as links to connect neighborhoods. The reason a network can expand and evolve so quickly is based upon a mathematical concept called power functions. A power function is a mathematical amplification mechanism, which over specific and very small ranges, accelerates changes logarithmically. That is, a very small change in one parameter produces a huge change in another over a very specific range of values. An example of how network structure emerges is the algorithm used by Google. As the number of links around a search term, say "friends", increases, connections begin to form among millions of different searches using the term "friend". What Google has cleverly accomplished is a real-time mathematical model for how to predict the emergence of growing connections among billions of search terms. The algorithm Google derived collects the number of references to any search object. As references to a search object increase, the number of links also increases, creating a node. As the node increases in size, it eventually becomes a hub, which links to many nodes. Networks will continue to emerge as new ways of connecting and creating neighborhoods are defined. Perhaps you can begin to see why networks are so powerful. As Google continues to collect the billions of daily searches, new clusters of links will rapidly emerge, forming additional and growing networks. Despite the logarithmic expansion of your network, the laws of six degrees of separation still apply. Therefore, if you explore a close friend or acquaintances in you Facebook network, everyone on average will be separated by six individuals or less and a map of your social network will create neighborhoods linked by common connections among friends.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar My name is Tom Chi. I spent two years of my life building the user experience team for the Google X division of Google, and it's a place I affectionately call the Department of Science Fiction because of the futuristic nature of the types of projects we took on: self-driving cars, Google Glass, and other things that you'll see soon enough. So, for those who haven't heard of this project, this is what Google Glass looks like. It allows you to overlay digital things into your eye sight while still maintaining being part of the world. So, if I, you know, were to pull out my cell phone and look into it, I'm basically out of this world now, like, I'm in my own little cell phone-tablet world, what have you. But, Google Glass has the vision of allowing us to continue to be in the world but also have access to the digital things that we need and love. Now, I am going to ask you a real simple question about Google Glass: how would you prototype this experience? How long do you think it would take you to make the first working version of the headset display? Okay, a little bit on the long side. The answer is one day. And here's what it looked like. So, basically the magic piece is the coat hanger. The coat hanger, I bent it in a specific shape and the top loop goes around your neck and then the bottom loop rests against your chest and it allows me to carry a piece of plexiglass on with a little sheet protector. So these are the things you put your book reports in so they don't get wet, I literally got at the drug store. You know, have it out at the end of the plexiglass and then it gets projected onto with the pico projector that's connected to a Netbook. And using this set-up, within one day we're already able to start having the experience of what it looks like to have digital things overlaid on your physical world, be able to move around with it, and also use the Netbook to try out tons and tons of different ideas around software. Now, after you start getting something like that working, you know, a really important problem comes up, like you're wearing this thing on your head, it's like a pair of glasses, so you don't have a mouse or a keyboard or a touchscreen, all the ways you are used to interacting with a machine. So, we thought for a second, well, maybe we could do something like, you know, what was shown in Minority Report. So, for folks who haven't seen that, basically Tom Cruise is manipulating software with his hands in front of his face and photos are flying over here and his email is over here and so on and so forth. So I'll ask the the same question again, how long do you think it would take to have the real experience of doing something like that? Two years, OK. Somebody said one day. 45 minutes. So here's how it looks. So you wear the thing that we saw that first time because you need some way to go project things, but what happens is we got two hairbands, which I think was the hardest part we had to do, ask people for their hairbands. But you put one hand in each hairband and attach that hairband, we tied a fishing line. And the fishing line goes over the top of a whiteboard and then goes down to this little assembly that's taped to the floor. And what this means is every time I move my hand in any direction, it adds tension to the line and it does the following with the assembly on the floor. So, the other end of the fishing wire is attached to a chopstick and it's not because I'm Asian, there's just a cafeteria nearby, I don't just carry chopsticks on me. But, I tied it to the end of a chopstick, I clipped it into a binder clip, and then put it over a pen, and basically what happens then is when you move your arm and it produces tension on the wire, the chopstick comes down like a lever and clicks a presentation clicker, one hand moves the presentation forward, the other hand moves the presentation backwards. So this was built in 45 minutes and that meant shortly afterwards, we were having experiences like looking at an image gallery and saying, "next image, next image, previous image," or looking at our emails and saying, "let me click into this email, let me click reply now." And this was exactly the experience of what it was like to go control software with your hands. And ultimately, what it taught us is we probably shouldn't have this in the product. We learned a lot of things about the social awkwardness of it and some of the ergonomic aspects of it that you couldn't have figured out ahead of just thinking about it. And, ergo the second prototyping rule, which is "doing is the best kind of thinking." They teach you to think a lot in school, but I think it is a little bit overrated. Now last example, you know, actually Google is not the first team that's tried to go make something like this and if you search for headset display, you get tons of images of teams that have built various systems like this, but I can tell you at a glance that none of these pieces of hardware are comfortable to wear for more than 15 minutes except for maybe the helmet over there, but then you got to wear a helmet. So, you know, how would you go figure out a way to go wear something like this comfortably? The answer is really basic materials: modeling wire, paper, clay, and using something like this is able to make something look like a pair of glasses really quickly. I cut out pieces of clay that weighed exactly the same amount as the electronic components that we were talking about putting on the device, wrapped it in paper so you didn't get clay on your face, and then taped it to the modeling wire in various places to go experiment with how a pair of glasses could fit on you. And, we discovered something really important then. Like, if you look at this drawing on the bottom, it turns out that the weight of a pair of glasses is actually mostly perceived through how much weight is on your nose. And, it also turns out that your ears can carry a lot more weight than your nose, and that is a totally different experiment, you can ask me about that. But, because of that fact, if you put weight behind your ears, it allows your ear to go act like the fulcrum of a lever and it then takes weight off of your nose on the front. And, actually, you can try this now, anybody with glasses, if you push very gently on the back of your glasses, you'll find, actually your glasses feel tremendously lighter. Now, this meant that we not only discovered something interesting about how to go, you know, that's useful for developing a device like this, we actually discovered something pretty fundamental that never been discovered about glasses, period. So, if you have really heavy glasses, you could do this and you would be more comfortable. Now, the last point I want to make is about two types of learning because through the process of rapid prototyping, you are able to learn very quickly. It's a very specific type of learning. The type of learning that you usually learn in school I call book learning. It comes from what humanity already knows and it's a necessary foundation for you guys to go and explore the world. But there is a totally different type of learning, which I call expansive learning, and this is the learning you do on behalf of humanity. Right? You are creating something new, you are expanding into the possibilities, and you're building the sphere of human knowledge in that process. And, we think about these things and as soon as you hear like, ok, the infinite realm of possibilities beyond the sphere of human knowledge, you might be thinking there's the scientists at the Large Hadron Collider who have these amazing instruments, like that's their job, right? But the truth is that this action is available to all of us, you know, it's not just for the scientists, it's also for the poet or the songwriter that expresses an emotion for the first time in a unique way. It's also for the person that has an amazing business idea that they're certain could help millions of lives. And, it's the realm of using paper, clay, and tape in order to go find a new insight in an ancient technology. So now that you know a lot about rapid prototyping, I'm excited to see what you do with it. Thank you.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar My name is Tom Chi. I spent two years of my life building the user experience team for the Google X division of Google, and it's a place I affectionately call the Department of Science Fiction because of the futuristic nature of the types of projects we took on: self-driving cars, Google Glass, and other things that you'll see soon enough. So, for those who haven't heard of this project, this is what Google Glass looks like. It allows you to overlay digital things into your eye sight while still maintaining being part of the world. So, if I, you know, were to pull out my cell phone and look into it, I'm basically out of this world now, like, I'm in my own little cell phone-tablet world, what have you. But, Google Glass has the vision of allowing us to continue to be in the world but also have access to the digital things that we need and love. Now, I am going to ask you a real simple question about Google Glass: how would you prototype this experience? How long do you think it would take you to make the first working version of the headset display? Okay, a little bit on the long side. The answer is one day. And here's what it looked like. So, basically the magic piece is the coat hanger. The coat hanger, I bent it in a specific shape and the top loop goes around your neck and then the bottom loop rests against your chest and it allows me to carry a piece of plexiglass on with a little sheet protector. So these are the things you put your book reports in so they don't get wet, I literally got at the drug store. You know, have it out at the end of the plexiglass and then it gets projected onto with the pico projector that's connected to a Netbook. And using this set-up, within one day we're already able to start having the experience of what it looks like to have digital things overlaid on your physical world, be able to move around with it, and also use the Netbook to try out tons and tons of different ideas around software. Now, after you start getting something like that working, you know, a really important problem comes up, like you're wearing this thing on your head, it's like a pair of glasses, so you don't have a mouse or a keyboard or a touchscreen, all the ways you are used to interacting with a machine. So, we thought for a second, well, maybe we could do something like, you know, what was shown in Minority Report. So, for folks who haven't seen that, basically Tom Cruise is manipulating software with his hands in front of his face and photos are flying over here and his email is over here and so on and so forth. So I'll ask the the same question again, how long do you think it would take to have the real experience of doing something like that? Two years, OK. Somebody said one day. 45 minutes. So here's how it looks. So you wear the thing that we saw that first time because you need some way to go project things, but what happens is we got two hairbands, which I think was the hardest part we had to do, ask people for their hairbands. But you put one hand in each hairband and attach that hairband, we tied a fishing line. And the fishing line goes over the top of a whiteboard and then goes down to this little assembly that's taped to the floor. And what this means is every time I move my hand in any direction, it adds tension to the line and it does the following with the assembly on the floor. So, the other end of the fishing wire is attached to a chopstick and it's not because I'm Asian, there's just a cafeteria nearby, I don't just carry chopsticks on me. But, I tied it to the end of a chopstick, I clipped it into a binder clip, and then put it over a pen, and basically what happens then is when you move your arm and it produces tension on the wire, the chopstick comes down like a lever and clicks a presentation clicker, one hand moves the presentation forward, the other hand moves the presentation backwards. So this was built in 45 minutes and that meant shortly afterwards, we were having experiences like looking at an image gallery and saying, "next image, next image, previous image," or looking at our emails and saying, "let me click into this email, let me click reply now." And this was exactly the experience of what it was like to go control software with your hands. And ultimately, what it taught us is we probably shouldn't have this in the product. We learned a lot of things about the social awkwardness of it and some of the ergonomic aspects of it that you couldn't have figured out ahead of just thinking about it. And, ergo the second prototyping rule, which is "doing is the best kind of thinking." They teach you to think a lot in school, but I think it is a little bit overrated. Now last example, you know, actually Google is not the first team that's tried to go make something like this and if you search for headset display, you get tons of images of teams that have built various systems like this, but I can tell you at a glance that none of these pieces of hardware are comfortable to wear for more than 15 minutes except for maybe the helmet over there, but then you got to wear a helmet. So, you know, how would you go figure out a way to go wear something like this comfortably? The answer is really basic materials: modeling wire, paper, clay, and using something like this is able to make something look like a pair of glasses really quickly. I cut out pieces of clay that weighed exactly the same amount as the electronic components that we were talking about putting on the device, wrapped it in paper so you didn't get clay on your face, and then taped it to the modeling wire in various places to go experiment with how a pair of glasses could fit on you. And, we discovered something really important then. Like, if you look at this drawing on the bottom, it turns out that the weight of a pair of glasses is actually mostly perceived through how much weight is on your nose. And, it also turns out that your ears can carry a lot more weight than your nose, and that is a totally different experiment, you can ask me about that. But, because of that fact, if you put weight behind your ears, it allows your ear to go act like the fulcrum of a lever and it then takes weight off of your nose on the front. And, actually, you can try this now, anybody with glasses, if you push very gently on the back of your glasses, you'll find, actually your glasses feel tremendously lighter. Now, this meant that we not only discovered something interesting about how to go, you know, that's useful for developing a device like this, we actually discovered something pretty fundamental that never been discovered about glasses, period. So, if you have really heavy glasses, you could do this and you would be more comfortable. Now, the last point I want to make is about two types of learning because through the process of rapid prototyping, you are able to learn very quickly. It's a very specific type of learning. The type of learning that you usually learn in school I call book learning. It comes from what humanity already knows and it's a necessary foundation for you guys to go and explore the world. But there is a totally different type of learning, which I call expansive learning, and this is the learning you do on behalf of humanity. Right? You are creating something new, you are expanding into the possibilities, and you're building the sphere of human knowledge in that process. And, we think about these things and as soon as you hear like, ok, the infinite realm of possibilities beyond the sphere of human knowledge, you might be thinking there's the scientists at the Large Hadron Collider who have these amazing instruments, like that's their job, right? But the truth is that this action is available to all of us, you know, it's not just for the scientists, it's also for the poet or the songwriter that expresses an emotion for the first time in a unique way. It's also for the person that has an amazing business idea that they're certain could help millions of lives. And, it's the realm of using paper, clay, and tape in order to go find a new insight in an ancient technology. So now that you know a lot about rapid prototyping, I'm excited to see what you do with it. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so indeed I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night but when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms work love and play and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the others is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age where is to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement but with serenity so since I tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson as for that first sphere of work I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing he had a huge ambition but it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame what it was for is to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it even as a child it seemed Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams he somehow had to escape that hardscrabble farm from which he was born no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there but he read books in every spare moment he could find it was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or Aesop's fables he was so excited he couldn't sleep he couldn't eat the great poet Emily Dickinson once said there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away how true for Lincoln though he never would travel to Europe he went with Shakespeare's Kings to marry England he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings but there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death his mother died when he was only nine years old his only sister Sara in childbirth a few years later and his first love and Rutledge at the age of 22 moreover when his mother Lay Dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an after world she simply said to him Abraham I'm going away from you now and I shall never return as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away dust to dust but only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion but followed by other cultures as well that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life you could live on in the memory of others your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence and that worthy ambition became his lodestar it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s three things had combined to lay him low he had broken his engagement with Mary Todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that his one intimate friend Joshua speed was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because speed's father had died and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room and his great friend speed went to his side and said Lincoln you must rally or you will die he said that I would just as soon die right now but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature he eventually won a seat in Congress he then ran twice for the Senate lost twice every one is broken by life Ernest Hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rivals and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet it was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought he look like a figurehead compared to these people they said why are you doing this Lincoln he said look these are the strongest and most able men in the country the country is in peril I need them by my side but perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in but it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strains and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external resume for one thing he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other people's point of view he repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility he shared credit with Eze assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008 he refused to be provoked he refused to be provoked by petty grievances he'd never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights and he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language in metaphors in stories and with the beauty of language almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul in 1863 when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed he brought his old friend Joshua speed back to the White House and remembered that conversation of decades before when he was so sad and he pointing to the proclamation said I believe in this measure my fondest hopes will be realized but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception so he put the pen down he said if ever my soul were in an act it is in this act but if I sign with a shaking hand posterity will say he hesitated so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand but even in his wildest dreams Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach I was so thrilled to find a interview with the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s and in it Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus where there were only wild barbarians who had never left this part of Russia knowing that Tolstoy was in their myths they asked him to tell stories of the great men of so I said I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great in Frederick great and Julius Caesar and they loved it but before I finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said but wait you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all we want to hear about that man who spoke with the voice of thunder who laughed like the sunrise who came from that place called America which is so far from here that if a young man should travel there he would be an old man when he arrived tell us of that man tell us of Abraham Lincoln he was stunned II told him everything he could about Lincoln and then in the interview he said what made Lincoln so great not as great a generalist Napoleon not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great but his greatness consisted and historians would roundly agree in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being so in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized that ambition that had allowed him to laborious Lee educate himself by himself to go through those string of political failures and the darkest days of the war his story would be told so as for that second sphere not of work but of love encompassing family friends and colleagues it too takes work and commitment the Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life when I helped him on his memoirs was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work power and individual success they need absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone my relationship with him began on a rather curious level I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old we had a big dance at the White House President Johnson did dance with me that night not that peculiar they're only three women out of the 16 White House fellows but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House but it was not to be that simple for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people I'd been active in the anti-vietnam war movement and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson which unfortunately came out in the New Republic two days after the dance in the White House the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power so I was certain he would kick me out of the program but instead surprising he said I'll bring her down here for a year if I can't win her over no one can so I did end up working for him in the White House eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with I like to believe it was because I was a good listener he was a great storyteller fabulous colorful anecdotal stories there was a problem with these stories however which I later discovered which is that half of them weren't true but they were great on the last so I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales but I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation so I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when I didn't have any at all everything was working perfectly until one day he said when he's discussed our relationship sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson and there was wine and cheese in a red check tablecloth all the romantic trappings and he started out Doris more than any other woman I have ever known and my heart sank and then he said you remind me of my mother it was it was pretty embarrassing given what was going on in my mind but I must say the older I've gotten the more I realized what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging line of a man a victor in a thousand contests three great civil rights laws Medicare aid to education and yet roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam and because he was so sad and so vulnerable he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power sharing his fears his sorrows and his worries and I'd like to believe that that privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then but it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life for on the surface Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside a penthouse in the city sailboats speedboats he had servants to answer any whim and he had a family who loved him deeply and yet years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family in recreation in sports or in hobbies it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family without work could not fill it as his spirit sagged his body deteriorated until I believe he slowly brought about his own death in those last years he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him he spoke with immense sadness in his voice saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children and their children in turn but it was too late despite all that power all that wealth he was alone when he finally died his ultimate terror realized so as for that third sphere of play which he never had learned to enjoy I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy enough so that a hobby a sport a love of music or art or literature or any form of recreation can provide true pleasure relaxation and replenishment so deep for instance was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theatre even during those dark days of the war he said when the lights went down in a Shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time but an even more important form of relaxation for him that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy was a love of somehow humor and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce a sidelight to the sadness he once said that he laughed so he did not cry that a good story for him was better than a drop of whiskey his storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois the lawyers and the judges would travel from one County Courthouse to the other and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories he would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales and all these stories became part of his memory bank so he could call on them whenever he needed to and they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument one of his favorite stories for example had to do with the Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen and his Lincoln told the story mr. Allen went to Britain after the war and the British people were still upset about losing the revolution so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse where he'd have to encounter it they figured he be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all and so they said we'll teach you see George Washington there oh yes he said perfectly appropriate place for him what do you mean they said well he said there's nothing to make an Englishman  faster than the sight of General George so you can imagine if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting he had hundreds of these stories you will have to relax so between his nightly treks to the theatre his storytelling and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry he found that form of play which carried him through his days in my own life I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work it all began when I was only six years old and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games so that when he went to work in New York during the day I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodger game now when you're only six years old and your father comes home every single night and listens to you as I now realize that I in excruciating detail recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon but he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story they think makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention in fact I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father because at first I'd be so excited I would blurt out the Dodgers won or the Dodgers lost which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling so I finally learned you had to stell a story from beginning to middle to end I must say so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession to sins that related to baseball the first occurred because the Dodger catcher Roy Campanella came to my hometown of Rockville Center Long Island just as it was in preparation for my First Holy Communion and I was so excited first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field but it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church when you were brought up as a Catholic you think if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church you'll be struck dead at the threshold so I went to my father in tears what are we going to do he said don't worry he's speaking at a parish hall we're sitting and folding chairs he's talking about sportsmanship it's not a sin but as I left that night I was certain that somehow I traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella and there were no indulgences around that I could buy so I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession I told the priest right away he said no problem it wasn't a religious service but then unfortunately said and what else my child and then came my seconds and I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church witching harm to others being mean to my sisters and he said to whom did you wish harm and I had to say that I wish that various New York Yankee players would break arms and legs and ankles so that the RET so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series he said how often do you make these horrible wishes and I had to say every night when I said my prayers so he said look I tell you something I love the Brooklyn Dodgers as you do but I promise you someday they will win fairly and squarely do not need to wish harm and others to make it happen oh yes I said but luckily my first confession to a baseball loving priest well though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s before I had gotten married and had my three sons I have passed his memory as well as his love of baseball onto my boys though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to LA I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston became an irrational Red Sox fan and I must say even now when I sit with my sons with our season tickets I can sometimes close my eyes against the Sun and imagine myself a young girl once more in the presence of my father watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below Jackie Robinson Roy Campanella Pee Wee Reese and Schneider I must say there is magic in these moments when I opened my eyes and I see my son's in the place where my father once sat I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told which is why in the end I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families and the public figures we have respected in our history just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe really can live on so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives thank you for letting me be that

[Music] [Music] so indeed I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night but when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms work love and play and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the others is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age where is to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement but with serenity so since I tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson as for that first sphere of work I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing he had a huge ambition but it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame what it was for is to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it even as a child it seemed Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams he somehow had to escape that hardscrabble farm from which he was born no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there but he read books in every spare moment he could find it was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or Aesop's fables he was so excited he couldn't sleep he couldn't eat the great poet Emily Dickinson once said there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away how true for Lincoln though he never would travel to Europe he went with Shakespeare's Kings to marry England he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings but there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death his mother died when he was only nine years old his only sister Sara in childbirth a few years later and his first love and Rutledge at the age of 22 moreover when his mother Lay Dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an after world she simply said to him Abraham I'm going away from you now and I shall never return as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away dust to dust but only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion but followed by other cultures as well that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life you could live on in the memory of others your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence and that worthy ambition became his lodestar it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s three things had combined to lay him low he had broken his engagement with Mary Todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that his one intimate friend Joshua speed was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because speed's father had died and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room and his great friend speed went to his side and said Lincoln you must rally or you will die he said that I would just as soon die right now but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature he eventually won a seat in Congress he then ran twice for the Senate lost twice every one is broken by life Ernest Hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rivals and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet it was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought he look like a figurehead compared to these people they said why are you doing this Lincoln he said look these are the strongest and most able men in the country the country is in peril I need them by my side but perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in but it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strains and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external resume for one thing he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other people's point of view he repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility he shared credit with Eze assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008 he refused to be provoked he refused to be provoked by petty grievances he'd never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights and he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language in metaphors in stories and with the beauty of language almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul in 1863 when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed he brought his old friend Joshua speed back to the White House and remembered that conversation of decades before when he was so sad and he pointing to the proclamation said I believe in this measure my fondest hopes will be realized but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception so he put the pen down he said if ever my soul were in an act it is in this act but if I sign with a shaking hand posterity will say he hesitated so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand but even in his wildest dreams Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach I was so thrilled to find a interview with the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s and in it Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus where there were only wild barbarians who had never left this part of Russia knowing that Tolstoy was in their myths they asked him to tell stories of the great men of so I said I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great in Frederick great and Julius Caesar and they loved it but before I finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said but wait you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all we want to hear about that man who spoke with the voice of thunder who laughed like the sunrise who came from that place called America which is so far from here that if a young man should travel there he would be an old man when he arrived tell us of that man tell us of Abraham Lincoln he was stunned II told him everything he could about Lincoln and then in the interview he said what made Lincoln so great not as great a generalist Napoleon not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great but his greatness consisted and historians would roundly agree in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being so in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized that ambition that had allowed him to laborious Lee educate himself by himself to go through those string of political failures and the darkest days of the war his story would be told so as for that second sphere not of work but of love encompassing family friends and colleagues it too takes work and commitment the Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life when I helped him on his memoirs was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work power and individual success they need absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone my relationship with him began on a rather curious level I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old we had a big dance at the White House President Johnson did dance with me that night not that peculiar they're only three women out of the 16 White House fellows but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House but it was not to be that simple for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people I'd been active in the anti-vietnam war movement and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson which unfortunately came out in the New Republic two days after the dance in the White House the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power so I was certain he would kick me out of the program but instead surprising he said I'll bring her down here for a year if I can't win her over no one can so I did end up working for him in the White House eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with I like to believe it was because I was a good listener he was a great storyteller fabulous colorful anecdotal stories there was a problem with these stories however which I later discovered which is that half of them weren't true but they were great on the last so I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales but I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation so I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when I didn't have any at all everything was working perfectly until one day he said when he's discussed our relationship sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson and there was wine and cheese in a red check tablecloth all the romantic trappings and he started out Doris more than any other woman I have ever known and my heart sank and then he said you remind me of my mother it was it was pretty embarrassing given what was going on in my mind but I must say the older I've gotten the more I realized what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging line of a man a victor in a thousand contests three great civil rights laws Medicare aid to education and yet roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam and because he was so sad and so vulnerable he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power sharing his fears his sorrows and his worries and I'd like to believe that that privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then but it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life for on the surface Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in

psychologist Erik Erikson he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms work love and play and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the others is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age where is to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement but with serenity so since I tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson as for that first sphere of work I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing he had a huge ambition but it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame what it was for is to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it even as a child it seemed Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams he somehow had to escape that hardscrabble farm from which he was born no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there but he read books in every spare moment he could find it was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or Aesop's fables he was so excited he couldn't sleep he couldn't eat the great poet Emily Dickinson once said there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away how true for Lincoln though he never would travel to Europe he went with Shakespeare's Kings to marry England he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings but there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death his mother died when he was only nine years old his only sister Sara in childbirth a few years later and his first love and Rutledge at the age of 22 moreover when his mother Lay Dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an after world she simply said to him Abraham I'm going away from you now and I shall never return as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away dust to dust but only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion but followed by other cultures as well that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life you could live on in the memory of others your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence and that worthy ambition became his lodestar it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s three things had combined to lay him low he had broken his engagement with Mary Todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that his one intimate friend Joshua speed was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because speed's father had died and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room and his great friend speed went to his side and said Lincoln you must rally or you will die he said that I would just as soon die right now but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature he eventually won a seat in Congress he then ran twice for the Senate lost twice every one is broken by life Ernest Hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rivals and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet it was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought he look like a figurehead compared to these people they said why are you doing this Lincoln he said look these are the strongest and most able men in the country the country is in peril I need them by my side but perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in but it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strains and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external resume for one thing he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other people's point of view he repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility he shared credit with Eze assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008 he refused to be provoked he refused to be provoked by petty grievances he'd never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights and he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language in metaphors in stories and with the beauty of language almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul in 1863 when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed he brought his old friend Joshua speed back to the White House and remembered that conversation of decades before when he was so sad and he pointing to the proclamation said I believe in this measure my fondest hopes will be realized but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception so he put the pen down he said if ever my soul were in an act it is in this act but if I sign with a shaking hand posterity will say he hesitated so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand but even in his wildest dreams Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach I was so thrilled to find a interview with the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s and in it Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus where there were only wild barbarians who had never left this part of Russia knowing that Tolstoy was in their myths they asked him to tell stories of the great men of so I said I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great in Frederick great and Julius Caesar and they loved it but before I finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said but wait you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all we want to hear about that man who spoke with the voice of thunder who laughed like the sunrise who came from that place called America which is so far from here that if a young man should travel there he would be an old man when he arrived tell us of that man tell us of Abraham Lincoln he was stunned II told him everything he could about Lincoln and then in the interview he said what made Lincoln so great not as great a generalist Napoleon not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great but his greatness consisted and historians would roundly agree in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being so in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized that ambition that had allowed him to laborious Lee educate himself by himself to go through those string of political failures and the darkest days of the war his story would be told so as for that second sphere not of work but of love encompassing family friends and colleagues it too takes work and commitment the Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life when I helped him on his memoirs was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work power and individual success they need absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone my relationship with him began on a rather curious level I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old we had a big dance at the White House President Johnson did dance with me that night not that peculiar they're only three women out of the 16 White House fellows but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House but it was not to be that simple for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people I'd been active in the anti-vietnam war movement and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson which unfortunately came out in the New Republic two days after the dance in the White House the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power so I was certain he would kick me out of the program but instead surprising he said I'll bring her down here for a year if I can't win her over no one can so I did end up working for him in the White House eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with I like to believe it was because I was a good listener he was a great storyteller fabulous colorful anecdotal stories there was a problem with these stories however which I later discovered which is that half of them weren't true but they were great on the last so I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales but I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation so I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when I didn't have any at all everything was working perfectly until one day he said when he's discussed our relationship sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson and there was wine and cheese in a red check tablecloth all the romantic trappings and he started out Doris more than any other woman I have ever known and my heart sank and then he said you remind me of my mother it was it was pretty embarrassing given what was going on in my mind but I must say the older I've gotten the more I realized what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging line of a man a victor in a thousand contests three great civil rights laws Medicare aid to education and yet roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam and because he was so sad and so vulnerable he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power sharing his fears his sorrows and his worries and I'd like to believe that that privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then but it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life for on the surface Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside a penthouse in the city sailboats speedboats he had servants to answer any whim and he had a family who loved him deeply and yet years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family in recreation in sports or in hobbies it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family without work could not fill it as his spirit sagged his body deteriorated until I believe he slowly brought about his own death in those last years he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him he spoke with immense sadness in his voice saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children and their children in turn but it was too late despite all that power all that wealth he was alone when he finally died his ultimate terror realized so as for that third sphere of play which he never had learned to enjoy I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy enough so that a hobby a sport a love of music or art or literature or any form of recreation can provide true pleasure relaxation and replenishment so deep for instance was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theatre even during those dark days of the war he said when the lights went down in a Shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time but an even more important form of relaxation for him that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy was a love of somehow humor and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce a sidelight to the sadness he once said that he laughed so he did not cry that a good story for him was better than a drop of whiskey his storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois the lawyers and the judges would travel from one County Courthouse to the other and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories he would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales and all these stories became part of his memory bank so he could call on them whenever he needed to and they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument one of his favorite stories for example had to do with the Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen and his Lincoln told the story mr. Allen went to Britain after the war and the British people were still upset about losing the revolution so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse where he'd have to encounter it they figured he be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all and so they said we'll teach you see George Washington there oh yes he said perfectly appropriate place for him what do you mean they said well he said there's nothing to make an Englishman  faster than the sight of General George so you can imagine if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting he had hundreds of these stories you will have to relax so between his nightly treks to the theatre his storytelling and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry he found that form of play which carried him through his days in my own life I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work it all began when I was only six years old and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games so that when he went to work in New York during the day I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodger game now when you're only six years old and your father comes home every single night and listens to you as I now realize that I in excruciating detail recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon but he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story they think makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention in fact I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father because at first I'd be so excited I would blurt out the Dodgers won or the Dodgers lost which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling so I finally learned you had to stell a story from beginning to middle to end I must say so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession to sins that related to baseball the first occurred because the Dodger catcher Roy Campanella came to my hometown of Rockville Center Long Island just as it was in preparation for my First Holy Communion and I was so excited first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field but it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church when you were brought up as a Catholic you think if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church you'll be struck dead at the threshold so I went to my father in tears what are we going to do he said don't worry he's speaking at a parish hall we're sitting and folding chairs he's talking about sportsmanship it's not a sin but as I left that night I was certain that somehow I traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella and there were no indulgences around that I could buy so I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession I told the priest right away he said no problem it wasn't a religious service but then unfortunately said and what else my child and then came my seconds and I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church witching harm to others being mean to my sisters and he said to whom did you wish harm and I had to say that I wish that various New York Yankee players would break arms and legs and ankles so that the RET so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series he said how often do you make these horrible wishes and I had to say every night when I said my prayers so he said look I tell you something I love the Brooklyn Dodgers as you do but I promise you someday they will win fairly and squarely do not need to wish harm and others to make it happen oh yes I said but luckily my first confession to a baseball loving priest well though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s before I had gotten married and had my three sons I have passed his memory as well as his love of baseball onto my boys though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to LA I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston became an irrational Red Sox fan and I must say even now when I sit with my sons with our season tickets I can sometimes close my eyes against the Sun and imagine myself a young girl once more in the presence of my father watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below Jackie Robinson Roy Campanella Pee Wee Reese and Schneider I must say there is magic in these moments when I opened my eyes and I see my son's in the place where my father once sat I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told which is why in the end I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families and the public figures we have respected in our history just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe really can live on so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives thank you for letting me be that storyteller today [Applause] [Applause] really wonderful thank you what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

[Music] [Music] so indeed I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night but when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms work love and play and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of

of General George so you can imagine if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting he had hundreds of these stories you will have to relax so between his nightly treks to the theatre his storytelling and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry he found that form of play which carried him through his days in my own life I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work it all began when I was only six years old and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games so that when he went to work in New York during the day I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodger game now when you're only six years old and your father comes home every single night and listens to you as I now realize that I in excruciating detail recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon but he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story they think makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention in fact I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father because at first I'd be so excited I would blurt out the Dodgers won or the Dodgers lost which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling so I finally learned you had to stell a story from beginning to middle to end I must say so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession to sins that related to baseball the first occurred because the Dodger catcher Roy Campanella came to my hometown of Rockville Center Long Island just as it was in preparation for my First Holy Communion and I was so excited first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field but it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church when you were brought up as a Catholic you think if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church you'll be struck dead at the threshold so I went to my father in tears what are we going to do he said don't worry he's speaking at a parish hall we're sitting and folding chairs he's talking about sportsmanship it's not a sin but as I left that night I was certain that somehow I traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella and there were no indulgences around that I could buy so I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession I told the priest right away he said no problem it wasn't a religious service but then unfortunately said and what else my child and then came my seconds and I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church witching harm to others being mean to my sisters and he said to whom did you wish harm and I had to say that I wish that various New York Yankee players would break arms and legs and ankles so that the RET so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series he said how often do you make these horrible wishes and I had to say every night when I said my prayers so he said look I tell you something I love the Brooklyn Dodgers as you do but I promise you someday they will win fairly and squarely do not need to wish harm and others to make it happen oh yes I said but luckily my first confession to a baseball loving priest well though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s before I had gotten married and had my three sons I have passed his memory as well as his love of baseball onto my boys though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to LA I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston became an irrational Red Sox fan and I must say even now when I sit with my sons with our season tickets I can sometimes close my eyes against the Sun and imagine myself a young girl once more in the presence of my father watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below Jackie Robinson Roy Campanella Pee Wee Reese and Schneider I must say there is magic in these moments when I opened my eyes and I see my son's in the place where my father once sat I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told which is why in the end I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families and the public figures we have respected in our history just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe really can live on so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives thank you for letting me be that storyteller today [Applause] [Applause] really wonderful thank you what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in industries like manufacturing and energy they're using predictive analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM er let's build a smarter planet

[Music] [Music] so indeed I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night but when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms work love and play and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the others is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age where is to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement but with serenity so since I tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson as for that first sphere of work I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing he had a huge ambition but it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame what it was for is to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it even as a child it seemed Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams he somehow had to escape that hardscrabble farm from which he was born no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there but he read books in every spare moment he could find it was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or Aesop's fables he was so excited he couldn't sleep he couldn't eat the great poet Emily Dickinson once said there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away how true for Lincoln though he never would travel to Europe he went with Shakespeare's Kings to marry England he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings but there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death his mother died when he was only nine years old his only sister Sara in childbirth a few years later and his first love and Rutledge at the age of 22 moreover when his mother Lay Dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an after world she simply said to him Abraham I'm going away from you now and I shall never return as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away dust to dust but only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion but followed by other cultures as well that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life you could live on in the memory of others your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence and that worthy ambition became his lodestar it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s three things had combined to lay him low he had broken his engagement with Mary Todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that his one intimate friend Joshua speed was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because speed's father had died and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room and his great friend speed went to his side and said Lincoln you must rally or you will die he said that I would just as soon die right now but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature he eventually won a seat in Congress he then ran twice for the Senate lost twice every one is broken by life Ernest Hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rivals and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet it was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought he look like a figurehead compared to these people they said why are you doing this Lincoln he said look these are the strongest and most able men in the country the country is in peril I need them by my side but perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in but it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strains and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external resume for one thing he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other people's point of view he repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility he shared credit with Eze assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008 he refused to be provoked he refused to be provoked by petty grievances he'd never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights and he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language in metaphors in stories and with the beauty of language almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul in 1863 when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed he brought his old friend Joshua speed back to the White House and remembered that conversation of decades before when he was so sad and he pointing to the proclamation said I believe in this measure my fondest hopes will be realized but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception so he put the pen down he said if ever my soul were in an act it is in this act but if I sign with a shaking hand posterity will say he hesitated so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand but even in his wildest dreams Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach I was so thrilled to find a interview with the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s and in it Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus where there were only wild barbarians who had never left this part of Russia knowing that Tolstoy was in their myths they asked him to tell stories of the great men of so I said I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great in Frederick great and Julius Caesar and they loved it but before I finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said but wait you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all we want to hear about that man who spoke with the voice of thunder who laughed like the sunrise who came from that place called America which is so far from here that if a young man should travel there he would be an old man when he arrived tell us of that man tell us of Abraham Lincoln he was stunned II told him everything he could about Lincoln and then in the interview he said what made Lincoln so great not as great a generalist Napoleon not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great but his greatness consisted and historians would roundly agree in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being so in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized that ambition that had allowed him to laborious Lee educate himself by himself to go through those string of political failures and the darkest days of the war his story would be told so as for that second sphere not of work but of love encompassing family friends and colleagues it too takes work and commitment the Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life when I helped him on his memoirs was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work power and individual success they need absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone my relationship with him began on a rather curious level I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old we had a big dance at the White House President Johnson did dance with me that night not that peculiar they're only three women out of the 16 White House fellows but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House but it was not to be that simple for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people I'd been active in the anti-vietnam war movement and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson which unfortunately came out in the New Republic two days after the dance in the White House the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power so I was certain he would kick me out of the program but instead surprising he said I'll bring her down here for a year if I can't win her over no one can so I did end up working for him in the White House eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with I like to believe it was because I was a good listener he was a great storyteller fabulous colorful anecdotal stories there was a problem with these stories however which I later discovered which is that half of them weren't true but they were great on the last so I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales but I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation so I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when I didn't have any at all everything was working perfectly until one day he said when he's discussed our relationship sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson and there was wine and cheese in a red check tablecloth all the romantic trappings and he started out Doris more than any other woman I have ever known and my heart sank and then he said you remind me of my mother it was it was pretty embarrassing given what was going on in my mind but I must say the older I've gotten the more I realized what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging line of a man a victor in a thousand contests three great civil rights laws Medicare aid to education and yet roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam and because he was so sad and so vulnerable he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power sharing his fears his sorrows and his worries and I'd like to believe that that privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then but it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life for on the surface Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside a penthouse in the city sailboats speedboats he had servants to answer any whim and he had a family who loved him deeply and yet years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family in recreation in sports or in hobbies it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family without work could not fill it as his spirit sagged his body deteriorated until I believe he slowly brought about his own death in those last years he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him he spoke with immense sadness in his voice saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children and their children in turn but it was too late despite all that power all that wealth he was alone when he finally died his ultimate terror realized so as for that third sphere of play which he never had learned to enjoy I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy enough so that a hobby a sport a love of music or art or literature or any form of recreation can provide true pleasure relaxation and replenishment so deep for instance was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theatre even during those dark days of the war he said when the lights went down in a Shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time but an even more important form of relaxation for him that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy was a love of somehow humor and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce a sidelight to the sadness he once said that he laughed so he did not cry that a good story for him was better than a drop of whiskey his storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois the lawyers and the judges would travel from one County Courthouse to the other and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories he would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales and all these stories became part of his memory bank so he could call on them whenever he needed to and they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument one of his favorite stories for example had to do with the Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen and his Lincoln told the story mr. Allen went to Britain after the war and the British people were still upset about losing the revolution so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse where he'd have to encounter it they figured he be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all and so they said we'll teach you see George Washington there oh yes he said perfectly appropriate place for him what do you mean they said well he said there's nothing to make an Englishman  faster than the sight of General George so you can imagine if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting he had hundreds of these stories you will have to relax so between his nightly treks to the theatre his storytelling and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry he found that form of play which carried him through his days in my own life I shall always be grateful

who are we that is the big question and essentially we are just an upright walking big brain super intelligent ape this could be us we belong to the family called the humanity we are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens and it's important to remember that and in terms of our place in the world today and our future and planet Earth we are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today and that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times we're one species out of approximately one let's say at least sixteen upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years but as far as we know we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today except for the bonobos and it's important to remember that because the bonobos are so human and they share 99% of their genes with us and we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes it's important to remember that we evolved now I know that's a dirty word for some people but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas the chimpanzee and also the bonobos we have a common past and we have a common future and it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as an interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today and it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past and this is how we look for them a group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly off across vast areas of Africa looking for small fragments of bone fossil bone that may be on the surface and that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in northern Kenya looking for fossils I thought many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture but if you look very carefully there is a jaw no a jaw of a 4.1 million year old upright walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side it's extremely time consuming labor-intensive and it is something that it's going to involve a lot more people to begin to piece together our paths we still really haven't got a very complete picture of it when we find a fossil we market today we've got great technology we have GPS we mark it with a GPS fix and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen so we could essentially put it back on the surface exactly where we found it and we can bring all this information into big GIS packages today when we then find something very important like the bones of a human ancestor we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly using dental picks and fine paintbrushes and all the sediment is then put through these screens and where we go again through it very carefully looking for small bone fragments and it's been washed and these things are so exciting they are so often the only or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains and here is a very special moment when my mother and myself were digging up and some remains of human human ancestors and it isn't one of the most special things to ever do with your mother cannot many people look and say that but now let me take you back to Africa two million years ago I just like to point out if you look at the map of Africa it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden or runs down to Lake Malawi and the Rift Valley is a depression it's a basin and rivers flowed down from the highlands into the basin carrying sediment preserving the bones of animals that live there if you want to become a fossil you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you okay so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors because it's incredibly difficult eh for these things to become to be preserved and secondly for them to have been brought back up to the surface and we really have only spent fifty years looking for these remains and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story so that's good too Lake Turkana which is one such Lake basin in the very north of our country Kenya and if you look north here there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that live there fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin which represents some twenty thousand square miles that's a huge job that we've got on our hands two million years ago at Lake Turkana Homo erectus one of our human ancestors actually lived in this region you can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north but essentially two million years ago Homo erectus up in the far right corner lived alongside three other species of human ancestor and here is a skull of a homo erectus which have just pulled off the shelf there but it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm in fact if you go back in time it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids of human ancestors that coexist at any one time where did these things come from that's what we're still trying to find answers to and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species and our ancestors are no exception there's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana but I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains and we were able to dig up when we got old enough fossils such as this a slender snouted crocodile and we dug up giant tortoises and elephants and things like that but when I was 12 as I was in this picture a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well because I was the same age that he was when he died and I imagined him to be tall dark skinned his brother certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey probably sweating heavily as they did so he was very able to use stones effectively as tools and this individual himself this one that I'm holding up here actually had a bad back he probably had an injury as a child he the scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female and probably much smaller members of his family group to have got to where he did in life age 12 unfortunately for him he fell into a swamp and was and couldn't get out essentially his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved and he remained there until 1.6 million years later when this very famous fossil hunter Camille Camille walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles recognized it as as being hominid it it's actually this little piece up here on the top well an excavation was begun immediately and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment and what was so fun about it was the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree and fairly recently the tree had grown up but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope we began to find limb bones we found finger bones the bones of the pelvis vertebrae ribs collarbones things that had never ever been seen before and in Homo erectus it was truly exciting he had a body very similar to our own and he was on the threshold of becoming human well it's shortly afterwards members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia and China and also in parts of Indonesia so Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe some exciting finds again as I mentioned from Dmanisi in the Republic of Georgia but also surprising finds from recently announced from the island of Flores in Indonesia where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated and have become dwarfed and they're only about a metre in height but they lived only 18,000 years ago and that is truly extraordinary to think about just to put this in terms of generations because people do find it hard to think of time Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago we evolved essentially from an African stock again at about 200,000 years as a fully fledged us and we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago and until 30,000 years ago at least three upright-walking its shared the planet earth the question now is for who who are we were certainly a polluting wasteful aggressive species with a few nice things thrown in perhaps for the most part but you're not particularly pleasant at all we have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors is this a good evolutionary adaptation or is it going to lead us to being the shortest lived hominid species on planet earth and what is it that really makes us us I think it's our collective intelligence it's our ability to write things down our language and our consciousness from very primitive beginnings with a very crude toolkit of stones we now have a very advanced toolkit and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels we've got buggies to Mars we've mapped the human genome and recently even created synthetic life thanks to craig Venter and we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world from extraordinary places even from within an excavation in northern Kenya we can talk to people about what we're doing as albor so clearly has reminded us we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth if you look at the the fossil record for about on average a million years at a time we've only been around for the past 200 thousand years as a species yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people and last year our population grew by 80 million I mean these are extraordinary numbers you can see here again taken from Al Gore's book but what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth we have to control our numbers and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today but we have to control our numbers because we can't really hold it together as a species my father so appropriately put it that we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species can we hold it together it's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa we all have an African origin we have a common past and we share a common future evolutionary speaking we're just a blip we're sitting on the edge of a precipice we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today we could tell every single human being out there if we really wanted to but will we do that or will we just let nature take its course well to end on a very positive note I think evolutionary speaking this is probably a fairly good thing in the end I'll leave it at that thank you very much you

**Transcript**:
who are we that is the big question and essentially we are just an upright walking big brain super intelligent ape this could be us we belong to the family called the humanity we are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens and it's important to remember that and in terms of our place in the world today and our future and planet Earth we are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today and that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times we're one species out of approximately one let's say at least sixteen upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years but as far as we know we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today except for the bonobos and it's important to remember that because the bonobos are so human and they share 99% of their genes with us and we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes it's important to remember that we evolved now I know that's a dirty word for some people but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas the chimpanzee and also the bonobos we have a common past and we have a common future and it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as an interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today and it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past and this is how we look for them a group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly off across vast areas of Africa looking for small fragments of bone fossil bone that may be on the surface and that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in northern Kenya looking for fossils I thought many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture but if you look very carefully there is a jaw no a jaw of a 4.1 million year old upright walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side it's extremely time consuming labor-intensive and it is something that it's going to involve a lot more people to begin to piece together our paths we still really haven't got a very complete picture of it when we find a fossil we market today we've got great technology we have GPS we mark it with a GPS fix and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen so we could essentially put it back on the surface exactly where we found it and we can bring all this information into big GIS packages today when we then find something very important like the bones of a human ancestor we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly using dental picks and fine paintbrushes and all the sediment is then put through these screens and where we go again through it very carefully looking for small bone fragments and it's been washed and these things are so exciting they are so often the only or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains and here is a very special moment when my mother and myself were digging up and some remains of human human ancestors and it isn't one of the most special things to ever do with your mother cannot many people look and say that but now let me take you back to Africa two million years ago I just like to point out if you look at the map of Africa it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden or runs down to Lake Malawi and the Rift Valley is a depression it's a basin and rivers flowed down from the highlands into the basin carrying sediment preserving the bones of animals that live there if you want to become a fossil you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you okay so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors because it's incredibly difficult eh for these things to become to be preserved and secondly for them to have been brought back up to the surface and we really have only spent fifty years looking for these remains and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story so that's good too Lake Turkana which is one such Lake basin in the very

and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels we've got buggies to Mars we've mapped the human genome and recently even created synthetic life thanks to craig Venter and we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world from extraordinary places even from within an excavation in northern Kenya we can talk to people about what we're doing as albor so clearly has reminded us we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth if you look at the the fossil record for about on average a million years at a time we've only been around for the past 200 thousand years as a species yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people and last year our population grew by 80 million I mean these are extraordinary numbers you can see here again taken from Al Gore's book but what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth we have to control our numbers and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today but we have to control our numbers because we can't really hold it together as a species my father so appropriately put it that we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species can we hold it together it's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa we all have an African origin we have a common past and we share a common future evolutionary speaking we're just a blip we're sitting on the edge of a precipice we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today we could tell every single human being out there if we really wanted to but will we do that or will we just let nature take its course well to end on a very positive note I think evolutionary speaking this is probably a fairly good thing in the end I'll leave it at that thank you very much you

**Transcript**:
who are we that is the big question and essentially we are just an upright walking big brain super intelligent ape this could be us we belong to the family called the humanity we are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens and it's important to remember that and in terms of our place in the world today and our future and planet Earth we are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today and that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times we're one species out of approximately one let's say at least sixteen upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years but as far as we know we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today except for the bonobos and it's important to remember that because the bonobos are so human and they share 99% of their genes with us and we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes it's important to remember that we evolved now I know that's a dirty word for some people but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas the chimpanzee and also the bonobos we have a common past and we have a common future and it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as an interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today and it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past and this is how we look for them a group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly off across vast areas of Africa looking for small fragments of bone fossil bone that may be on the surface and that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in northern Kenya looking for fossils I thought many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture but if you look very carefully there is a jaw no a jaw of a 4.1 million year old upright walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side it's extremely time consuming labor-intensive and it is something that it's going to involve a lot more people to begin to piece together our paths we still really haven't got a very complete picture of it when we find a fossil we market today we've got great technology we have GPS we mark it with a GPS fix and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen so we could essentially put it back on the surface exactly where we found it and we can bring all this information into big GIS packages today when we then find something very important like the bones of a human ancestor we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly using dental picks and fine paintbrushes and all the sediment is then put through these screens and where we go again through it very carefully looking for small bone fragments and it's been washed and these things are so exciting they are so often the only or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains and here is a very special moment when my mother and myself were digging up and some remains of human human ancestors and it isn't one of the most special things to ever do with your mother cannot many people look and say that but now let me take you back to Africa two million years ago I just like to point out if you look at the map of Africa it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden or runs down to Lake Malawi and the Rift Valley is a depression it's a basin and rivers flowed down from the highlands into the basin carrying sediment preserving the bones of animals that live there if you want to become a fossil you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you okay so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors because it's incredibly difficult eh for these things to become to be preserved and secondly for them to have been brought back up to the surface and we really have only spent fifty years looking for these remains and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story so that's good too Lake Turkana which is one such Lake basin in the very north of our country Kenya and if you look north here there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that live there fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin which represents some twenty thousand square miles that's a huge job that we've got on our hands two million years ago at Lake Turkana Homo erectus one of our human ancestors actually lived in this region you can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north but essentially two million years ago Homo erectus up in the far right corner lived alongside three other species of human ancestor and here is a skull of a homo erectus which have just pulled off the shelf there but it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm in fact if you go back in time it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids of human ancestors that coexist at any one time where did these things come from that's what we're still trying to find answers to and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species and our ancestors are no exception there's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana but I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains and we were able to dig up when we got old enough fossils such as this a slender snouted crocodile and we dug up giant tortoises and elephants and things like that but when I was 12 as I was in this picture a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well because I was the same age that he was when he died and I imagined him to be tall dark skinned his brother certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey probably sweating heavily as they did so he was very able to use stones effectively as tools and this individual himself this one that I'm holding up here actually had a bad back he probably had an injury as a child he the scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female and probably much smaller members of his family group to have got to where he did in life age 12 unfortunately for him he fell into a swamp and was and couldn't get out essentially his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved and he remained there until 1.6 million years later when this very famous fossil hunter Camille Camille walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles recognized it as as being hominid it it's actually this little piece up here on the top well an excavation was begun immediately and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment and what was so fun about it was the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree and fairly recently the tree had grown up but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope we began to find limb bones we found finger bones the bones of the pelvis vertebrae ribs collarbones things that had never ever been seen before and in Homo erectus it was truly exciting he had a body very similar to our own and he was on the threshold of becoming human well it's shortly afterwards members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia and China and also in parts of Indonesia so Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe some exciting finds again as I mentioned from Dmanisi in the Republic of Georgia but also surprising finds from recently announced from the island of Flores in Indonesia where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated and have become dwarfed and they're only about a metre in height but they lived only 18,000 years ago and that is truly extraordinary to think about just to put this in terms of generations because people do find it hard to think of time Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago we evolved essentially from an African stock again at about 200,000 years as a fully fledged us and we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago and until 30,000 years ago at least three upright-walking its shared the planet earth the question now is for who who are we were certainly a polluting wasteful aggressive species with a few nice things thrown in perhaps for the most part but you're not particularly pleasant at all we have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors is this a good evolutionary adaptation or is it going to lead us to being the shortest lived hominid species on planet earth and what is it that really makes us us I think it's our collective intelligence it's our ability to write things down our language and our consciousness from very primitive beginnings with a very crude toolkit of stones we now have a very advanced toolkit and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels we've got buggies to Mars we've mapped the human genome and recently even created synthetic life thanks to craig Venter and we've also managed

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You look down and see a yellow pencil lying on your desk. Your eyes, and then your brain, are collecting all sorts of information about the pencil: its size, color, shape, distance, and more. But, how exactly does this happen? The ancient Greeks were the first to think more or less scientifically about what light is and how vision works. Some Greek philosophers, including Plato and Pythagoras, thought that light originated in our eyes and that vision happened when little, invisible probes were sent to gather information about far-away objects. It took over a thousand years before the Arab scientist, Alhazen, figured out that the old, Greek theory of light couldn't be right. In Alhazen's picture, your eyes don't send out invisible, intelligence-gathering probes, they simply collect the light that falls into them. Alhazen's theory accounts for a fact that the Greek's couldn't easily explain: why it gets dark sometimes. The idea is that very few objects actually emit their own light. The special, light-emitting objects, like the sun or a lightbulb, are known as sources of light. Most of the things we see, like that pencil on your desk, are simply reflecting light from a source rather than producing their own. So, when you look at your pencil, the light that hits your eye actually originated at the sun and has traveled millions of miles across empty space before bouncing off the pencil and into your eye, which is pretty cool when you think about it. But, what exactly is the stuff that is emitted from the sun and how do we see it? Is it a particle, like atoms, or is it a wave, like ripples on the surface of a pond? Scientists in the modern era would spend a couple of hundred years figuring out the answer to this question. Isaac Newton was one of the earliest. Newton believed that light is made up of tiny, atom-like particles, which he called corpuscles. Using this assumption, he was able to explain some properties of light. For example, refraction, which is how a beam of light appears to bend as it passes from air into water. But, in science, even geniuses sometimes get things wrong. In the 19th century, long after Newton died, scientists did a series of experiments that clearly showed that light can't be made up of tiny, atom-like particles. For one thing, two beams of light that cross paths don't interact with each other at all. If light were made of tiny, solid balls, then you would expect that some of the particles from Beam A would crash into some of the particles from Beam B. If that happened, the two particles involved in the collision would bounce off in random directions. But, that doesn't happen. The beams of light pass right through each other as you can check for yourself with two laser pointers and some chalk dust. For another thing, light makes interference patterns. Interference patterns are the complicated undulations that happen when two wave patterns occupy the same space. They can be seen when two objects disturb the surface of a still pond, and also when two point-like sources of light are placed near each other. Only waves make interference patterns, particles don't. And, as a bonus, understanding that light acts like a wave leads naturally to an explanation of what color is and why that pencil looks yellow. So, it's settled then, light is a wave, right? Not so fast! In the 20th century, scientists did experiments that appear to show light acting like a particle. For instance, when you shine light on a metal, the light transfers its energy to the atoms in the metal in discrete packets called quanta. But, we can't just forget about properties like interference, either. So these quanta of light aren't at all like the tiny, hard spheres Newton imagined. This result, that light sometimes behaves like a particle and sometimes behaves like a wave, led to a revolutionary new physics theory called quantum mechanics. So, after all that, let's go back to the question, "What is light?" Well, light isn't really like anything we're used to dealing with in our everyday lives. Sometimes it behaves like a particle and other times it behaves like a wave, but it isn't exactly like either.

Interference patterns are the complicated undulations that happen when two wave patterns occupy the same space. They can be seen when two objects disturb the surface of a still pond, and also when two point-like sources of light are placed near each other. Only waves make interference patterns, particles don't. And, as a bonus, understanding that light acts like a wave leads naturally to an explanation of what color is and why that pencil looks yellow. So, it's settled then, light is a wave, right? Not so fast! In the 20th century, scientists did experiments that appear to show light acting like a particle. For instance, when you shine light on a metal, the light transfers its energy to the atoms in the metal in discrete packets called quanta. But, we can't just forget about properties like interference, either. So these quanta of light aren't at all like the tiny, hard spheres Newton imagined. This result, that light sometimes behaves like a particle and sometimes behaves like a wave, led to a revolutionary new physics theory called quantum mechanics. So, after all that, let's go back to the question, "What is light?" Well, light isn't really like anything we're used to dealing with in our everyday lives. Sometimes it behaves like a particle and other times it behaves like a wave, but it isn't exactly like either.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You look down and see a yellow pencil lying on your desk. Your eyes, and then your brain, are collecting all sorts of information about the pencil: its size, color, shape, distance, and more. But, how exactly does this happen? The ancient Greeks were the first to think more or less scientifically about what light is and how vision works. Some Greek philosophers, including Plato and Pythagoras, thought that light originated in our eyes and that vision happened when little, invisible probes were sent to gather information about far-away objects. It took over a thousand years before the Arab scientist, Alhazen, figured out that the old, Greek theory of light couldn't be right. In Alhazen's picture, your eyes don't send out invisible, intelligence-gathering probes, they simply collect the light that falls into them. Alhazen's theory accounts for a fact that the Greek's couldn't easily explain: why it gets dark sometimes. The idea is that very few objects actually emit their own light. The special, light-emitting objects, like the sun or a lightbulb, are known as sources of light. Most of the things we see, like that pencil on your desk, are simply reflecting light from a source rather than producing their own. So, when you look at your pencil, the light that hits your eye actually originated at the sun and has traveled millions of miles across empty space before bouncing off the pencil and into your eye, which is pretty cool when you think about it. But, what exactly is the stuff that is emitted from the sun and how do we see it? Is it a particle, like atoms, or is it a wave, like ripples on the surface of a pond? Scientists in the modern era would spend a couple of hundred years figuring out the answer to this question. Isaac Newton was one of the earliest. Newton believed that light is made up of tiny, atom-like particles, which he called corpuscles. Using this assumption, he was able to explain some properties of light. For example, refraction, which is how a beam of light appears to bend as it passes from air into water. But, in science, even geniuses sometimes get things wrong. In the 19th century, long after Newton died, scientists did a series of experiments that clearly showed that light can't be made up of tiny, atom-like particles. For one thing, two beams of light that cross paths don't interact with each other at all. If light were made of tiny, solid balls, then you would expect that some of the particles from Beam A would crash into some of the particles from Beam B. If that happened, the two particles involved in the collision would bounce off in random directions. But, that doesn't happen. The beams of light pass right through each other as you can check for yourself with two laser pointers and some chalk dust. For another thing, light makes interference patterns. Interference patterns are the complicated undulations that happen when two wave patterns occupy the same space.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You know what the greatest secret of history is? It's that history can be changed. And, yeah, yeah, I know, everyone says history can't be changed, but it can. And today we're going to talk about how history isn't just something that goes backwards, history goes forward too. And all those great things that haven't happened yet, that's history that's just waiting to be written. So how do you change history? I'm going to tell you by sharing with you the three things that I tell my kids every night when I tuck them into bed. It's true. I stole the idea from a friend of mine who told me what his father used to share with him. Every single night, when I tuck my kids into bed, I tell them these three things: dream big, work hard, and stay humble. So let's look at them all. First, dream big. You know who has the biggest, best dreams of all? You, young people. You know how old Martin Luther King, Jr. was when he became the leader of the most famous bus boycott in history? He was 26. You know how old Amelia Earhart was when she broke her first world record? 25 You know how old Steve Jobs was when he co-founded Apple Computer? 21 And you know how old Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were when they came up with their idea for the greatest superhero of all time, the first one, that they named "Superman"? These guys were 17 years old! Two 17-year-old kids created Superman. They weren't good looking. (Look at the picture, right?) They weren't popular. They had no money, but they were two best friends with one dream. And with just their imaginations, they gave the world Superman. And I know, creating Superman is a once-in-a-lifetime big dream, so I want to tell you about Alexandra Scott. She goes by Alex. Alex was diagnosed with cancer before she was even a year old, and that was the only life she knew: sickness, chemotherapy, and surgery. When she was four, Alex asked her parents could she put a lemonade stand in the front yard? She didn't want to buy anything for herself, she wanted to use the money to give it to doctors to help other kids with cancer. OK, in a single day, Alex's lemonade stand raised $2,000! But, here's what I love: soon after that, other lemonade stands started popping up, all with Alex's name on it. Eventually, they raised $200,000. And then Alex had a new goal. She said let's raise $1,000,000. On June 12, 2004, hundreds of lemonade stands started opening up in every state in the country. Ordinary people selling water and sugar and lemons to help kids with cancer. Nearly two months later, Alex died while her parents were holding her hands. She was 8 years old. But before she died, Alex said that next year's goal should be $5,000,000. Today, her dream has raised over $45,000,000 and it is still going strong! One idea, one girl, one big dream. And you know what she said? This is a direct quote before she died. She said, "Oh, we can do it! If other people will help me, I think we can do it. I know we can do it!" You dream big, I don't care how old you are, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise, you will change history. And that leads me to the second thing I tell my kids: work hard. Such a simple one, everyone knows this one. Work hard. I saw this one for my father and my father died a few months ago. When I was growing up in Brooklyn, ok, my father, he worked hard. He had no money, we had, no money growing up. He worked every Saturday, every Sunday. I watched first-hand every weekend what hard work was. And I saw that the hardest work of all is being resilient when you're facing failure. When I started writing my first book, my first book got me 24 rejection letters. To be clear, there are only 20 publishers, I got 24 rejection letters, OK? That means that some people were writing me twice to make sure I got the point. But it wasn't until I was writing my ninth book, a book of heroes for my son, that I found my favorite story of working hard through failure. It was a story that a friend told me about the Wright brothers. That every time the Wright brothers went out to fly their plane, they would bring enough extra materials for multiple crashes. That means for every time they went out, they knew they would fail. And they would crash and rebuild, and crash and rebuild, and that's why they took off. I love that story. I wanted my son to hear that story, I wanted my daughter to hear that story, I wanted everyone to know that if you dream big and you work hard and you fight failure, you will change history and do what no one on this planet has ever done before. And that leads me to the final thing I tell them: stay humble. Here's the thing: if you invent the world's first airplane, or Superman, or a multi-million dollar lemonade stand, you don't need to be humble. You can get a tattoo on your face that says, "I'm the best!" Right? But pay attention here: no one likes a jerk. In fact, the world needs fewer loudmouths, so stay humble! When Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, you know he never took credit for writing it while he was alive? It wasn't until he died and it was in his obituary that the average American found out that he was the author. That's humble. So there's the big secret: dream big, work hard, stay humble. "Wait," you're saying, "that's it?" "What, you tell me a bunch of stories and what? How do I change history?" Here's the answer: all history ever is is a bunch of stories, conflicting stories, big stories, little stories, our stories. So how do you change history? All you got to do is write your story. OK? No, I'm serious, this is it. If people think history is a bunch of facts and dates you got to memorize, that's not what history is at all. History is a selection process, and it chooses every single one of us every single day. The only question is, do you hear the call? And that leads me to the most important thing I'm going to tell you here: you will change history. Some of you will change it in big ways, affecting millions of people. Others of you will do it in more personal ways, helping a family member or someone who needs it. But let me tell you right now, one is not more important than the other. If you help people in mass or one-by-one, that's how history gets changed, when you take action. But when you start writing your story and you get scared, as we all inevitably do, I want you to know one thing: no one is born a hero. Every single person that we talked about today, whether they were a 26 year old preacher, or two 17 year old nerds, or little girl who had cancer, every single one of them had moments where they doubted themselves, like you, like me. They had moments where they worried about school and friendships and would they be accepted by others, like you, like me. They had moments where they worried about loneliness and failure and would they ever succeed, like you, like me. But the best part is, you don't have to start a multi-million dollar lemonade stand to change the world, all you got to do is help one person, be kind to one person, that's the answer. It's my core belief, it is in every story I just told you. I believe ordinary people change the world. I don't care how much money you have, I don't care where you go to school, that is all nonsense to me. I believe in regular people and their ability to affect change in this world. I believe in my father, and a 25 year old daredevil named Amelia, and a little girl who sells lemonade like nobody's business. And it's why I believe in that very first hero we were talking about today, Superman. To me, the most important part of the story isn't Superman. The most important part of the story is Clark Kent. And you want to know why? Because we're all Clark Kent. We all know what it's like to be boring and ordinary and wish we could do something incredibly beyond ourselves. But here's the real news: we all can do something incredibly beyond ourselves. I got 24 rejection letters on my first book, 24 people who told me to give it up, and I don't look back on the experience and say, "I was right, and they were wrong, and haha on them." What I look back and realize is that every single one of those rejection letters told me to work harder, to dream bigger, and you better believe it, made me more humble, but it also made me want it more than anything. So whatever it is you dream big about, whatever it is you work hard for, don't let anyone tell you, you're too young and don't let anyone tell you no. Every life makes history. And every life is a story. Thank you.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You know what the greatest secret of history is? It's that history can be changed. And, yeah, yeah, I know, everyone says history can't be changed, but it can. And today we're going to talk about how history isn't just something that goes backwards, history goes forward too. And all those great things that haven't happened yet, that's history that's just waiting to be written. So how do you change history? I'm going to tell you by sharing with you the three things that I tell my kids every night when I tuck them into bed. It's true. I stole the idea from a friend of mine who told me what his father used to share with him. Every single night, when I tuck my kids into bed, I tell them these three things: dream big, work hard, and stay humble. So let's look at them all. First, dream big. You know who has the biggest, best dreams of all? You, young people. You know how old Martin Luther King, Jr. was when he became the leader of the most famous bus boycott in history? He was 26. You know how old Amelia Earhart was when she broke her first world record? 25 You know how old Steve Jobs was when he co-founded Apple Computer? 21 And you know how old Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were when they came up with their idea for the greatest superhero of all time, the first one, that they named "Superman"? These guys were 17 years old! Two 17-year-old kids created Superman. They weren't good looking. (Look at the picture, right?) They weren't popular. They had no money, but they were two best friends with one dream. And with just their imaginations, they gave the world Superman. And I know, creating Superman is a once-in-a-lifetime big dream, so I want to tell you about Alexandra Scott. She goes by Alex. Alex was diagnosed with cancer before she was even a year old, and that was the only life she knew: sickness, chemotherapy, and surgery. When she was four, Alex asked her parents could she put a lemonade stand in the front yard? She didn't want to buy anything for herself, she wanted to use the money to give it to doctors to help other kids with cancer. OK, in a single day, Alex's lemonade stand raised $2,000! But, here's what I love: soon after that, other lemonade stands started popping up, all with Alex's name on it. Eventually, they raised $200,000. And then Alex had a new goal. She said let's raise $1,000,000. On June 12, 2004, hundreds of lemonade stands started opening up in every state in the country. Ordinary people selling water and sugar and lemons to help kids with cancer. Nearly two months later, Alex died while her parents were holding her hands. She was 8 years old. But before she died, Alex said that next year's goal should be $5,000,000. Today, her dream has raised over $45,000,000 and it is still going strong! One idea, one girl, one big dream. And you know what she said? This is a direct quote before she died. She said, "Oh, we can do it! If other people will help me, I think we can do it. I know we can do it!" You dream big, I don't care how old you are, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise, you will change history. And that leads me to the second thing I tell my kids: work hard. Such a simple one, everyone knows this one. Work hard. I saw this one for my father and my father died a few months ago. When I was growing up in Brooklyn, ok, my father, he worked hard. He had no money, we had, no money growing up. He worked every Saturday, every Sunday. I watched first-hand every weekend what hard work was. And I saw that the hardest work of all is being resilient when you're facing failure. When I started writing my first book, my first book got me 24 rejection letters. To be clear, there are only 20 publishers, I got 24 rejection letters, OK? That means that some people were writing me twice to make sure I got the point. But it wasn't until I was writing my ninth book, a book of heroes for my son, that I found my favorite story of working hard through failure. It was a story that a friend told me about the Wright brothers. That every time the Wright brothers went out to fly their plane, they would bring enough extra materials for multiple crashes. That means for every time they went out, they knew they would fail. And they would crash and rebuild, and crash and rebuild, and that's why they took off. I love that story. I wanted my son to hear that story, I wanted my daughter to hear that story, I wanted everyone to know that if you dream big and you work hard and you fight failure, you will change history and do what no one on this planet has ever done before. And that leads me to the final thing I tell them: stay humble. Here's the thing: if you invent the world's first airplane, or Superman, or a multi-million dollar lemonade stand, you don't need to be humble. You can get a tattoo on your face that says, "I'm the best!" Right? But pay attention here: no one likes a jerk. In fact, the world needs fewer loudmouths, so stay humble! When Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, you know he never took credit for writing it while he was alive? It wasn't until he died and it was in his obituary that the average American found out that he was the author. That's humble. So there's the big secret: dream big, work hard, stay humble. "Wait," you're saying, "that's it?" "What, you tell me a bunch of stories and what? How do I change history?" Here's the answer: all history ever is is a bunch of stories, conflicting stories, big stories, little stories, our stories. So how do you change history? All you got to do is write your story. OK? No, I'm serious, this is it. If people think history is a bunch of facts and dates you got to memorize, that's not what history is at all. History is a selection process, and it chooses every single one of us every single day. The only question is, do you hear the call? And that leads me to the most important thing I'm going to tell you here: you will change history. Some of you will change it in big ways, affecting millions of people. Others of you will do it in more personal ways, helping a family member or someone who needs it. But let me tell you right now, one is not more important than the other. If you help people in mass or one-by-one, that's how history gets changed, when you take action. But when you start writing your story and you get scared, as we all inevitably do, I want you to know one thing: no one is born a hero.

You know how old Amelia Earhart was when she broke her first world record? 25 You know how old Steve Jobs was when he co-founded Apple Computer? 21 And you know how old Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were when they came up with their idea for the greatest superhero of all time, the first one, that they named "Superman"? These guys were 17 years old! Two 17-year-old kids created Superman. They weren't good looking. (Look at the picture, right?) They weren't popular. They had no money, but they were two best friends with one dream. And with just their imaginations, they gave the world Superman. And I know, creating Superman is a once-in-a-lifetime big dream, so I want to tell you about Alexandra Scott. She goes by Alex. Alex was diagnosed with cancer before she was even a year old, and that was the only life she knew: sickness, chemotherapy, and surgery. When she was four, Alex asked her parents could she put a lemonade stand in the front yard? She didn't want to buy anything for herself, she wanted to use the money to give it to doctors to help other kids with cancer. OK, in a single day, Alex's lemonade stand raised $2,000! But, here's what I love: soon after that, other lemonade stands started popping up, all with Alex's name on it. Eventually, they raised $200,000. And then Alex had a new goal. She said let's raise $1,000,000. On June 12, 2004, hundreds of lemonade stands started opening up in every state in the country. Ordinary people selling water and sugar and lemons to help kids with cancer. Nearly two months later, Alex died while her parents were holding her hands. She was 8 years old. But before she died, Alex said that next year's goal should be $5,000,000. Today, her dream has raised over $45,000,000 and it is still going strong! One idea, one girl, one big dream. And you know what she said? This is a direct quote before she died. She said, "Oh, we can do it! If other people will help me, I think we can do it. I know we can do it!" You dream big, I don't care how old you are, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise, you will change history. And that leads me to the second thing I tell my kids: work hard. Such a simple one, everyone knows this one. Work hard. I saw this one for my father and my father died a few months ago. When I was growing up in Brooklyn, ok, my father, he worked hard. He had no money, we had, no money growing up. He worked every Saturday, every Sunday. I watched first-hand every weekend what hard work was. And I saw that the hardest work of all is being resilient when you're facing failure. When I started writing my first book, my first book got me 24 rejection letters. To be clear, there are only 20 publishers, I got 24 rejection letters, OK? That means that some people were writing me twice to make sure I got the point. But it wasn't until I was writing my ninth book, a book of heroes for my son, that I found my favorite story of working hard through failure. It was a story that a friend told me about the Wright brothers. That every time the Wright brothers went out to fly their plane, they would bring enough extra materials for multiple crashes. That means for every time they went out, they knew they would fail. And they would crash and rebuild, and crash and rebuild, and that's why they took off. I love that story. I wanted my son to hear that story, I wanted my daughter to hear that story, I wanted everyone to know that if you dream big and you work hard and you fight failure, you will change history and do what no one on this planet has ever done before. And that leads me to the final thing I tell them: stay humble. Here's the thing: if you invent the world's first airplane, or Superman, or a multi-million dollar lemonade stand, you don't need to be humble. You can get a tattoo on your face that says, "I'm the best!" Right? But pay attention here: no one likes a jerk. In fact, the world needs fewer loudmouths, so stay humble! When Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, you know he never took credit for writing it while he was alive? It wasn't until he died and it was in his obituary that the average American found out that he was the author. That's humble. So there's the big secret: dream big, work hard, stay humble. "Wait," you're saying, "that's it?" "What, you tell me a bunch of stories and what? How do I change history?" Here's the answer: all history ever is is a bunch of stories, conflicting stories, big stories, little stories, our stories. So how do you change history? All you got to do is write your story. OK? No, I'm serious, this is it. If people think history is a bunch of facts and dates you got to memorize, that's not what history is at all. History is a selection process, and it chooses every single one of us every single day. The only question is, do you hear the call? And that leads me to the most important thing I'm going to tell you here: you will change history. Some of you will change it in big ways, affecting millions of people. Others of you will do it in more personal ways, helping a family member or someone who needs it. But let me tell you right now, one is not more important than the other. If you help people in mass or one-by-one, that's how history gets changed, when you take action. But when you start writing your story and you get scared, as we all inevitably do, I want you to know one thing: no one is born a hero. Every single person that we talked about today, whether they were a 26 year old preacher, or two 17 year old nerds, or little girl who had cancer, every single one of them had moments where they doubted themselves, like you, like me. They had moments where they worried about school and friendships and would they be accepted by others, like you, like me. They had moments where they worried about loneliness and failure and would they ever succeed, like you, like me. But the best part is, you don't have to start a multi-million dollar lemonade stand to change the world, all you got to do is help one person, be kind to one person, that's the answer. It's my core belief, it is in every story I just told you. I believe ordinary people change the world. I don't care how much money you have, I don't care where you go to school, that is all nonsense to me. I believe in regular people and their ability to affect change in this world. I believe in my father, and a 25 year old daredevil named Amelia, and a little girl who sells lemonade like nobody's business. And it's why I believe in that very first hero we were talking about today, Superman. To me, the most important part of the story isn't Superman. The most important part of the story is Clark Kent. And you want to know why? Because we're all Clark Kent. We all know what it's like to be boring and ordinary and wish we could do something incredibly beyond ourselves. But here's the real news: we all can do something incredibly beyond ourselves. I got 24 rejection letters on my first book, 24 people who told me to give it up, and I don't look back on the experience and say, "I was right, and they were wrong, and haha on them." What I look back and realize is that every single one of those rejection letters told me to work harder, to dream bigger, and you better believe it, made me more humble, but it also made me want it more than anything. So whatever it is you dream big about, whatever it is you work hard for, don't let anyone tell you, you're too young and don't let anyone tell you no. Every life makes history. And every life is a story. Thank you.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You know what the greatest secret of history is? It's that history can be changed. And, yeah, yeah, I know, everyone says history can't be changed, but it can. And today we're going to talk about how history isn't just something that goes backwards, history goes forward too. And all those great things that haven't happened yet, that's history that's just waiting to be written. So how do you change history? I'm going to tell you by sharing with you the three things that I tell my kids every night when I tuck them into bed. It's true. I stole the idea from a friend of mine who told me what his father used to share with him. Every single night, when I tuck my kids into bed, I tell them these three things: dream big, work hard, and stay humble. So let's look at them all. First, dream big. You know who has the biggest, best dreams of all? You, young people. You know how old Martin Luther King, Jr. was when he became the leader of the most famous bus boycott in history? He was 26. You know how old Amelia Earhart was when she broke her first world record? 25 You know how old Steve Jobs was when he co-founded Apple Computer? 21 And you know how old Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were when they came up with their idea for the greatest superhero of all time, the first one, that they named "Superman"? These guys were 17 years old! Two 17-year-old kids created Superman. They weren't good looking. (Look at the picture, right?) They weren't popular.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Once upon a time in the magical and very round Land of Pi, there lived six swashbuckling musketeers. There names were Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. But each was known best by his or her mark: the two hands ready to catch a fly of Parentheses, the small and raised digits of Exponents, the mighty X of Multiplication, slash of Division, plus of Addition, and, well, you can guess the symbol by which little Subtraction was best known. The Land of Pi was not necessarily the most peaceful place, and that's why the numbers of the kingdom needed the musketeers. The Land of Pi had been ruled by the numbers as anarcho-syndicalist commune, each number with a vote, but, one powerful number from what we'll call the Imperial Senate, engineered a war between some robot things and the knights of the kingdom, and then installed himself as Supreme Emperor, and then Puff the Magic Digit Dragon ate him, and a princess or two, and, well, all the other numbers in the Land of Pi actually. It was kind of a big day. Anyway, the musketeers were called to action to save the Land of Pi from the voracious dragon. They rode towards him on their valiant steeds and attacked. First Multiplication, then Parentheses, but that didn't work. The dragon continued eating people. So Addition tried, but was thrown aside. Exponents leaped at the beast and was quickly squashed. Nothing was working. The musketeers huddled and formulated a plan. They would attack in sequence, but who should go first? They bickered for a while, the dragon ate a few more princesses, and then they finally agreed. They jumped into the first, smallest parentheses inside the great Puff the Digit Dragon. Parentheses pointed out where to work first and protected Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction while they diced and sliced. First here, then, move over there, then there. Look out! There's another set! Parentheses pointed and Exponents took the lead. Then, it was Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction, each in turn, always the same order. P-E-M-D-A-S When they finished that set, they went to another, and another, always working inside the parentheses in PEMDAS order. Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! PEMDAS, there is another spot! Don't forget, there can be parentheses inside parentheses. There's one! And that tricky exponent. There we go! Finally, the PEMDAS Musketeers had whittled Puff down to his last fearsome roar. But, having vanquished Puff the Magic Digit Dragon, all the empire's numbers sprang again from this tiny little number one, and they all lived happily ever after. Except for the Emperor Number, which they threw into the mouth of an ancient nesting creature in the desert. The End.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Once upon a time in the magical and very round Land of Pi, there lived six swashbuckling musketeers. There names were Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. But each was known best by his or her mark: the two hands ready to catch a fly of Parentheses, the small and raised digits of Exponents, the mighty X of Multiplication, slash of Division, plus of Addition, and, well, you can guess the symbol by which little Subtraction was best known. The Land of Pi was not necessarily the most peaceful place, and that's why the numbers of the kingdom needed the musketeers. The Land of Pi had been ruled by the numbers as anarcho-syndicalist commune, each number with a vote, but, one powerful number from what we'll call the Imperial Senate, engineered a war between some robot things and the knights of the kingdom, and then installed himself as Supreme Emperor, and then Puff the Magic Digit Dragon ate him, and a princess or two, and, well, all the other numbers in the Land of Pi actually. It was kind of a big day. Anyway, the musketeers were called to action to save the Land of Pi from the voracious dragon. They rode towards him on their valiant steeds and attacked. First Multiplication, then Parentheses, but that didn't work. The dragon continued eating people. So Addition tried, but was thrown aside. Exponents leaped at the beast and was quickly squashed. Nothing was working. The musketeers huddled and formulated a plan. They would attack in sequence, but who should go first? They bickered for a while, the dragon ate a few more princesses, and then they finally agreed. They jumped into the first, smallest parentheses inside the great Puff the Digit Dragon. Parentheses pointed out where to work first and protected Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction while they diced and sliced. First here, then, move over there, then there. Look out! There's another set! Parentheses pointed and Exponents took the lead. Then, it was Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction, each in turn, always the same order. P-E-M-D-A-S When they finished that set, they went to another, and another, always working inside the parentheses in PEMDAS order. Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! PEMDAS, there is another spot! Don't forget, there can be parentheses inside parentheses. There's one! And that tricky exponent. There we go! Finally, the PEMDAS Musketeers had whittled Puff down to his last fearsome roar. But, having vanquished Puff the Magic Digit Dragon, all the empire's numbers sprang again from this tiny little number one, and they all lived happily ever after. Except for the Emperor Number, which they threw into the mouth of an ancient nesting creature in the desert. The End.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar 9th of January, 2007 Joshua Bell, one of the greatest violinist in the world, played to a packed audience at Boston's stately Symphony Hall of 1,000 people where most seats went for more than $100. He was used to full, sell-out shows. He was at the peak of his abilities and fame. Three days later, Joshua Bell played to an audience of nobody! Well, maybe six people paused for a moment, and one child stopped for a while looking, as if he understood that something special was happening. Joshua said of the experience, "It was a strange feeling that people were actually ignoring me." Joshua Bell was playing violin in a subway station. "At a music hall, I'll get upset if someone coughs or if someone's cell phone goes off, but here my expectations quickly diminished. I was oddly grateful when somebody threw in a dollar." What changed? Same music, on the same violin, played with the same passion and by the same man. Why did people listen and then not listen? Aristotle would be able to explain. What does it take to persuade people? 2,300 years ago, Aristotle wrote the single most important work on persuasion, Rhetoric, the 3 means of persuasion: logos, ethos, and pathos. Logos is that the idea makes sense from the audience's point of view. This is usually different from the speaker's point of view, so work needs to be done to make the idea relevant to the world view, the pains and the challenges of the listeners. A good argument is like good music. Good music follows some rules of composition; good arguments follow some rules of logic. It makes sense to the audience. Ethos is reputation, what are you known for; credibility, do you look and act professional; trustworthy, are your motives clear, do you show the listener that you care about them as much as yourself? Authority is confidence plus a concise message, a clear, strong voice. Pathos is the emotional connection. Stories are an effective human tool for creating an emotional connection. There are moments where an audience is not ready to hear the message. A speaker must create the right emotional environment for their message. What changed? Why did people travel for miles to hear him play one night, and not even pause for moment to listen the next morning? The answer is that ethos and pathos were missing. Ethos The fact that the great concert hall hosts Joshua's concert transfers its trust to Joshua. We trust the institution, we now trust Joshua. The subway does not have our trust for musical talent, we do not expect to find great art, great music, or great ideas, so it confers no trust to Joshua. Pathos The concert hall is designed for an emotional bond between an audience and an artist, a subway platform is not. The hustle and movement and stress is just not conducive to the emotional connection needed between performer and listener. Logos, ethos, pathos, the idea is nothing without the rest. This is what Joshua Bell learned on that cold, January day in 2007. If you have a great idea, how do you build credibility and emotional connection?

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.5000 (The generated question is related to Aristotle's work on persuasion but does not directly ask about the author of "Rhetoric.")
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.0000 (The correct answer in the generated question does not match the ground truth answer, as it asks about the means of persuasion rather than the author.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.7500 (The distractors in the generated question are plausible alternatives, but their relevance is tied to the content of Aristotle's work rather than the authorship.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 0.9000 (Both the question and options are clear and understandable.)
- Total Score: 0.5375

Please note that the generated MCQ does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, so the evaluation scores are based on the closest available option. In an ideal scenario, a generated MCQ that directly asks about the author of "Rhetoric" would be required for a more accurate evaluation.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar 9th of January, 2007 Joshua Bell, one of the greatest violinist in the world, played to a packed audience at Boston's stately Symphony Hall of 1,000 people where most seats went for more than $100. He was used to full, sell-out shows. He was at the peak of his abilities and fame. Three days later, Joshua Bell played to an audience of nobody! Well, maybe six people paused for a moment, and one child stopped for a while looking, as if he understood that something special was happening. Joshua said of the experience, "It was a strange feeling that people were actually ignoring me." Joshua Bell was playing violin in a subway station. "At a music hall, I'll get upset if someone coughs or if someone's cell phone goes off, but here my expectations quickly diminished. I was oddly grateful when somebody threw in a dollar." What changed? Same music, on the same violin, played with the same passion and by the same man. Why did people listen and then not listen? Aristotle would be able to explain. What does it take to persuade people? 2,300 years ago, Aristotle wrote the single most important work on persuasion, Rhetoric, the 3 means of persuasion: logos, ethos, and pathos. Logos is that the idea makes sense from the audience's point of view. This is usually different from the speaker's point of view, so work needs to be done to make the idea relevant to the world view, the pains and the challenges of the listeners. A good argument is like good music. Good music follows some rules of composition; good arguments follow some rules of logic. It makes sense to the audience. Ethos is reputation, what are you known for; credibility, do you look and act professional; trustworthy, are your motives clear, do you show the listener that you care about them as much as yourself? Authority is confidence plus a concise message, a clear, strong voice. Pathos is the emotional connection. Stories are an effective human tool for creating an emotional connection. There are moments where an audience is not ready to hear the message. A speaker must create the right emotional environment for their message. What changed? Why did people travel for miles to hear him play one night, and not even pause for moment to listen the next morning? The answer is that ethos and pathos were missing. Ethos The fact that the great concert hall hosts Joshua's concert transfers its trust to Joshua. We trust the institution, we now trust Joshua. The subway does not have our trust for musical talent, we do not expect to find great art, great music, or great ideas, so it confers no trust to Joshua. Pathos The concert hall is designed for an emotional bond between an audience and an artist, a subway platform is not. The hustle and movement and stress is just not conducive to the emotional connection needed between performer and listener. Logos, ethos, pathos, the idea is nothing without the rest. This is what Joshua Bell learned on that cold, January day in 2007. If you have a great idea, how do you build credibility and emotional connection?

[Music] [Applause] good morning let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all Leonardo da Vinci we're all familiar with his fantastic work his drawings his paintings his inventions his writings but we do not know his face thousands of books have been written about him but there's controversy and it remains about his looks even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many other historians so what do you think is this the face of leonado Da Vinci or isn't it let's find out leonado was a man that Drew everything around him he drew people Anatomy plants animals Landscapes buildings water everything but no faces I find that hard to believe his contemporaries made faces like the ones you see here anas or 34s uh so surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time so let's try to find them I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits we would find his face looking at us so I looked at all of his drawings more than 700 and looked for male portraits there are about 120 you see them here which ones of these could be self-portraits well for that they have to be done as we just saw AAS or 3/ quarters so we can eliminate all the profiles it also has to be sufficiently detailed so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized and we know from his contemporaries that leonado was a very handsome even beautiful man so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures and look what happens only three candidates remain that fit the bill and here they are yes indeed the old man is there as is this famous pen drawing of the home of vranas and lastly the only portrait of a male that Leonard painted the musician and before we go into these faces I should explain why I have some right to talk about them I've made more than 1100 portraits myself for newspapers over the course of 300 30 years sorry 30 years only but there are 1100 and very few artists have drawn so many faces so I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces okay now let's look at these three portraits and hold on to your seats because if we zoom in on those faces remark how they have the same broad forehead the horizontal eyebrows the long nose the curved lips and the small well-developed chin I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that there is no reason why these portraits should look alike all we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait and look they do are very similar now are they made in the right order the young men should be made first and as you see here from the years that they were created it is indeed the case they are made in the right order what was the age of Leonardo at the time does that fit yes it does he was 33 38 and 63 when these were made so we have three pictures potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at that time but how do we know it's him and not someone else well we need a reference and here's the only the only picture of Leonardo that's why be accepted it's a statue made by veroo of David for which Leonard posed as a boy of 15 and if we now compare the face of the statue with the face of the musician you see the very same features again the statue is the reference and it connects the identity of leonado to those three faces ladies and gentlemen this story has not yet had been published it's only proper that you hear a t hear and see it first the icon of icons finally has a face here he is Leonardo [Music] DaVinci

**Transcript**:
it's a simple idea about nature and I want to I want to say a word for nature because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days I want to say a word for the soil and the bees the plants and the animals and tell you about a tool a very simple tool that I have found although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit it's not a technology is very powerful for I think changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend and that tool is very simply as Chris suggested looking at us and the world from the plants or the animals point of view it's not my idea other peoples have hit on it but I've tried to take it to some new places let me tell you where I got it like a lot of my ideas like a lot of the tools I use I found it in the garden I'm a very devoted gardener and there was a day about seven years ago I was planting potatoes it was the first week of May this is New England when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom they're just white clouds above I was here planting my chunks cutting up potatoes and planting it and the bees were working on this tree bumblebees just making this thing vibrate and one of the things I really like about gardening is that it doesn't take all your concentration you really can't get hurt it's not like woodworking and you can you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation and the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden was working alongside that bumblebee was what did I and that bumblebee have in common how was our role in this garden similar and different and I realized we actually had quite a bit in common both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another and both of us probably if I can imagine the bees point of view thought we were calling the shots I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant I picked my Yukon gold or yellow fin or whatever it was and I had some in those jeans from a seed catalog across the country brought it and I was planting it and that'd be no doubt assumed that it had decided I'm going for that apple tree I'm going for that blossom I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave we have a grammar that suggests that's who we are that we are sovereign subjects in nature the bee as well as me I plant the potatoes I weed the garden I domesticate the species but that day it occurred to me what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit because of course the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge and but we know better we know that what's going on between the B and that flower is that B has been cleverly manipulated by that flower and when I say manipulated I'm talking about in Darwinian sense right I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits color scent flavor pattern that has lured that B in and the B has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar and also picking up some powder on its leg and going off to the next blossom B is not calling the shots and I realized then I wasn't either I had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its into spreading its genes give me a little bit more habitat and that's when I got the idea which was what would it be what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who were working on us and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention not as a human technology but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species mostly edible grasses had exploited us figured out how to get us to basically DeForest the world the competition of grasses right and suddenly everything looked different and suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience I had thought always and in fact had written this in my first book was a book about gardening that lawns were nature under cultures but-- that they were totalitarian landscapes and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing this species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex and and that's what the lawn was but then I realize no this is exactly what the grasses want us to do I'm a dupe I'm a dupe of the lawns whose goal in life is to out-compete the trees who it competes with who they compete with for sunlight and so by getting us to mow the lawn we keep the trees from coming back which in in New England happens very very quickly so I started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called the bottom desire and I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the tastes and the desires of bees that they like sweetness that they like this color and not that color that they like symmetry what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing that a certain kind of potato a certain kind of drug a sativa indica cannabis cross has something to say about us and that wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world now the test of any idea I said it was a literary conceit is what does it get us and when you're talking about nature which is really my subject as a writer how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test which is does it make us better citizens of the biotic community get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota rather than its destruction and I would submit that this idea does this so let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way besides some you know entertaining insights about about human desire as an intellectual matter looking at the world from other species points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly which is intellection this is in the realm of intellectual history which is that we had this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago mini-me we have this intellectual referal this Darwinian revolution in which thanks to Darwin we figured out we are just one species among many evolutions working on us the same way it's working on all the others we are acted upon as well as acting we are really in the fiber of the fabric of life but the weird thing is we don't we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later none of us really believes this we are still Cartesians the children of Descartes who believe that subjectivity consciousness sets us apart that the world is divided into subjects and objects that there is nature on one side culture on another as soon as you start seeing things from the plan's point of view or the animals point of view you realize that the real literary conceit is that is this the idea that nature is opposed to culture the idea that that that consciousness is everything and that's another very important thing it does looking at the world from other species points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance you suddenly realize that consciousness which we value and we consider the you know the crown of the crowning achievement of nature human consciousness is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world and it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool but you know there's a comedian who said well who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important well consciousness so when you look at the plants you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting I'll give you two examples also from the garden lima beans you know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mic that comes in and attacks the spider mite defending the lima bean so what plants have while we have consciousness tool-making language they have biochemistry and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond can imagine and their complexity their sophistication is something to really marvel at and I think it's really the scandal of the human genome project you know we went into it thinking forty or fifty thousand human genes we came out with the only twenty three thousand just to give you a grounds for comparison rice 35,000 genes so who's the more sophisticated species well we're all equally sophisticated we've been involving evolving just as long just along different paths so cure for self-importance weight of sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea and that's really what I do as a writer as a storyteller is try to make people kind of feel what we know and tell stories that actually make us help us think ecologically now the other use of this is practical and I'm in tucked I'm going to take you to a farm right now as I use this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned in fact is that we are all now being manipulated by corn and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today to me is the final triumph of corn over good sense it is part of corns corn scheme for world domination and you will see the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us so but let me so it helped me understand industrial agriculture which of course is a Cartesian system it's based on this idea that we Bend other species to our will and that we are in charge and then we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want let me take you to a very different kind of farm this is farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species point of view are actually implemented and I found it in a man the farmers name is Joel Salatin and I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature and that is this the farm is called Polyface which means the idea is he's got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement it's permaculture those of you know a little bit about this such that the cows and the pigs and the em and the sheep and the turkeys and the what else what else does he have all the six different species rabbits actually are all performing ecological services for one another such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another and I can't it's a very elaborate and beautiful dance but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens his laying hens and I'll show you how if you take this approach what you get okay and this is a lot more than growing food as you'll see this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion that the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning and that for us to get what we want nature is diminished so one day cattle in a pen the only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing relatively new up to a car battery even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock set it up in 15 minutes cows graze one day they move okay they graze everything down intensive intensive grazing he waits three days and then we towed in something called the egg mobile the egg mobile is a very rickety contraption it looks like a Prairie schooner made out of boards but it houses 350 chickens he tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank turns them down and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank clucking gossiping as chickens will and they make a beeline for the cow patties and what they're doing is very interesting they're digging through the cow patties for the maggots the grub the larvae of flies and the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens favorite form of protein so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and there they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs and in the process they're spreading the manure out very useful at second echo system service and third while they're in this paddock there are of course defecating madly and and they're very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field they then move out to the next one and in the course of just a few weeks the grass just enters his blaze of growth and within four or five weeks he can do it again he can graze again you can cut they could bring in another species like the Lambs or he can um make hay for the winter now I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there so it's a very productive system and what I need to tell you is that on a hundred acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef 30,000 pounds of pork 25,000 dozen eggs 20,000 boilers a thousand turkeys a thousand rabbits an immense amount of food you know you here can organic feed the world well look how much food can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of again give each species what it want let it really realize its desires its physiological distinctiveness put that in play but look at it from the point of view of the grass now what happens to the grass when you do this when a ruminant grazes grass the grass is cut from this height to this height and it immediately does something very interesting anyone of you who Gardens knows that there is something called the root shoot ratio and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots they kind of cauterize them and the roots die and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots decomposing them the earthworms the fungi the bacteria and the result is new soil this is how soil is created it's created from the bottom up this is how the prairies were built the relationship between bison and grasses and what I realized when I understood this and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer he's not a sheep farmer he's not a cattle rancher he's a grass farmer because grass is really the keystone species of such a system is that if you think about it this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads which is that for us to get what we want nature is diminished more for us less for nature here all this food comes off this farm and at the end of the season there is actually more soil more fertility and more biodiversity it's a remarkably hopeful thing to do there are a lot of farmers doing this today this is well beyond organic agriculture which is still a Cartesian system more or less and what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species take account of the soil that even with with enough more than this perspectival idea because there is no technology involved here except for those fences which could be you know they're so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time that you can we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process this this is a way to reanimate the world and that's what's so exciting about this perspective when we really begin to feel darwin's insights in our bones the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very

**Transcript**:
it's a simple idea about nature and I want to I want to say a word for nature because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days I want to say a word for the soil and the bees the plants and the animals and tell you about a tool a very simple tool that I have found although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit it's not a technology is very powerful for I think changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend and that tool is very simply as Chris suggested looking at us and the world from the plants or the animals point of view it's not my idea other peoples have hit on it but I've tried to take it to some new places let me tell you where I got it like a lot of my ideas like a lot of the tools I use I found it in the garden I'm a very devoted gardener and there was a day about seven years ago I was planting potatoes it was the first week of May this is New England when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom they're just white clouds above I was here planting my chunks cutting up potatoes and planting it and the bees were working on this tree bumblebees just making this thing vibrate and one of the things I really like about gardening is that it doesn't take all your concentration you really can't get hurt it's not like woodworking and you can you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation and the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden was working alongside that bumblebee was what did I and that bumblebee have in common how was our role in this garden similar and different and I realized we actually had quite a bit in common both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another and both of us probably if I can imagine the bees point of view thought we were calling the shots I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant I picked my Yukon gold or yellow fin or whatever it was and I had some in those jeans from a seed catalog across the country brought it and I was planting it and that'd be no doubt assumed that it had decided I'm going for that apple tree I'm going for that blossom I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave we have a grammar that suggests that's who we are that we are sovereign subjects in nature the bee as well as me I plant the potatoes I weed the garden I domesticate the species but that day it occurred to me what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit because of course the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge and but we know better we know that what's going on between the B and that flower is that B has been cleverly manipulated by that flower and when I say manipulated I'm talking about in Darwinian sense right I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits color scent flavor pattern that has lured that B in and the B has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar and also picking up some powder on its leg and going off to the next blossom B is not calling the shots and I realized then I wasn't either I had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its into spreading its genes give me a little bit more habitat and that's when I got the idea which was what would it be what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who were working on us and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention not as a human technology but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species mostly edible grasses had exploited us figured out how to get us to basically DeForest the world the competition of grasses right and suddenly everything looked different and suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience I had thought always and in fact had written this in my first book was a book about gardening that lawns were nature under cultures but-- that they were totalitarian landscapes and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing this species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex and and that's what the lawn was but then I realize no this is exactly what the grasses want us to do I'm a dupe I'm a dupe of the lawns whose goal in life is to out-compete the trees who it competes with who they compete with for sunlight and so by getting us to mow the lawn we keep the trees from coming back which in in New England happens very very quickly so I started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called the bottom desire and I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the tastes and the desires of bees that they like sweetness that they like this color and not that color that they like symmetry what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing that a certain kind of potato a certain kind of drug a sativa indica cannabis cross has something to say about us and that wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world now the test of any idea I said it was a literary conceit is what does it get us and when you're talking about nature which is really my subject as a writer how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test which is does it make us better citizens of the biotic community get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota rather than its destruction and I would submit that this idea does this so let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way besides some you know entertaining insights about about human desire as an intellectual matter looking at the world from other species points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly which is intellection this is in the realm of intellectual history which is that we had this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago mini-me we have this intellectual referal this Darwinian revolution in which thanks to Darwin we figured out we are just one species among many evolutions working on us the same way it's working on all the others we are acted upon as well as acting we are really in the fiber of the fabric of life but the weird thing is we don't we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later none of us really believes this we are still Cartesians the children of Descartes who believe that subjectivity consciousness sets us apart that the world is divided into subjects and objects that there is nature on one side culture on another as soon as you start seeing things from the plan's point of view or the animals point of view you realize that the real literary conceit is that is this the idea that nature is opposed to culture the idea that that that consciousness is everything and that's another very important thing it does looking at the world from other species points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance you suddenly realize that consciousness which we value and we consider the you know the crown of the crowning achievement of nature human consciousness is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world and it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool but you know there's a comedian who said well who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important well consciousness so when you look at the plants you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting I'll give you two examples also from the garden lima beans you know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mic that comes in and attacks the spider mite defending the lima bean so what plants have while we have consciousness tool-making language they have biochemistry and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond can imagine and their complexity their sophistication is something to really marvel at and I think it's really the scandal of the human genome project you know we went into it thinking forty or fifty thousand human genes we came out with the only twenty three thousand just to give you a grounds for comparison rice 35,000 genes so who's the more sophisticated species well we're all equally sophisticated we've been involving evolving just as long just along different paths so cure for self-importance weight of sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea and that's really what I do as a writer as a storyteller is try to make people kind of feel what we know and tell stories that actually make us help us think ecologically now the other use of this is practical and I'm in tucked I'm going to take you to a farm right now as I use this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned in fact is that we are all now being manipulated by corn and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today to me is the final triumph of corn over good sense it is part of corns corn scheme for world domination and you will see the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us so but let me so it helped me understand industrial agriculture which of course is a Cartesian system it's based on this idea that we Bend other species to our will and that we are in charge and then we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want let me take you to a very different kind of farm this is farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species point of view are actually implemented and I found it in a man the farmers name is Joel Salatin and I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature and that is this the farm is called Polyface which means the idea is he's got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement it's permaculture those of you know a little bit about this such that the cows and the pigs and the em and the sheep and the turkeys and the what else what else does he have all the six different species rabbits actually are all performing ecological services for one another such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another and I can't it's a very elaborate and beautiful dance but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens his laying hens and I'll show you how if you take this approach what you get okay and this is a lot more than growing food as you'll see this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion that the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning and that for us to get what we want nature is diminished so one day cattle in a pen the only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing relatively new up to a car battery even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock set it up in 15 minutes cows graze one day they move okay they graze everything down intensive intensive grazing he waits three days and then we towed in something called the egg mobile the egg mobile is a very rickety contraption it looks like a Prairie schooner made out of boards but it houses 350 chickens he tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank turns them down and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank clucking gossiping as chickens will and they make a beeline for the cow patties and what they're doing is very interesting they're digging through the cow patties for the maggots the grub the larvae of flies and the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens favorite form of protein so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and there they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs and in the process they're spreading the manure out very useful at second echo system service and third while they're in this paddock there are of course defecating madly and and they're very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field they then move out to the next one and in the course of just a few weeks the grass just enters his blaze of growth and within four or five weeks he can do it again he can graze again you can cut they could bring in another species like the Lambs or he can um make hay for the winter now I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there so it's a very productive system and what I need to tell you is that on a hundred acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef 30,000 pounds of pork 25,000 dozen eggs 20,000 boilers a thousand turkeys a thousand rabbits an immense amount of food you know you here can organic feed the world well look how much food can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of again give each species what it want let it really realize its desires its physiological distinctiveness put that in play but look at it

we towed in something called the egg mobile the egg mobile is a very rickety contraption it looks like a Prairie schooner made out of boards but it houses 350 chickens he tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank turns them down and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank clucking gossiping as chickens will and they make a beeline for the cow patties and what they're doing is very interesting they're digging through the cow patties for the maggots the grub the larvae of flies and the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens favorite form of protein so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and there they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs and in the process they're spreading the manure out very useful at second echo system service and third while they're in this paddock there are of course defecating madly and and they're very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field they then move out to the next one and in the course of just a few weeks the grass just enters his blaze of growth and within four or five weeks he can do it again he can graze again you can cut they could bring in another species like the Lambs or he can um make hay for the winter now I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there so it's a very productive system and what I need to tell you is that on a hundred acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef 30,000 pounds of pork 25,000 dozen eggs 20,000 boilers a thousand turkeys a thousand rabbits an immense amount of food you know you here can organic feed the world well look how much food can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of again give each species what it want let it really realize its desires its physiological distinctiveness put that in play but look at it from the point of view of the grass now what happens to the grass when you do this when a ruminant grazes grass the grass is cut from this height to this height and it immediately does something very interesting anyone of you who Gardens knows that there is something called the root shoot ratio and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots they kind of cauterize them and the roots die and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots decomposing them the earthworms the fungi the bacteria and the result is new soil this is how soil is created it's created from the bottom up this is how the prairies were built the relationship between bison and grasses and what I realized when I understood this and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer he's not a sheep farmer he's not a cattle rancher he's a grass farmer because grass is really the keystone species of such a system is that if you think about it this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads which is that for us to get what we want nature is diminished more for us less for nature here all this food comes off this farm and at the end of the season there is actually more soil more fertility and more biodiversity it's a remarkably hopeful thing to do there are a lot of farmers doing this today this is well beyond organic agriculture which is still a Cartesian system more or less and what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species take account of the soil that even with with enough more than this perspectival idea because there is no technology involved here except for those fences which could be you know they're so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time that you can we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process this this is a way to reanimate the

**Transcript**:
it's a simple idea about nature and I want to I want to say a word for nature because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days I want to say a word for the soil and the bees the plants and the animals and tell you about a tool a very simple tool that I have found although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit it's not a technology is very powerful for I think changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend and that tool is very simply as Chris suggested looking at us and the world from the plants or the animals point of view it's not my idea other peoples have hit on it but I've tried to take it to some new places let me tell you where I got it like a lot of my ideas like a lot of the tools I use I found it in the garden I'm a very devoted gardener and there was a day about seven years ago I was planting potatoes it was the first week of May this is New England when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom they're just white clouds above I was here planting my chunks cutting up potatoes and planting it and the bees were working on this tree bumblebees just making this thing vibrate and one of the things I really like about gardening is that it doesn't take all your concentration you really can't get hurt it's not like woodworking and you can you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation and the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden was working alongside that bumblebee was what did I and that bumblebee have in common how was our role in this garden similar and different and I realized we actually had quite a bit in common both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another and both of us probably if I can imagine the bees point of view thought we were calling the shots I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant I picked my Yukon gold or yellow fin or whatever it was and I had some in those jeans from a seed catalog across the country brought it and I was planting it and that'd be no doubt assumed that it had decided I'm going for that apple tree I'm going for that blossom I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave we have a grammar that suggests that's who we are that we are sovereign subjects in nature the bee as well as me I plant the potatoes I weed the garden I domesticate the species but that day it occurred to me what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit because of course the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge and but we know better we know that what's going on between the B and that flower is that B has been cleverly manipulated by that flower and when I say manipulated I'm talking about in Darwinian sense right I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits color scent flavor pattern that has lured that B in and the B has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar and also picking up some powder on its leg and going off to the next blossom B is not calling the shots and I realized then I wasn't either I had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its into spreading its genes give me a little bit more habitat and that's when I got the idea which was what would it be what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who were working on us and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention not as a human technology but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species mostly edible grasses had exploited us figured out how to get us to basically DeForest the world the competition of grasses right and suddenly everything looked different and suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience I had thought always and in fact had written this in my first book was a book about gardening that lawns were nature under cultures but-- that they were totalitarian landscapes and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing this species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex and and that's what the lawn was but then I realize no this is exactly what the grasses want us to do I'm a dupe I'm a dupe of the lawns whose goal in life is to out-compete the trees who it competes with who they compete with for sunlight and so by getting us to mow the lawn we keep the trees from coming back which in in New England happens very very quickly so I started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called the bottom desire and I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the tastes and the desires of bees that they like sweetness that they like this color and not that color that they like symmetry what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing that a certain kind of potato a certain kind of drug a sativa indica cannabis cross has something to say about us and that wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world now the test of any idea I said it was a literary conceit is what does it get us and when you're talking about nature which is really my subject as a writer how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test which is does it make us better citizens of the biotic community get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota rather than its destruction and I would submit that this idea does this so let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way besides some you know entertaining insights about about human desire as an intellectual matter looking at the world from other species points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly which is intellection this is in the realm of intellectual history which is that we had this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago mini-me we have this intellectual referal this Darwinian revolution in which thanks to Darwin we figured out we are just one species among many evolutions working on us the same way it's working on all the others we are acted upon as well as acting we are really in the fiber of the fabric of life but the weird thing is we don't we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later none of us really believes this we are still Cartesians the children of Descartes who believe that subjectivity consciousness sets us apart that the world is divided into subjects and objects that there is nature on one side culture on another as soon as you start seeing things from the plan's point of view or the animals point of view you realize that the real literary conceit is that is this the idea that nature is opposed to culture the idea that that that consciousness is everything and that's another very important thing it does looking at the world from other species points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance you suddenly realize that consciousness which we value and we consider the you know the crown of the crowning achievement of nature human consciousness is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world and it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool but you know there's a comedian who said well who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important well consciousness so when you look at the plants you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting I'll give you two examples also from the garden lima beans you know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mic that comes in and attacks the spider mite defending the lima bean so what plants have while we have consciousness tool-making language they have biochemistry and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond can imagine and their complexity their sophistication is something to really marvel at and I think it's really the scandal of the human genome project you know we went into it thinking forty or fifty thousand human genes we came out with the only twenty three thousand just to give you a grounds for comparison rice 35,000 genes so who's the more sophisticated species well we're all equally sophisticated we've been involving evolving just as long just along different paths so cure for self-importance weight of sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea and that's really what I do as a writer as a storyteller is try to make people kind of feel what we know and tell stories that actually make us help us think ecologically now the other use of this is practical and I'm in tucked I'm going to take you to a farm right now as I use this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned in fact is that we are all now being manipulated by corn and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today to me is the final triumph of corn over good sense it is part of corns corn scheme for world domination and you will see the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us so but let me so it helped me understand industrial agriculture which of course is a Cartesian system it's based on this idea that we Bend other species to our will and that we are in charge and then we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want let me take you to a very different kind of farm this is farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species point of view are actually implemented and I found it in a man the farmers name is Joel Salatin and I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature and that is this the farm is called Polyface which means the idea is he's got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement it's permaculture those of you know a little bit about this such that the cows and the pigs and the em and the sheep and the turkeys and the what else what else does he have all the six different species rabbits actually are all performing ecological services for one another such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another and I can't it's a very elaborate and beautiful dance but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens his laying hens and I'll show you how if you take this approach what you get okay and this is a lot more than growing food as you'll see this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion that the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning and that for us to get what we want nature is diminished so one day cattle in a pen the only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing relatively new up to a car battery even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock set it up in 15 minutes cows graze one day they move okay they graze everything down intensive intensive grazing he waits three days and then we towed in something called the egg mobile the egg mobile is a very rickety contraption it looks like a Prairie schooner made out of boards but it houses 350 chickens he tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank turns them down and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank clucking gossiping as chickens will and they make a beeline for the cow patties and what they're doing is very interesting they're digging through the cow patties for the maggots the grub the larvae of flies and the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens favorite form of protein so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and there they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs and in the process they're spreading the manure out very useful at second echo system service and third while they're in this paddock there are of course defecating madly and and they're very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field they then move out to the next one and in the course of just a few weeks the grass just enters his blaze of growth and within four or five weeks he can do it again he can graze again you can cut they could bring in another species like the Lambs or he can um make hay for the winter now I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there so it's a very productive system and what I need to tell you is that on a hundred acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef 30,000 pounds of pork 25,000 dozen eggs 20,000 boilers a thousand turkeys a thousand rabbits an immense amount of food you know you here can organic feed the world well look how much food can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of again give each species what it want let it really realize its desires its physiological distinctiveness put that in play but look at it from the point of view of the grass now what happens to the grass when you do this when a ruminant grazes grass the grass is cut from this height to this height and it immediately does something very interesting anyone of you who Gardens knows that there is something called the root shoot ratio and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots they kind of cauterize them and the roots die and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots decomposing them the earthworms the fungi the bacteria and the result is new soil this is how soil is created it's created from the bottom up this is how the prairies were built the relationship between bison and grasses and what I realized when I understood this and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer he's not a sheep farmer he's not a cattle rancher he's a grass farmer because grass is

account of other species take account of the soil that even with with enough more than this perspectival idea because there is no technology involved here except for those fences which could be you know they're so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time that you can we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process this this is a way to reanimate the world and that's what's so exciting about this perspective when we really begin to feel darwin's insights in our bones the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very helpful about thank you very much

use of this is practical and I'm in tucked I'm going to take you to a farm right now as I use this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned in fact is that we are all now being manipulated by corn and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today to me is the final triumph of corn over good sense it is part of corns corn scheme for world domination and you will see the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us so but let me so it helped me understand industrial agriculture which of course is a Cartesian system it's based on this idea that we Bend other species to our will and that we are in charge and then we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want let me take you to a very different kind of farm this is farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species point of view are actually implemented and I found it in a man the farmers name is Joel Salatin and I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature and that is this the farm is called Polyface which means the idea is he's got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement it's permaculture those of you know a little bit about this such that the cows and the pigs and the em and the sheep and the turkeys and the what else what else does he have all the six different species rabbits actually are all performing ecological services for one another such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another and I can't it's a very elaborate and beautiful dance but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens his laying hens and I'll show you how if you take this approach what you get okay and this is a lot more than growing food as you'll see this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion that the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning and that for us to get what we want nature is diminished so one day cattle in a pen the only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing relatively new up to a car battery even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock set it up in 15 minutes cows graze one day they move okay they graze everything down intensive intensive grazing he waits three days and then we towed in something called the egg mobile the egg mobile is a very rickety contraption it looks like a Prairie schooner made out of boards but it houses 350 chickens he tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank turns them down and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank clucking gossiping as chickens will and they make a beeline for the cow patties and what they're doing is very interesting they're digging through the cow patties for the maggots the grub the larvae of flies and the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens favorite form of protein so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and there they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs and in the process they're spreading the manure out very useful at second echo system service and third while they're in this paddock there are of course defecating madly and and they're very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field they then move out to the next one and in the course of just a few weeks the grass just enters his blaze of growth and within four or five weeks he can do it again he can graze again you can cut they could bring in another species like the Lambs or he can um make hay for the winter now I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there so it's a very productive system and what I need to tell you is that on a hundred acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef 30,000 pounds of pork 25,000 dozen eggs 20,000 boilers a thousand turkeys a thousand rabbits an immense amount of food you know you here can organic feed the world well look how much food can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of again give each species what it want let it really realize its desires its physiological distinctiveness put that in play but look at it from the point of view of the grass now what happens to the grass when you do this when a ruminant grazes grass the grass is cut from this height to this height and it immediately does something very interesting anyone of you who Gardens knows that there is something called the root shoot ratio and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots they kind of cauterize them and the roots die and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots decomposing them the earthworms the fungi the bacteria and the result is new soil this is how soil is created it's created from the bottom up this is how the prairies were built the relationship between bison and grasses and what I realized when I understood this and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer he's not a sheep farmer he's not a cattle rancher he's a grass farmer because grass is really the keystone species of such a system is that if you think about it this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads which is that for us to get what we want nature is diminished more for us less for nature here all this food comes off this farm and at the end of the season there is actually more soil more fertility and more biodiversity it's a remarkably hopeful thing to do there are a lot of farmers doing this today this is well beyond organic agriculture which is still a Cartesian system more or less and what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species take account of the soil that even with with enough more than this perspectival idea because there is no technology involved here except for those fences which could be you know they're so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time that you can we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process this this is a way to reanimate the world and that's what's so exciting about this perspective when we really begin to feel darwin's insights in our bones the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very helpful about thank you very much

[Music] [Applause] we're going to go on a dive to the deep sea and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity knows that for the about two and a half hours on the way down it's a perfectly positively pitch black world and we used to see the most mysterious animals out there window that you couldn't describe these blinking lights a world of bioluminescence like fireflies Dr Edith Witter she's now at the ocean research and Conservation Association was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals and that's what you're seeing here on the screen that's all bioluminescence like I said just like fireflies there's a flying turkey under turkey I don't I yeah I I'm I'm a geologist by training uh but I love that uh and you see some of the some of the luminescence they used to avoid being eaten some they used to attract prey but all of it from an artistic point of view is just positively amazing and a lot of what goes on inside there's a fish with glowing eyes pulsating eyes some some of the colors are designed to hypnotize these lovely patterns and then this last one one of my favorites this pin wheel design just absolutely amazing every single dive that's the unknown world and today we've only explored about 3% 3% of what's out there in the ocean already we found the world's highest mountains world's deepest valleys underwater Lakes underwater waterfalls a lot of that we shared with you from the stage and in a place where we thought no life at all we find more life we think and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest which tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all there's still 97% and either that 97% is empty or just full of surprises but I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing the seapods head foots as a kid I knew them as calamari mostly but this is an octopus this is a work of Dr Roger hanin at the Marine biological lab and just fascinating how how seop pods can with their eyes incredible eyes sense their surrounding look at light look at patterns here's an octopus moving across the reef finds a spot to settle down curls up and then disappears into the background tough thing to do in the next bit we're going to see a couple of squid These Are squid now males when they fight if they're really aggressive they turn white and these two males are fighting they do it by bouncing their butts together which is an interesting concept now here's a male on the left and a female on the right and now the male has managed to split his color coloration so the female only always sees the Kinder gentler squid in him and the M's on the we're going to see it again let's take a look at it again watch the coloration white on the right Brown on the left he takes a step back so he's keeping off the other males by splitting his body and he comes up on the other side Bingo now I'm told that's not just a squid phenomena with males but I I know that's cuttlefish I love cuttlefish this is a giant Australian cuttlefish and there he is his droopy little eyes up here but they could do pretty amazing things too here we're going to see one backing into uh crevice and and watch his watch his tentacles he just pulls them in makes them look just like algae disappears right into the background positively amazing here's two males fighting once again they're they're smart enough these seapods they know not to hurt each other but look at the patterns that they can do with their skin okay just an amazing thing here's an octopus sometimes they don't want to be seen when they move because Predators can see them and here this is this guy actually can make himself look like a rock and looking at this environment can actually slide across the bottom using the waves in the shadows so he can't be seen he does he Blends right into the his motion Blends right into the background the moving rock trick so we're learning Lots new from the shallow water still exploring that deep learning Lots from the shallow water there's a good reason why I mean the shallow water is full of predators here's a barracuda and if you're an octopus or a seapod you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide in the next scene you're going to see nice Coral bottom and you'd see that an octopus would stand out very easily there if you couldn't use your camouflage use your skin to change color and texture here's some LGA in the ground and an octopus isn't that amazing now Roger spooked him so it's he took off cloud of ink lands and when he lands the octopus says I've been seen best thing to do is get as big as I can get that big brown makes his eye spot very big so he's bluffing let's do it backwards I thought he was joking when he first showed it to me I thought it was all Graphics so here here it is in Reverse watch the skin color watch the skin texture just an amazing animal change color and texture to

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Take a look outside a window. What is the season where you are? How do you know? Most likely, you looked at a tree or plant and noticed details about its leaves and assessed the qualities of sunlight streaming outside. Observing the timing of biological events in relation to changes in season and climate is called "phenology". When you notice the daffodil buds are poking through the snow and think spring is on its way, you're using phenology. When you see leaves turn from green to red, and watch migrating birds fly past, and realize that summer is over, autumn is here, you're using phenology. Literally meaning, "the science of appearance", phenology comes from the Greek words "pheno," to show or appear, and "logos," to study. Humans have relied on phenology since the time of hunters and gatherers. We've watched changes in seasons to know when to plant and harvest food and when to track migrating animals. Scientists observe and document seasonal changes in nature and look for patterns in the timing of seasonal events. Timing of these natural signs has remained consistent until recently. Increasing global temperature is causing rhythms of nature to shift. Bud burst, the day when a tree or plant's leaf or flower buds open, is occurring earlier in the year for some species. For every one degree Celsius rise in temperature, bud burst happens five days earlier than usual. Differences in timing affect not only plants, but the insects and birds that depend on the plants for food. For example, oak trees in the Arnhem Forest of the Netherlands now experience bud burst ten days earlier, as compared to twenty years ago. New oak leaves are a favorite food of winter moth caterpillars. To survive, the caterpillars adapted to the change in the tree's timing, and now hatch 15 days earlier than before. Migrating pied flycatcher birds, however, aren't doing as well. The birds prefer to feed their chicks winter moth caterpillars. The caterpillars are now hatching earlier, but the birds' chicks are not. This delay is costing the birds a food source. The pied flycatcher population has decreased by up to 90% in some areas as a result. Changes to a seemingly simple event, leaves opening, has ripple effects throughout a food web. Earlier bloom times can also have an economic impact. The famed cherry blossoms in Washington D.C. are blooming five days earlier than before. Since the cherry trees are blooming earlier, the blossoms also fade earlier, frustrating thousands of tourists who visit for the Cherry Blossom Festival. High school marching bands plan all year to attend the parade and perform, surrounded by a majestic white canopy. How disappointing for them to find, well, trees rather than the famous cherry blossoms! Plants and animals react to changes in natural light and temperature. Increasing temperatures cause plants to bloom earlier than before, and become out of sync with the insects and birds in a food web. So, the next time you look out your window and notice what season it is, you may be fooled by those blooming trees. Think of phenology, then think of how you can play a part to slow climate change.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Right now, trillions of chemical reactions are humming away in the cells of your body. You never feel them, but without these reactions, you wouldn't be alive. Unfortunately, each of those reactions needs some help. You see, most molecules are stable, they are happy just the way they are. The atoms in them are all bound-up and friendly with one another and would prefer to stay that way. The problem is, for a chemical reaction to happen, the atoms that make up those stable molecules need to break away from their friends and go buddy up with another atom. This break-up is where the molecules need a hand. This initial kick-start is known as activation energy. It's used to destabilize the molecule, to push the bonds between the atoms to a place where they are ready to break. This unstable state is known as the molecule's transition state. Once a transition state has been achieved, the atoms become willing to leave their current molecular friends and go make new friends elsewhere. Once they are convinced, it's a piece of cake. Bonds break, atoms rearrange, and the rest of the reaction happens automatically. After that first push, the body doesn't need to put in any more energy to help the reaction along. Left alone, most of these reactions would be very slow because it takes quite a while to build up the activation energy the molecules need to get started. Enter the enzyme. Enzymes are proteins that speed up, or catalyze, reactions by lowering the activation energy. They make it easier for the molecule, also known as a substrate, to get to the transition state. You can think of a reaction like a race. Some racers are running along, while others have teammates to help them. Meet Sam the Substrate. His team is the MODS Squad. Together, his team is able to get to the finish faster, using less energy. There are four special enzymes in Sam's team. Each has a different strategy for lowering the energy it takes to get going and speeding up the pace to get the MODS to the finish line. The "M" stands for "microenvironment". This enzyme creates a tiny, special environment for the substrate, resulting in a faster reaction time. He runs ahead of the pack, flattening out bumps in the road and misting cool water on his team of molecules. "O" is for "orientation". Sometimes two molecules must be positioned just right before they will react. Like a friend at the finish line, the O enzyme provides his molecules with specially shaped spaces that allow the substrates to interact in just the right way. "D" stands for "direct participation". Every now and again, a little muscle is needed. And when his teammates are struggling to finish the race, Teammate D is there to pick them up and carry them over the line. Finally, "S" is for "straining bonds". This guy pushes the team through some serious flexibility exercises: splits, lunges, backbends, the works. Sometimes his substrate teammates just need to be stressed and flexed into their transition state. So that's it. Remember that all reactions need energy to get going. This energy is known as the activation energy. Enzymes lower that activation energy and speed the reaction through team MODS: microenvironment, orientation, direct participation, and straining bonds.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You might have heard that light is a kind of wave and that the color of an object is related to the frequency of light waves it reflects. High-frequency light waves look violet, low-frequency light waves look red, and in-between frequencies look yellow, green, orange, and so on. You might call this idea physical color because it says that color is a physical property of light itself. It's not dependent on human perception. And, while this isn't wrong, it isn't quite the whole story either. For instance, you might have seen this picture before. As you can see, the region where the red and green lights overlap is yellow. When you think about it, this is pretty weird. Because light is a wave, two different frequencies shouldn't interact with each other at all, they should just co-exist like singers singing in harmony. So, in this yellow looking region, two different kinds of light waves are present: one with a red frequency, and one with a green frequency. There is no yellow light present at all. So, how come this region, where the red and green lights mix, looks yellow to us? To understand this, you have to understand a little bit about biology, in particular, about how humans see color. Light perception happens in a paper-thin layer of cells, called the retina, that covers the back of your eyeball. In the retina, there are two different types of light-detecting cells: rods and cones. The rods are used for seeing in low-light conditions, and there is only one kind of those. The cones, however, are a different story. There three kinds of cone cells that roughly correspond to the colors red, green, and blue. When you see a color, each cone sends its own distinct signal to your brain. For example, suppose that yellow light, that is real yellow light, with a yellow frequency, is shining on your eye. You don't have a cone specifically for detecting yellow, but yellow is kind of close to green and also kind of close to red, so both the red and green cones get activated, and each sends a signal to your brain saying so. Of course, there is another way to activate the red cones and the green cones simultaneously: if both red light and green light are present at the same time. The point is, your brain receives the same signal, regardless of whether you see light that has the yellow frequency or light that is a mixture of the green and red frequencies. That's why, for light, red plus green equals yellow. And, how come you can't detect colors when it's dark? Well, the rod cells in your retina take over in low-light conditions. You only have one kind of rod cell, and so there is one type of signal that can get sent to your brain: light or no light. Having only one kind of light detector doesn't leave any room for seeing color. There are infinitely many different physical colors, but, because we only have three kinds of cones, the brain can be tricked into thinking it's seeing any color by carefully adding together the right combination of just three colors: red, green, and blue. This property of human vision is really useful in the real world. For example, TV manufacturing. Instead of having to put infinitely many colors in your TV set to simulate the real world, TV manufacturers only have to put three: red, green, and blue, which is lucky for them, really.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Being human, we each view ourselves as a unique and independent individual, but we're never alone! Millions of microscopic beings inhabit our bodies, and no two bodies are the same. Each is a different habitat for microbial communities: from the arid deserts of our skin, to the villages on our lips, and the cities in our mouths. Even every tooth is its own distinctive neighborhood, and our guts are teaming metropolises of interacting microbes. And in these bustling streets of our guts, we see a constant influx of food, and every microbe has a job to do. Here's a cellulolytic bacteria, for example. Their one job is to break down cellulose, a common compound in vegetables, into sugars. Those simple sugars then move along to the respirators, another set of microbes that snatch up these simple sugars and burn them as fuel. As food travels through our digestive tract, it reaches the fermentors who extract energy from these sugars by converting them into chemicals, like alcohol and hydrogen gas, which they spew out as waste products. Deeper in the depths of our gut city, the syntrophs eke out a living off the fermenters' trash. At each step of this process, energy is released, and that energy is absorbed by the cells of the digestive tract. This city we just saw is different in everyone. Every person has a unique and diverse community of gut microbes that can process food in different ways. One person's gut microbes may be capable of releasing only a fraction of the calories that another person's gut microbes can extract. So, what determines the membership of our gut microbial community? Well, things like our genetic makeup and the microbes we encounter throughout our lives can contribute to our microbial ecosystems. The food we eat also influences which microbes live in our gut. For example, food made of complex molecules, like an apple, requires a lot of different microbial workers to break it down. But, if a food is made of simple molecules, like a lollipop, some of these workers are put out of a job. Those workers leave the city, never to return. What doesn't function well are gut microbial communities with only a few different types of workers. For example, humans who suffer from diseases like diabetes or chronic gut inflamation typically have less microbial variety in their guts. We don't fully understand the best way to manage our individual microbial societies, but it is likely that lifestyle changes, such as eating a varied diet of complex, plant-based foods, can help revitalize our microbial ecosystems in our gut and across the entire landscape of our body. So, we are really not alone in our body. Our bodies are homes to millions of different microbes, and we need them just as much as they need us. As we learn more about how our microbes interact with each other and with our bodies, we will reveal how we can nurture this complex, invisible world that shapes our personal identity, our health, and our well-being.
