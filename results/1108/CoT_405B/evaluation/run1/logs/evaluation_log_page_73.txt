**Transcript**:
Probability is an area of mathematics
that is everywhere. We hear about it in weather forecasts, like there's an 80% chance
of snow tomorrow. It's used in making predictions in sports, such as determining the odds
for who will win the Super Bowl. Probability is also used in helping
to set auto insurance rates and it's what keeps casinos
and lotteries in business. How can probability affect you? Let's look at a simple
probability problem. Does it pay to randomly guess
on all 10 questions on a true/ false quiz? In other words,
if you were to toss a fair coin 10 times, and use it
to choose the answers, what is the probability
you would get a perfect score? It seems simple enough. There are only two
possible outcomes for each question. But with a 10-question true/ false quiz, there are lots of possible ways
to write down different combinations of Ts and Fs. To understand
how many different combinations, let's think about a much smaller
true/ false quiz with only two questions.
You could answer "true true," or "false false,"
or one of each. First "false" then "true,"
or first "true" then "false." So that's four different ways to write
the answers for a two-question quiz. What about a 10-question quiz? Well, this time, there are too many
to count and list by hand. In order to answer this question, we need
to know the fundamental counting principle. The fundamental counting principle states that if there are A possible outcomes
for one event, and B possible outcomes for another event, then there are A times B ways
to pair the outcomes. Clearly this works
for a two-question true/ false quiz. There are two different answers
you could write for the first question, and two different answers you could
write for the second question. That makes 2 times 2, or, 4 different ways
to write the answers for a two-question quiz. Now let's consider the 10-question quiz. To do this, we just need to extend
the fundamental counting principle a bit. We need to realize that there are two
possible answers for each of the 10 questions. So the number of possible outcomes is 2, times 2, times 2, times 2,
times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2. Or, a shorter way to say
that is 2 to the 10th power, which is equal to 1,024. That means of all the ways
you could write down your Ts and Fs, only one of the 1,024 ways would match
the teacher's answer key perfectly. So the probability of you getting
a perfect score by guessing is only 1 out of 1,024, or about a 10th of a percent. Clearly, guessing isn't a good idea. In fact, what would be
the most common score if you and all your friends
were to always randomly guess at every question on
a 10-question true/ false quiz? Well, not everyone would get
exactly 5 out of 10. But the average score, in the long run, would be 5. In a situation like this,
there are two possible outcomes: a question is right or wrong, and the probability
of being right by guessing is always the same: 1/2. To find the average number
you would get right by guessing, you multiply the number of questions by the probability
of getting the question right. Here, that is 10 times 1/2, or 5. Hopefully you study for quizzes, since it clearly doesn't pay to guess. But at one point, you probably took
a standardized test like the SAT, and most people have to guess
on a few questions. If there are 20 questions
and five possible answers for each question, what is the probability
you would get all 20 right by randomly guessing? And what should you expect
your score to be? Let's use the ideas from before. First, since the probability of getting
a question right by guessing is 1/5, we would expect to get 1/5
of the 20 questions right. Yikes - that's only four questions! Are you thinking that the probability
of getting all 20 questions correct is pretty small? Let's find out just how small. Do you recall the fundamental
counting principle that was stated before? With five possible outcomes
for each question, we would multiply 5 times 5
times 5 times 5 times... Well, we would just use 5 as a factor 20 times, and 5 to the 20th power is 95 trillion, 365 billion, 431 million, 648 thousand, 625.
Wow - that's huge! So the probability of getting all questions
correct by randomly guessing is about 1 in 95 trillion.

that is 2 to the 10th power, which is equal to 1,024. That means of all the ways
you could write down your Ts and Fs, only one of the 1,024 ways would match
the teacher's answer key perfectly. So the probability of you getting
a perfect score by guessing is only 1 out of 1,024, or about a 10th of a percent. Clearly, guessing isn't a good idea. In fact, what would be
the most common score if you and all your friends
were to always randomly guess at every question on
a 10-question true/ false quiz? Well, not everyone would get
exactly 5 out of 10. But the average score, in the long run, would be 5. In a situation like this,
there are two possible outcomes: a question is right or wrong, and the probability
of being right by guessing is always the same: 1/2. To find the average number
you would get right by guessing, you multiply the number of questions by the probability
of getting the question right. Here, that is 10 times 1/2, or 5. Hopefully you study for quizzes, since it clearly doesn't pay to guess. But at one point, you probably took
a standardized test like the SAT, and most people have to guess
on a few questions. If there are 20 questions
and five possible answers for each question, what is the probability
you would get all 20 right by randomly guessing? And what should you expect
your score to be? Let's use the ideas from before. First, since the probability of getting
a question right by guessing is 1/5, we would expect to get 1/5
of the 20 questions right. Yikes - that's only four questions! Are you thinking that the probability
of getting all 20 questions correct is pretty small? Let's find out just how small. Do you recall the fundamental
counting principle that was stated before? With five possible outcomes
for each question, we would multiply 5 times 5
times 5 times 5 times... Well, we would just use 5 as a factor 20 times, and 5 to the 20th power is 95 trillion, 365 billion, 431 million, 648 thousand, 625.
Wow - that's huge! So the probability of getting all questions
correct by randomly guessing is about 1 in 95 trillion.

**Transcript**:
Probability is an area of mathematics
that is everywhere. We hear about it in weather forecasts, like there's an 80% chance
of snow tomorrow. It's used in making predictions in sports, such as determining the odds
for who will win the Super Bowl. Probability is also used in helping
to set auto insurance rates and it's what keeps casinos
and lotteries in business. How can probability affect you? Let's look at a simple
probability problem. Does it pay to randomly guess
on all 10 questions on a true/ false quiz? In other words,
if you were to toss a fair coin 10 times, and use it
to choose the answers, what is the probability
you would get a perfect score? It seems simple enough. There are only two
possible outcomes for each question. But with a 10-question true/ false quiz, there are lots of possible ways
to write down different combinations of Ts and Fs. To understand
how many different combinations, let's think about a much smaller
true/ false quiz with only two questions.
You could answer "true true," or "false false,"
or one of each. First "false" then "true,"
or first "true" then "false." So that's four different ways to write
the answers for a two-question quiz. What about a 10-question quiz? Well, this time, there are too many
to count and list by hand. In order to answer this question, we need
to know the fundamental counting principle. The fundamental counting principle states that if there are A possible outcomes
for one event, and B possible outcomes for another event, then there are A times B ways
to pair the outcomes. Clearly this works
for a two-question true/ false quiz. There are two different answers
you could write for the first question, and two different answers you could
write for the second question. That makes 2 times 2, or, 4 different ways
to write the answers for a two-question quiz. Now let's consider the 10-question quiz. To do this, we just need to extend
the fundamental counting principle a bit. We need to realize that there are two
possible answers for each of the 10 questions. So the number of possible outcomes is 2, times 2, times 2, times 2,
times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2. Or, a shorter way to say
that is 2 to the 10th power, which is equal to 1,024. That means of all the ways
you could write down your Ts and Fs, only one of the 1,024 ways would match
the teacher's answer key perfectly. So the probability of you getting
a perfect score by guessing is only 1 out of 1,024, or about a 10th of a percent. Clearly, guessing isn't a good idea. In fact, what would be
the most common score if you and all your friends
were to always randomly guess at every question on
a 10-question true/ false quiz? Well, not everyone would get
exactly 5 out of 10. But the average score, in the long run, would be 5. In a situation like this,
there are two possible outcomes: a question is right or wrong, and the probability
of being right by guessing is always the same: 1/2. To find the average number
you would get right by guessing, you multiply the number of questions by the probability
of getting the question right. Here, that is 10 times 1/2, or 5. Hopefully you study for quizzes, since it clearly doesn't pay to guess. But at one point, you probably took
a standardized test like the SAT, and most people have to guess
on a few questions. If there are 20 questions
and five possible answers for each question, what is the probability
you would get all 20 right by randomly guessing? And what should you expect
your score to be? Let's use the ideas from before. First, since the probability of getting
a question right by guessing is 1/5, we would expect to get 1/5
of the 20 questions right. Yikes - that's only four questions! Are you thinking that the probability
of getting all 20 questions correct is pretty small? Let's find out just how small. Do you recall the fundamental
counting principle that was stated before? With five possible outcomes

times 5 times 5 times... Well, we would just use 5 as a factor 20 times, and 5 to the 20th power is 95 trillion, 365 billion, 431 million, 648 thousand, 625.
Wow - that's huge! So the probability of getting all questions
correct by randomly guessing is about 1 in 95 trillion.

**Transcript**:
Every day we are bombarded on all platforms of media with personal stories that span the continuum from the embarrassing and the trivial to the dire and the critical. The foodie posting photos of every plate of lasagna he orders, the Iranian blogger describing the shooting death of Nedā Āghā-Soltān. Authentic narrative is the glue that connects people, providing a compelling reason to keep reading. It makes the personal universal, transcends the individual, and makes a story timeless and humanistic. How, as a journalist, do you ask the questions that yield this type of narrative? You have to know what to ask of whom. First you need to understand that every piece of journalism requires a trifecta of sourcing. If you picture the reporting process as depicted by a triangle, one side will be official sources, another side will be overview sources, and a third side will be unofficial sources. All three components are necessary in every well-reported piece. The first side has official sources. Those are the people with titles and expertise, who own the company; are spokespeople for the movement. They tell you the numbers, and the answers to how much, how many, where, when, and who. A second side of the triangle includes overview sources: academics, consultants, authors, who are not directly connected as stakeholders, but have knowledge of the big picture. Yet it is the third side of the trifecta - unofficial sources - who hold the power of the individual's insight. This is where you can find the why, Giving consequence on the event, trend, phase, or idea and what it means on a soul level to someone affected by it. So how do you mine for the gems, identifying what is compelling from what is chatter? You ask surprising questions. To achieve the complicated, fragile human connection, you regard the stories of every subject as sacred. Realize that an anecdote is oxygen that breathes life into a grey story of exposition, facts and data. What the surgeon did at home the morning he operated on a woman's brain tumor. How it feels to dream and train for the Olympics for a lifetime. There are times when it is important to convey information quickly, to present bulleted facts and updates. When a situation is urgent, when action is required now, when you need to know where the tornado will hit, how fast the fire is spreading, and if it will reach your home today. But the narrative personal stories that contribute to the buffet of journalism are pieces that have the luxury of a slow dance of information. It is this artful solicitation of story that will make the journalism memorable and will deliver the narrative bond that will connect us to each other.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the ground truth MCQ is focused on the statement that "Personal narrative is a new form of storytelling in 21st century media employed only in personal blogs and conversations," which is not directly addressed in the generated MCQs, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of the topic of narrative storytelling.

The closest generated MCQ is Question 6, but it's not a perfect match.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the concept of personal narrative, its importance, and its application in media.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, but with a low confidence level.

**Transcript**:
Every day we are bombarded on all platforms of media with personal stories that span the continuum from the embarrassing and the trivial to the dire and the critical. The foodie posting photos of every plate of lasagna he orders, the Iranian blogger describing the shooting death of Nedā Āghā-Soltān. Authentic narrative is the glue that connects people, providing a compelling reason to keep reading. It makes the personal universal, transcends the individual, and makes a story timeless and humanistic. How, as a journalist, do you ask the questions that yield this type of narrative? You have to know what to ask of whom. First you need to understand that every piece of journalism requires a trifecta of sourcing. If you picture the reporting process as depicted by a triangle, one side will be official sources, another side will be overview sources, and a third side will be unofficial sources. All three components are necessary in every well-reported piece. The first side has official sources. Those are the people with titles and expertise, who own the company; are spokespeople for the movement. They tell you the numbers, and the answers to how much, how many, where, when, and who. A second side of the triangle includes overview sources: academics, consultants, authors, who are not directly connected as stakeholders, but have knowledge of the big picture. Yet it is the third side of the trifecta - unofficial sources - who hold the power of the individual's insight. This is where you can find the why, Giving consequence on the event, trend, phase, or idea and what it means on a soul level to someone affected by it. So how do you mine for the gems, identifying what is compelling from what is chatter? You ask surprising questions. To achieve the complicated, fragile human connection, you regard the stories of every subject as sacred. Realize that an anecdote is oxygen that breathes life into a grey story of exposition, facts and data. What the surgeon did at home the morning he operated on a woman's brain tumor. How it feels to dream and train for the Olympics for a lifetime. There are times when it is important to convey information quickly, to present bulleted facts and updates. When a situation is urgent, when action is required now, when you need to know where the tornado will hit, how fast the fire is spreading, and if it will reach your home today. But the narrative personal stories that contribute to the buffet of journalism are pieces that have the luxury of a slow dance of information. It is this artful solicitation of story that will make the journalism memorable and will deliver the narrative bond that will connect us to each other.

**Transcript**:
Emily Dickinson said over a century ago that "There is no frigate
like a book to take us lands away ..." And it's true. When we pick up a book,
turn on the TV, or watch a movie, we're carried away down the currents
of story into a world of imagination. And when we land, on a shore
that is both new and familiar, something strange happens. Stepping onto the shore, we're changed. We don't retrace
the footsteps of the authors or characters we followed here. No; instead, we walk a mile
in their shoes. Researchers in psychology, neuroscience,
child development and biology are finally starting to gain
quantifiable scientific evidence, showing what writers and readers
have always known: that stories have a unique ability
to change a person's point of view. Scholars are discovering evidence
that stories shape culture, and that much of what we believe
about life comes not from fact, but from fiction - that our ideas of class, marriage
and even gender are relatively new, and that many ideologies
which held fast for centuries were revised within the 18th century, and redrafted in the pages
of the early novel. Imagine a world where class,
and not hard work, decides a person's worth; a world where women
are simply men's more untamed copy; a world where marriage for love
is a novel notion. Well, that was the world
in which Samuel Richardson's "Pamela" first appeared. Richardson's love story
starred a poor, serving-class heroine, who is both more superior and smarter
than her upper-class suitor. The book, challenging
a slew of traditions, caused quite a ruckus. There was more press for "Pamela"
than for Parliament. It spawned intense debate
and several counter-novels. Still, for all those
who couldn't accept "Pamela," others were eager
for this new fictional world. This best seller
and all its literary heirs - "Pride and Prejudice,"
"Jane Eyre," and yes, even "Twilight" - have continuously shared the same tale
and taught similar lessons, which are now conventional
and commonplace. Similarly, novels have helped
shape the minds of thought leaders across history. Some scholars say
that Darwin's theory of evolution is highly indebted to the plots
he read and loved. His theory privileges intelligence,
swiftness, and adaptability to change - all core characteristics in a hero. Whether you're reading
"Harry Potter" or "Great Expectations," you're reading the kind of plot
that inspired Darwin. Yet, recent studies show that his theory
might not be the whole story. Our sense of being a hero -
one man or one woman or even one species
taking on the challenges of the world - might be wrong. Instead of being hardwired for competition for being the solitary heroes
in our own story, we might instead be members
of a shared quest. More Hobbit than Harry. Sometimes, of course,
the shoes we've been walking in can get plain worn out. After all, we haven't walked just one mile in Jane Austen's or Mark Twain's shoes - we've walked about
100 trillion miles in them. This isn't to say that we can't
read and enjoy the classics; we should travel with Dickens, let Pip teach us
what to expect from ourselves, have a talk with Austen and Elizabeth
about our prides and prejudices. We should float with Twain
down the Mississippi, and have Jim show us
what it means to be good. But on our journey,
we should also keep in mind that the terrain has changed. We'll start shopping around for boots that were made for walking into a new era. Take, for instance, Katniss Everdeen
and her battle with the Capitol. Can "Hunger Games" lead us into thinking
about capitalism in a new way? Can it teach us a lesson about why the individual should not
put herself before the group? Will "Uglies" reflect the dangers
of pursuing a perfect body and letting the media
define what is beautiful? Will "Seekers" trod a path
beyond global warming? Will the life-and-death struggles
of Toklo, Kallik, Lusa and the other bears chart a course for understanding animals
and our place in their world? Only the future will tell which stories
will engage our imagination, which tales of make-believe
we'll make tomorrow. But the good news is this: there are new stories
to venture in every day, new tales that promise to influence,
to create and to spark change - stories that you might
even write yourself. So I guess the final question is this: What story will you try on next?

**Transcript**:
Emily Dickinson said over a century ago that "There is no frigate
like a book to take us lands away ..." And it's true. When we pick up a book,
turn on the TV, or watch a movie, we're carried away down the currents
of story into a world of imagination. And when we land, on a shore
that is both new and familiar, something strange happens. Stepping onto the shore, we're changed. We don't retrace
the footsteps of the authors or characters we followed here. No; instead, we walk a mile
in their shoes. Researchers in psychology, neuroscience,
child development and biology are finally starting to gain
quantifiable scientific evidence, showing what writers and readers
have always known: that stories have a unique ability
to change a person's point of view. Scholars are discovering evidence
that stories shape culture, and that much of what we believe
about life comes not from fact, but from fiction - that our ideas of class, marriage
and even gender are relatively new, and that many ideologies
which held fast for centuries were revised within the 18th century, and redrafted in the pages
of the early novel. Imagine a world where class,
and not hard work, decides a person's worth; a world where women
are simply men's more untamed copy; a world where marriage for love
is a novel notion. Well, that was the world
in which Samuel Richardson's "Pamela" first appeared. Richardson's love story
starred a poor, serving-class heroine, who is both more superior and smarter
than her upper-class suitor. The book, challenging
a slew of traditions, caused quite a ruckus. There was more press for "Pamela"
than for Parliament. It spawned intense debate
and several counter-novels. Still, for all those
who couldn't accept "Pamela," others were eager
for this new fictional world. This best seller
and all its literary heirs - "Pride and Prejudice,"
"Jane Eyre," and yes, even "Twilight" - have continuously shared the same tale
and taught similar lessons, which are now conventional
and commonplace. Similarly, novels have helped
shape the minds of thought leaders across history. Some scholars say
that Darwin's theory of evolution is highly indebted to the plots
he read and loved. His theory privileges intelligence,
swiftness, and adaptability to change - all core characteristics in a hero. Whether you're reading
"Harry Potter" or "Great Expectations," you're reading the kind of plot
that inspired Darwin. Yet, recent studies show that his theory
might not be the whole story. Our sense of being a hero -
one man or one woman or even one species
taking on the challenges of the world - might be wrong. Instead of being hardwired for competition for being the solitary heroes
in our own story, we might instead be members
of a shared quest. More Hobbit than Harry. Sometimes, of course,
the shoes we've been walking in can get plain worn out. After all, we haven't walked just one mile in Jane Austen's or Mark Twain's shoes - we've walked about
100 trillion miles in them. This isn't to say that we can't
read and enjoy the classics; we should travel with Dickens, let Pip teach us
what to expect from ourselves, have a talk with Austen and Elizabeth
about our prides and prejudices. We should float with Twain
down the Mississippi, and have Jim show us
what it means to be good. But on our journey,
we should also keep in mind that the terrain has changed. We'll start shopping around for boots that were made for walking into a new era. Take, for instance, Katniss Everdeen
and her battle with the Capitol. Can "Hunger Games" lead us into thinking
about capitalism in a new way? Can it teach us a lesson about why the individual should not
put herself before the group? Will "Uglies" reflect the dangers
of pursuing a perfect body and letting the media
define what is beautiful? Will "Seekers" trod a path
beyond global warming? Will the life-and-death struggles
of Toklo, Kallik, Lusa and the other bears chart a course for understanding animals
and our place in their world? Only the future will tell which stories
will engage our imagination, which tales of make-believe
we'll make tomorrow. But the good news is this: there are new stories
to venture in every day, new tales that promise to influence,
to create and to spark change - stories that you might
even write yourself. So I guess the final question is this: What story will you try on next?

"Harry Potter" or "Great Expectations," you're reading the kind of plot
that inspired Darwin. Yet, recent studies show that his theory
might not be the whole story. Our sense of being a hero -
one man or one woman or even one species
taking on the challenges of the world - might be wrong. Instead of being hardwired for competition for being the solitary heroes
in our own story, we might instead be members
of a shared quest. More Hobbit than Harry. Sometimes, of course,
the shoes we've been walking in can get plain worn out. After all, we haven't walked just one mile in Jane Austen's or Mark Twain's shoes - we've walked about
100 trillion miles in them. This isn't to say that we can't
read and enjoy the classics; we should travel with Dickens, let Pip teach us
what to expect from ourselves, have a talk with Austen and Elizabeth
about our prides and prejudices. We should float with Twain
down the Mississippi, and have Jim show us
what it means to be good. But on our journey,
we should also keep in mind that the terrain has changed. We'll start shopping around for boots that were made for walking into a new era. Take, for instance, Katniss Everdeen
and her battle with the Capitol. Can "Hunger Games" lead us into thinking
about capitalism in a new way? Can it teach us a lesson about why the individual should not
put herself before the group? Will "Uglies" reflect the dangers
of pursuing a perfect body and letting the media
define what is beautiful? Will "Seekers" trod a path
beyond global warming? Will the life-and-death struggles
of Toklo, Kallik, Lusa and the other bears chart a course for understanding animals
and our place in their world? Only the future will tell which stories
will engage our imagination, which tales of make-believe
we'll make tomorrow. But the good news is this: there are new stories
to venture in every day, new tales that promise to influence,
to create and to spark change - stories that you might
even write yourself. So I guess the final question is this: What story will you try on next?

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
How does the difference between point 0000000398 and point 00000000398 cause one to have red eyes after swimming? To answer this, we first need a way of dealing with rather small numbers, or in some cases extremely large numbers. This leads us
to the concept of logarithms. Well, what are logarithms? Let's take the base number, b, and raise it to a power, p, like 2 to the 3rd power, and have it equal a number n. We get an exponential equation:
b raised to the p power, equals n. In our example, that'd be 2 raised to the 3rd power, equals 8. The exponent p is said to be the logarithm of the number n. Most of the time this would be written: "log, base b, of a number
equals p, the power." This is starting to sound a bit confusing
with all the variables, so let's show this with an example. What is the value of log base 10 of 10,000? The same question could be asked
using exponents: "10 raised to what power is 10,000?" Well, 10 to the 4th is 10,000. So, log base 10 of 10,000 must equal 4. This example can also be completed 
very simply on a scientific calculator. Log base 10 is used so frequently in the sciences that it has the honor of having
its own button on most calculators. If the calculator will figure out
logs for me, why study them? Just a quick reminder: the log button only computes
logarithms of base 10. What if you want to go into
computer science and need to understand base 2? So what is log base 2 of 64? In other words,
2 raised to what power is 64? Well, use your fingers.
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. So log base 2 of 64 must equal 6. So what does this have to do
with my eyes turning red in some swimming pools and not others? Well, it leads us into an interesting use of logarithms in chemistry: finding the pH of water samples. pH tells us how acidic
or basic a sample is, and can be calculated with the formula:  pH equals negative log base 10 of 
the hydrogen ion concentration, or H plus. We can find the pH of water samples with hydrogen ion concentration of 
point 0000000398 and point 00000000398 quickly on a calculator. Punch: negative log
of each of those numbers, and you'll see the pH's are 7.4 and 8.4. Since the tears in our eyes
have a pH of about 7.4, the H plus concentration of .0000000398 will feel nice on your eyes, but the pH of 8.4
will make you feel itchy and red. It's easy to remember logarithms
"log base b of some number n equals p" by repeating: "The base raised
to what power equals the number?" "The BASE raised to what POWER
equals the NUMBER?" So now we know
logarithms are very powerful when dealing with
extremely small or large numbers. Logarithms can even be used instead of eyedrops after swimming.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 5 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide an explanation for my choice. The ground truth MCQ asks about the power to which 10 must be raised to equal 10,000. Question 5 is about calculating the pH of a water sample, but it involves a similar concept of using logarithms to find the power.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the power to which a base must be raised to equal a certain number. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that Question 7 is a good match in terms of concept, but it does not have the same question intent as the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that there is a question mentioned in the transcript that matches the ground truth MCQ: "What is the value of log base 10 of 10,000? The same question could be asked using exponents: '10 raised to what power is 10,000?'" This question is not among the generated MCQs, but it is present in the transcript.

Given the available options, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but if I had to choose one, I would say it is Question 7, with the understanding that it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 7 (with the caveat that it's not an exact match)

**Transcript**:
How does the difference between point 0000000398 and point 00000000398 cause one to have red eyes after swimming? To answer this, we first need a way of dealing with rather small numbers, or in some cases extremely large numbers. This leads us
to the concept of logarithms. Well, what are logarithms? Let's take the base number, b, and raise it to a power, p, like 2 to the 3rd power, and have it equal a number n. We get an exponential equation:
b raised to the p power, equals n. In our example, that'd be 2 raised to the 3rd power, equals 8. The exponent p is said to be the logarithm of the number n. Most of the time this would be written: "log, base b, of a number
equals p, the power." This is starting to sound a bit confusing
with all the variables, so let's show this with an example. What is the value of log base 10 of 10,000? The same question could be asked
using exponents: "10 raised to what power is 10,000?" Well, 10 to the 4th is 10,000. So, log base 10 of 10,000 must equal 4. This example can also be completed 
very simply on a scientific calculator. Log base 10 is used so frequently in the sciences that it has the honor of having
its own button on most calculators. If the calculator will figure out
logs for me, why study them? Just a quick reminder: the log button only computes
logarithms of base 10. What if you want to go into
computer science and need to understand base 2? So what is log base 2 of 64? In other words,
2 raised to what power is 64? Well, use your fingers.
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. So log base 2 of 64 must equal 6. So what does this have to do
with my eyes turning red in some swimming pools and not others? Well, it leads us into an interesting use of logarithms in chemistry: finding the pH of water samples. pH tells us how acidic
or basic a sample is, and can be calculated with the formula:  pH equals negative log base 10 of 
the hydrogen ion concentration, or H plus. We can find the pH of water samples with hydrogen ion concentration of 
point 0000000398 and point 00000000398 quickly on a calculator. Punch: negative log
of each of those numbers, and you'll see the pH's are 7.4 and 8.4. Since the tears in our eyes
have a pH of about 7.4, the H plus concentration of .0000000398 will feel nice on your eyes, but the pH of 8.4
will make you feel itchy and red. It's easy to remember logarithms
"log base b of some number n equals p" by repeating: "The base raised
to what power equals the number?" "The BASE raised to what POWER
equals the NUMBER?" So now we know
logarithms are very powerful when dealing with
extremely small or large numbers. Logarithms can even be used instead of eyedrops after swimming.

We check the time every day, all day long. But did you ever wonder - where did telling time come from? Why does it matter what time it is? Who determined the clock and why in the world are there so many different time zones? The first form of telling time was the sundial and the earliest sundials known from the archaeological record are obelisks from nearly 5,000 years ago. Sundials indicate the time by casting a shadow onto a surface. The object that casts the shadow is a stick in the center known as a gnomon. A well-constructed sundial can measure time with remarkable accuracy, and sundials were used to monitor the performance of clocks until the modern era. But sundials have their limitations too. Obviously they require the sun to shine, so they don't work at all during the night when it's dark. Many different devices have been used over the years to estimate the passage of time: candles and sticks of incense that burn down at fairly predictable speeds have been used, along with the hourglass. Hourglasses are devices in which fine sand pours through a tiny hole at a constant rate and indicates a predetermined passage of an arbitrary period of time. The origin of the hourglass is uncertain, although beginning in the 14th century, the hourglass was used commonly, especially on board ships. The motion of the boat on the water did not affect the hourglass, unlike other time-measuring devices. The mechanical clock was invented in the 13th century which sparked a big change in traditional timekeeping methods. This modern clock relied on the swing of a pendulum or the vibration of a quartz crystal, which was far more accurate than sand or candles. Today, the basis for scientific time is a continuous count of seconds based on atomic clocks all around the world, known as the international atomic time. Why does it matter that we keep track of time? Well, time regulates our daily lives and makes it possible to accurately communicate with people all over the world. Without a time system, we would have many challenges in farming, social structures, communication, and business. Take the American railroad system, for example. In the mid-19th century, each railroad used its own standard time generally based on the local time of its headquarters, and the railroad's train schedules were published using its own time. Some major railroad junctions served by several different railroads had a separate clock for each railroad, each showing a different time. The distance between New York and Boston is about 2 degrees, or 8 minutes, which can be the difference between making or missing your train connection. If the difference between New York and Boston is 8 minutes, imagine the difference between Boston and Australia. The use of time zones irons out these differences and makes communication significantly smoother. A time zone is a region on earth that has a uniform standard time. There are 40 time zones on land because the earliest and latest time zones are 26 hours apart. Any given calendar date exists at some point on the globe for 50 hours. So the next time someone asks you "What time is it?" Your answer may be a whole lot more complicated than it used to be.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
We check the time every day, all day long. But did you ever wonder - where did telling time come from? Why does it matter what time it is? Who determined the clock and why in the world are there so many different time zones? The first form of telling time was the sundial and the earliest sundials known from the archaeological record are obelisks from nearly 5,000 years ago. Sundials indicate the time by casting a shadow onto a surface. The object that casts the shadow is a stick in the center known as a gnomon. A well-constructed sundial can measure time with remarkable accuracy, and sundials were used to monitor the performance of clocks until the modern era. But sundials have their limitations too. Obviously they require the sun to shine, so they don't work at all during the night when it's dark. Many different devices have been used over the years to estimate the passage of time: candles and sticks of incense that burn down at fairly predictable speeds have been used, along with the hourglass. Hourglasses are devices in which fine sand pours through a tiny hole at a constant rate and indicates a predetermined passage of an arbitrary period of time. The origin of the hourglass is uncertain, although beginning in the 14th century, the hourglass was used commonly, especially on board ships. The motion of the boat on the water did not affect the hourglass, unlike other time-measuring devices. The mechanical clock was invented in the 13th century which sparked a big change in traditional timekeeping methods. This modern clock relied on the swing of a pendulum or the vibration of a quartz crystal, which was far more accurate than sand or candles. Today, the basis for scientific time is a continuous count of seconds based on atomic clocks all around the world, known as the international atomic time. Why does it matter that we keep track of time? Well, time regulates our daily lives and makes it possible to accurately communicate with people all over the world. Without a time system, we would have many challenges in farming, social structures, communication, and business. Take the American railroad system, for example. In the mid-19th century, each railroad used its own standard time generally based on the local time of its headquarters, and the railroad's train schedules were published using its own time. Some major railroad junctions served by several different railroads had a separate clock for each railroad, each showing a different time. The distance between New York and Boston is about 2 degrees, or 8 minutes, which can be the difference between making or missing your train connection. If the difference between New York and Boston is 8 minutes, imagine the difference between Boston and Australia. The use of time zones irons out these differences and makes communication significantly smoother. A time zone is a region on earth that has a uniform standard time. There are 40 time zones on land because the earliest and latest time zones are 26 hours apart. Any given calendar date exists at some point on the globe for 50 hours. So the next time someone asks you "What time is it?" Your answer may be a whole lot more complicated than it used to be.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match.

Although Question 5 does not directly ask about the difference between New York and Boston, it does relate to the concept of time zones and the need to adjust clocks when traveling between locations with different local times. This is similar to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the specific time difference between New York and Boston.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more similar in terms of the specific information being asked, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I really had to choose, I would say: 
 Question 5

**Transcript**:
Probability is an area of mathematics
that is everywhere. We hear about it in weather forecasts, like there's an 80% chance
of snow tomorrow. It's used in making predictions in sports, such as determining the odds
for who will win the Super Bowl. Probability is also used in helping
to set auto insurance rates and it's what keeps casinos
and lotteries in business. How can probability affect you? Let's look at a simple
probability problem. Does it pay to randomly guess
on all 10 questions on a true/ false quiz? In other words,
if you were to toss a fair coin 10 times, and use it
to choose the answers, what is the probability
you would get a perfect score? It seems simple enough. There are only two
possible outcomes for each question. But with a 10-question true/ false quiz, there are lots of possible ways
to write down different combinations of Ts and Fs. To understand
how many different combinations, let's think about a much smaller
true/ false quiz with only two questions.
You could answer "true true," or "false false,"
or one of each. First "false" then "true,"
or first "true" then "false." So that's four different ways to write
the answers for a two-question quiz. What about a 10-question quiz? Well, this time, there are too many
to count and list by hand. In order to answer this question, we need
to know the fundamental counting principle. The fundamental counting principle states that if there are A possible outcomes
for one event, and B possible outcomes for another event, then there are A times B ways
to pair the outcomes. Clearly this works
for a two-question true/ false quiz. There are two different answers
you could write for the first question, and two different answers you could
write for the second question. That makes 2 times 2, or, 4 different ways
to write the answers for a two-question quiz. Now let's consider the 10-question quiz. To do this, we just need to extend
the fundamental counting principle a bit. We need to realize that there are two
possible answers for each of the 10 questions. So the number of possible outcomes is 2, times 2, times 2, times 2,
times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2. Or, a shorter way to say
that is 2 to the 10th power, which is equal to 1,024. That means of all the ways
you could write down your Ts and Fs, only one of the 1,024 ways would match
the teacher's answer key perfectly. So the probability of you getting
a perfect score by guessing is only 1 out of 1,024, or about a 10th of a percent. Clearly, guessing isn't a good idea. In fact, what would be
the most common score if you and all your friends
were to always randomly guess at every question on
a 10-question true/ false quiz? Well, not everyone would get
exactly 5 out of 10. But the average score, in the long run, would be 5. In a situation like this,
there are two possible outcomes: a question is right or wrong, and the probability
of being right by guessing is always the same: 1/2. To find the average number
you would get right by guessing, you multiply the number of questions by the probability
of getting the question right. Here, that is 10 times 1/2, or 5. Hopefully you study for quizzes, since it clearly doesn't pay to guess. But at one point, you probably took
a standardized test like the SAT, and most people have to guess
on a few questions. If there are 20 questions
and five possible answers for each question, what is the probability
you would get all 20 right by randomly guessing? And what should you expect
your score to be? Let's use the ideas from before. First, since the probability of getting
a question right by guessing is 1/5, we would expect to get 1/5
of the 20 questions right. Yikes - that's only four questions! Are you thinking that the probability
of getting all 20 questions correct is pretty small? Let's find out just how small. Do you recall the fundamental
counting principle that was stated before? With five possible outcomes
for each question, we would multiply 5 times 5
times 5 times 5 times... Well, we would just use 5 as a factor 20 times, and 5 to the 20th power is 95 trillion, 365 billion, 431 million, 648 thousand, 625.
Wow - that's huge! So the probability of getting all questions
correct by randomly guessing is about 1 in 95 trillion.

times 5 times 5 times... Well, we would just use 5 as a factor 20 times, and 5 to the 20th power is 95 trillion, 365 billion, 431 million, 648 thousand, 625.
Wow - that's huge! So the probability of getting all questions
correct by randomly guessing is about 1 in 95 trillion.

**Transcript**:
Probability is an area of mathematics
that is everywhere. We hear about it in weather forecasts, like there's an 80% chance
of snow tomorrow. It's used in making predictions in sports, such as determining the odds
for who will win the Super Bowl. Probability is also used in helping
to set auto insurance rates and it's what keeps casinos
and lotteries in business. How can probability affect you? Let's look at a simple
probability problem. Does it pay to randomly guess
on all 10 questions on a true/ false quiz? In other words,
if you were to toss a fair coin 10 times, and use it
to choose the answers, what is the probability
you would get a perfect score? It seems simple enough. There are only two
possible outcomes for each question. But with a 10-question true/ false quiz, there are lots of possible ways
to write down different combinations of Ts and Fs. To understand
how many different combinations, let's think about a much smaller
true/ false quiz with only two questions.
You could answer "true true," or "false false,"
or one of each. First "false" then "true,"
or first "true" then "false." So that's four different ways to write
the answers for a two-question quiz. What about a 10-question quiz? Well, this time, there are too many
to count and list by hand. In order to answer this question, we need
to know the fundamental counting principle. The fundamental counting principle states that if there are A possible outcomes
for one event, and B possible outcomes for another event, then there are A times B ways
to pair the outcomes. Clearly this works
for a two-question true/ false quiz. There are two different answers
you could write for the first question, and two different answers you could
write for the second question. That makes 2 times 2, or, 4 different ways
to write the answers for a two-question quiz. Now let's consider the 10-question quiz. To do this, we just need to extend
the fundamental counting principle a bit. We need to realize that there are two
possible answers for each of the 10 questions. So the number of possible outcomes is 2, times 2, times 2, times 2,
times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2. Or, a shorter way to say
that is 2 to the 10th power, which is equal to 1,024. That means of all the ways
you could write down your Ts and Fs, only one of the 1,024 ways would match
the teacher's answer key perfectly. So the probability of you getting
a perfect score by guessing is only 1 out of 1,024, or about a 10th of a percent. Clearly, guessing isn't a good idea. In fact, what would be
the most common score if you and all your friends
were to always randomly guess at every question on
a 10-question true/ false quiz? Well, not everyone would get
exactly 5 out of 10. But the average score, in the long run, would be 5. In a situation like this,
there are two possible outcomes: a question is right or wrong, and the probability
of being right by guessing is always the same: 1/2. To find the average number
you would get right by guessing, you multiply the number of questions by the probability
of getting the question right. Here, that is 10 times 1/2, or 5. Hopefully you study for quizzes, since it clearly doesn't pay to guess. But at one point, you probably took
a standardized test like the SAT, and most people have to guess
on a few questions. If there are 20 questions
and five possible answers for each question, what is the probability
you would get all 20 right by randomly guessing? And what should you expect
your score to be? Let's use the ideas from before. First, since the probability of getting
a question right by guessing is 1/5, we would expect to get 1/5
of the 20 questions right. Yikes - that's only four questions! Are you thinking that the probability
of getting all 20 questions correct is pretty small? Let's find out just how small. Do you recall the fundamental
counting principle that was stated before? With five possible outcomes
for each question, we would multiply 5 times 5
times 5 times 5 times... Well, we would just use 5 as a factor 20 times, and 5 to the 20th power is 95 trillion, 365 billion, 431 million, 648 thousand, 625.
Wow - that's huge! So the probability of getting all questions
correct by randomly guessing is about 1 in 95 trillion.

**Transcript**:
Every day we are bombarded on all platforms of media with personal stories that span the continuum from the embarrassing and the trivial to the dire and the critical. The foodie posting photos of every plate of lasagna he orders, the Iranian blogger describing the shooting death of Nedā Āghā-Soltān. Authentic narrative is the glue that connects people, providing a compelling reason to keep reading. It makes the personal universal, transcends the individual, and makes a story timeless and humanistic. How, as a journalist, do you ask the questions that yield this type of narrative? You have to know what to ask of whom. First you need to understand that every piece of journalism requires a trifecta of sourcing. If you picture the reporting process as depicted by a triangle, one side will be official sources, another side will be overview sources, and a third side will be unofficial sources. All three components are necessary in every well-reported piece. The first side has official sources. Those are the people with titles and expertise, who own the company; are spokespeople for the movement. They tell you the numbers, and the answers to how much, how many, where, when, and who. A second side of the triangle includes overview sources: academics, consultants, authors, who are not directly connected as stakeholders, but have knowledge of the big picture. Yet it is the third side of the trifecta - unofficial sources - who hold the power of the individual's insight. This is where you can find the why, Giving consequence on the event, trend, phase, or idea and what it means on a soul level to someone affected by it. So how do you mine for the gems, identifying what is compelling from what is chatter? You ask surprising questions. To achieve the complicated, fragile human connection, you regard the stories of every subject as sacred. Realize that an anecdote is oxygen that breathes life into a grey story of exposition, facts and data. What the surgeon did at home the morning he operated on a woman's brain tumor. How it feels to dream and train for the Olympics for a lifetime. There are times when it is important to convey information quickly, to present bulleted facts and updates. When a situation is urgent, when action is required now, when you need to know where the tornado will hit, how fast the fire is spreading, and if it will reach your home today. But the narrative personal stories that contribute to the buffet of journalism are pieces that have the luxury of a slow dance of information. It is this artful solicitation of story that will make the journalism memorable and will deliver the narrative bond that will connect us to each other.

**Transcript**:
Every day we are bombarded on all platforms of media with personal stories that span the continuum from the embarrassing and the trivial to the dire and the critical. The foodie posting photos of every plate of lasagna he orders, the Iranian blogger describing the shooting death of Nedā Āghā-Soltān. Authentic narrative is the glue that connects people, providing a compelling reason to keep reading. It makes the personal universal, transcends the individual, and makes a story timeless and humanistic. How, as a journalist, do you ask the questions that yield this type of narrative? You have to know what to ask of whom. First you need to understand that every piece of journalism requires a trifecta of sourcing. If you picture the reporting process as depicted by a triangle, one side will be official sources, another side will be overview sources, and a third side will be unofficial sources. All three components are necessary in every well-reported piece. The first side has official sources. Those are the people with titles and expertise, who own the company; are spokespeople for the movement. They tell you the numbers, and the answers to how much, how many, where, when, and who. A second side of the triangle includes overview sources: academics, consultants, authors, who are not directly connected as stakeholders, but have knowledge of the big picture. Yet it is the third side of the trifecta - unofficial sources - who hold the power of the individual's insight. This is where you can find the why, Giving consequence on the event, trend, phase, or idea and what it means on a soul level to someone affected by it. So how do you mine for the gems, identifying what is compelling from what is chatter? You ask surprising questions. To achieve the complicated, fragile human connection, you regard the stories of every subject as sacred. Realize that an anecdote is oxygen that breathes life into a grey story of exposition, facts and data. What the surgeon did at home the morning he operated on a woman's brain tumor. How it feels to dream and train for the Olympics for a lifetime. There are times when it is important to convey information quickly, to present bulleted facts and updates. When a situation is urgent, when action is required now, when you need to know where the tornado will hit, how fast the fire is spreading, and if it will reach your home today. But the narrative personal stories that contribute to the buffet of journalism are pieces that have the luxury of a slow dance of information. It is this artful solicitation of story that will make the journalism memorable and will deliver the narrative bond that will connect us to each other.

**Transcript**:
Emily Dickinson said over a century ago that "There is no frigate
like a book to take us lands away ..." And it's true. When we pick up a book,
turn on the TV, or watch a movie, we're carried away down the currents
of story into a world of imagination. And when we land, on a shore
that is both new and familiar, something strange happens. Stepping onto the shore, we're changed. We don't retrace
the footsteps of the authors or characters we followed here. No; instead, we walk a mile
in their shoes. Researchers in psychology, neuroscience,
child development and biology are finally starting to gain
quantifiable scientific evidence, showing what writers and readers
have always known: that stories have a unique ability
to change a person's point of view. Scholars are discovering evidence
that stories shape culture, and that much of what we believe
about life comes not from fact, but from fiction - that our ideas of class, marriage
and even gender are relatively new, and that many ideologies
which held fast for centuries were revised within the 18th century, and redrafted in the pages
of the early novel. Imagine a world where class,
and not hard work, decides a person's worth; a world where women
are simply men's more untamed copy; a world where marriage for love
is a novel notion. Well, that was the world
in which Samuel Richardson's "Pamela" first appeared. Richardson's love story
starred a poor, serving-class heroine, who is both more superior and smarter
than her upper-class suitor. The book, challenging
a slew of traditions, caused quite a ruckus. There was more press for "Pamela"
than for Parliament. It spawned intense debate
and several counter-novels. Still, for all those
who couldn't accept "Pamela," others were eager
for this new fictional world. This best seller
and all its literary heirs - "Pride and Prejudice,"
"Jane Eyre," and yes, even "Twilight" - have continuously shared the same tale
and taught similar lessons, which are now conventional
and commonplace. Similarly, novels have helped
shape the minds of thought leaders across history. Some scholars say
that Darwin's theory of evolution is highly indebted to the plots
he read and loved. His theory privileges intelligence,
swiftness, and adaptability to change - all core characteristics in a hero. Whether you're reading
"Harry Potter" or "Great Expectations," you're reading the kind of plot
that inspired Darwin. Yet, recent studies show that his theory
might not be the whole story. Our sense of being a hero -
one man or one woman or even one species
taking on the challenges of the world - might be wrong. Instead of being hardwired for competition for being the solitary heroes
in our own story, we might instead be members
of a shared quest. More Hobbit than Harry. Sometimes, of course,
the shoes we've been walking in can get plain worn out. After all, we haven't walked just one mile in Jane Austen's or Mark Twain's shoes - we've walked about
100 trillion miles in them. This isn't to say that we can't
read and enjoy the classics; we should travel with Dickens, let Pip teach us
what to expect from ourselves, have a talk with Austen and Elizabeth
about our prides and prejudices. We should float with Twain
down the Mississippi, and have Jim show us
what it means to be good. But on our journey,
we should also keep in mind that the terrain has changed. We'll start shopping around for boots that were made for walking into a new era. Take, for instance, Katniss Everdeen
and her battle with the Capitol. Can "Hunger Games" lead us into thinking
about capitalism in a new way? Can it teach us a lesson about why the individual should not
put herself before the group? Will "Uglies" reflect the dangers
of pursuing a perfect body and letting the media
define what is beautiful? Will "Seekers" trod a path
beyond global warming? Will the life-and-death struggles
of Toklo, Kallik, Lusa and the other bears chart a course for understanding animals
and our place in their world? Only the future will tell which stories
will engage our imagination, which tales of make-believe
we'll make tomorrow. But the good news is this: there are new stories
to venture in every day, new tales that promise to influence,
to create and to spark change - stories that you might
even write yourself. So I guess the final question is this: What story will you try on next?

Emily Dickinson said over a century ago that "There is no frigate
like a book to take us lands away ..." And it's true. When we pick up a book,
turn on the TV, or watch a movie, we're carried away down the currents
of story into a world of imagination. And when we land, on a shore
that is both new and familiar, something strange happens. Stepping onto the shore, we're changed. We don't retrace
the footsteps of the authors or characters we followed here. No; instead, we walk a mile
in their shoes. Researchers in psychology, neuroscience,
child development and biology are finally starting to gain
quantifiable scientific evidence, showing what writers and readers
have always known: that stories have a unique ability
to change a person's point of view. Scholars are discovering evidence
that stories shape culture, and that much of what we believe
about life comes not from fact, but from fiction - that our ideas of class, marriage
and even gender are relatively new, and that many ideologies
which held fast for centuries were revised within the 18th century, and redrafted in the pages
of the early novel. Imagine a world where class,
and not hard work, decides a person's worth; a world where women
are simply men's more untamed copy; a world where marriage for love
is a novel notion. Well, that was the world
in which Samuel Richardson's "Pamela" first appeared. Richardson's love story
starred a poor, serving-class heroine, who is both more superior and smarter
than her upper-class suitor. The book, challenging
a slew of traditions, caused quite a ruckus. There was more press for "Pamela"
than for Parliament. It spawned intense debate
and several counter-novels. Still, for all those
who couldn't accept "Pamela," others were eager
for this new fictional world. This best seller
and all its literary heirs - "Pride and Prejudice,"
"Jane Eyre," and yes, even "Twilight" - have continuously shared the same tale
and taught similar lessons, which are now conventional
and commonplace. Similarly, novels have helped
shape the minds of thought leaders across history. Some scholars say
that Darwin's theory of evolution is highly indebted to the plots
he read and loved. His theory privileges intelligence,
swiftness, and adaptability to change - all core characteristics in a hero. Whether you're reading
"Harry Potter" or "Great Expectations," you're reading the kind of plot
that inspired Darwin. Yet, recent studies show that his theory
might not be the whole story. Our sense of being a hero -
one man or one woman or even one species
taking on the challenges of the world - might be wrong. Instead of being hardwired for competition for being the solitary heroes
in our own story, we might instead be members
of a shared quest. More Hobbit than Harry. Sometimes, of course,
the shoes we've been walking in can get plain worn out. After all, we haven't walked just one mile in Jane Austen's or Mark Twain's shoes - we've walked about
100 trillion miles in them. This isn't to say that we can't
read and enjoy the classics; we should travel with Dickens, let Pip teach us
what to expect from ourselves, have a talk with Austen and Elizabeth
about our prides and prejudices. We should float with Twain
down the Mississippi, and have Jim show us
what it means to be good. But on our journey,
we should also keep in mind that the terrain has changed. We'll start shopping around for boots that were made for walking into a new era. Take, for instance, Katniss Everdeen
and her battle with the Capitol. Can "Hunger Games" lead us into thinking
about capitalism in a new way? Can it teach us a lesson about why the individual should not
put herself before the group? Will "Uglies" reflect the dangers
of pursuing a perfect body and letting the media
define what is beautiful? Will "Seekers" trod a path
beyond global warming? Will the life-and-death struggles
of Toklo, Kallik, Lusa and the other bears chart a course for understanding animals
and our place in their world? Only the future will tell which stories
will engage our imagination, which tales of make-believe
we'll make tomorrow. But the good news is this: there are new stories
to venture in every day, new tales that promise to influence,
to create and to spark change - stories that you might
even write yourself. So I guess the final question is this: What story will you try on next?

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
How does the difference between point 0000000398 and point 00000000398 cause one to have red eyes after swimming? To answer this, we first need a way of dealing with rather small numbers, or in some cases extremely large numbers. This leads us
to the concept of logarithms. Well, what are logarithms? Let's take the base number, b, and raise it to a power, p, like 2 to the 3rd power, and have it equal a number n. We get an exponential equation:
b raised to the p power, equals n. In our example, that'd be 2 raised to the 3rd power, equals 8. The exponent p is said to be the logarithm of the number n. Most of the time this would be written: "log, base b, of a number
equals p, the power." This is starting to sound a bit confusing
with all the variables, so let's show this with an example. What is the value of log base 10 of 10,000? The same question could be asked
using exponents: "10 raised to what power is 10,000?" Well, 10 to the 4th is 10,000. So, log base 10 of 10,000 must equal 4. This example can also be completed 
very simply on a scientific calculator. Log base 10 is used so frequently in the sciences that it has the honor of having
its own button on most calculators. If the calculator will figure out
logs for me, why study them? Just a quick reminder: the log button only computes
logarithms of base 10. What if you want to go into
computer science and need to understand base 2? So what is log base 2 of 64? In other words,
2 raised to what power is 64? Well, use your fingers.
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. So log base 2 of 64 must equal 6. So what does this have to do
with my eyes turning red in some swimming pools and not others? Well, it leads us into an interesting use of logarithms in chemistry: finding the pH of water samples. pH tells us how acidic
or basic a sample is, and can be calculated with the formula:  pH equals negative log base 10 of 
the hydrogen ion concentration, or H plus. We can find the pH of water samples with hydrogen ion concentration of 
point 0000000398 and point 00000000398 quickly on a calculator. Punch: negative log
of each of those numbers, and you'll see the pH's are 7.4 and 8.4. Since the tears in our eyes
have a pH of about 7.4, the H plus concentration of .0000000398 will feel nice on your eyes, but the pH of 8.4
will make you feel itchy and red. It's easy to remember logarithms
"log base b of some number n equals p" by repeating: "The base raised
to what power equals the number?" "The BASE raised to what POWER
equals the NUMBER?" So now we know
logarithms are very powerful when dealing with
extremely small or large numbers. Logarithms can even be used instead of eyedrops after swimming.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Ten raised to what power equals ten thousand?
Options: A. Ten to the forth, B. Ten to the fifth, C. Ten to the tenth, D. Ten to the one hundredth

**Transcript**:
How does the difference between point 0000000398 and point 00000000398 cause one to have red eyes after swimming? To answer this, we first need a way of dealing with rather small numbers, or in some cases extremely large numbers. This leads us
to the concept of logarithms. Well, what are logarithms? Let's take the base number, b, and raise it to a power, p, like 2 to the 3rd power, and have it equal a number n. We get an exponential equation:
b raised to the p power, equals n. In our example, that'd be 2 raised to the 3rd power, equals 8. The exponent p is said to be the logarithm of the number n. Most of the time this would be written: "log, base b, of a number
equals p, the power." This is starting to sound a bit confusing
with all the variables, so let's show this with an example. What is the value of log base 10 of 10,000? The same question could be asked
using exponents: "10 raised to what power is 10,000?" Well, 10 to the 4th is 10,000. So, log base 10 of 10,000 must equal 4. This example can also be completed 
very simply on a scientific calculator. Log base 10 is used so frequently in the sciences that it has the honor of having
its own button on most calculators. If the calculator will figure out
logs for me, why study them? Just a quick reminder: the log button only computes
logarithms of base 10. What if you want to go into
computer science and need to understand base 2? So what is log base 2 of 64? In other words,
2 raised to what power is 64? Well, use your fingers.
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. So log base 2 of 64 must equal 6. So what does this have to do
with my eyes turning red in some swimming pools and not others? Well, it leads us into an interesting use of logarithms in chemistry: finding the pH of water samples. pH tells us how acidic
or basic a sample is, and can be calculated with the formula:  pH equals negative log base 10 of 
the hydrogen ion concentration, or H plus. We can find the pH of water samples with hydrogen ion concentration of 
point 0000000398 and point 00000000398 quickly on a calculator. Punch: negative log
of each of those numbers, and you'll see the pH's are 7.4 and 8.4. Since the tears in our eyes
have a pH of about 7.4, the H plus concentration of .0000000398 will feel nice on your eyes, but the pH of 8.4
will make you feel itchy and red. It's easy to remember logarithms
"log base b of some number n equals p" by repeating: "The base raised
to what power equals the number?" "The BASE raised to what POWER
equals the NUMBER?" So now we know
logarithms are very powerful when dealing with
extremely small or large numbers. Logarithms can even be used instead of eyedrops after swimming.

**Transcript**:
We check the time every day, all day long. But did you ever wonder - where did telling time come from? Why does it matter what time it is? Who determined the clock and why in the world are there so many different time zones? The first form of telling time was the sundial and the earliest sundials known from the archaeological record are obelisks from nearly 5,000 years ago. Sundials indicate the time by casting a shadow onto a surface. The object that casts the shadow is a stick in the center known as a gnomon. A well-constructed sundial can measure time with remarkable accuracy, and sundials were used to monitor the performance of clocks until the modern era. But sundials have their limitations too. Obviously they require the sun to shine, so they don't work at all during the night when it's dark. Many different devices have been used over the years to estimate the passage of time: candles and sticks of incense that burn down at fairly predictable speeds have been used, along with the hourglass. Hourglasses are devices in which fine sand pours through a tiny hole at a constant rate and indicates a predetermined passage of an arbitrary period of time. The origin of the hourglass is uncertain, although beginning in the 14th century, the hourglass was used commonly, especially on board ships. The motion of the boat on the water did not affect the hourglass, unlike other time-measuring devices. The mechanical clock was invented in the 13th century which sparked a big change in traditional timekeeping methods. This modern clock relied on the swing of a pendulum or the vibration of a quartz crystal, which was far more accurate than sand or candles. Today, the basis for scientific time is a continuous count of seconds based on atomic clocks all around the world, known as the international atomic time. Why does it matter that we keep track of time? Well, time regulates our daily lives and makes it possible to accurately communicate with people all over the world. Without a time system, we would have many challenges in farming, social structures, communication, and business. Take the American railroad system, for example. In the mid-19th century, each railroad used its own standard time generally based on the local time of its headquarters, and the railroad's train schedules were published using its own time. Some major railroad junctions served by several different railroads had a separate clock for each railroad, each showing a different time. The distance between New York and Boston is about 2 degrees, or 8 minutes, which can be the difference between making or missing your train connection. If the difference between New York and Boston is 8 minutes, imagine the difference between Boston and Australia. The use of time zones irons out these differences and makes communication significantly smoother. A time zone is a region on earth that has a uniform standard time. There are 40 time zones on land because the earliest and latest time zones are 26 hours apart. Any given calendar date exists at some point on the globe for 50 hours. So the next time someone asks you "What time is it?" Your answer may be a whole lot more complicated than it used to be.

The use of time zones irons out these differences and makes communication significantly smoother. A time zone is a region on earth that has a uniform standard time. There are 40 time zones on land because the earliest and latest time zones are 26 hours apart. Any given calendar date exists at some point on the globe for 50 hours. So the next time someone asks you "What time is it?" Your answer may be a whole lot more complicated than it used to be.

**Transcript**:
We check the time every day, all day long. But did you ever wonder - where did telling time come from? Why does it matter what time it is? Who determined the clock and why in the world are there so many different time zones? The first form of telling time was the sundial and the earliest sundials known from the archaeological record are obelisks from nearly 5,000 years ago. Sundials indicate the time by casting a shadow onto a surface. The object that casts the shadow is a stick in the center known as a gnomon. A well-constructed sundial can measure time with remarkable accuracy, and sundials were used to monitor the performance of clocks until the modern era. But sundials have their limitations too. Obviously they require the sun to shine, so they don't work at all during the night when it's dark. Many different devices have been used over the years to estimate the passage of time: candles and sticks of incense that burn down at fairly predictable speeds have been used, along with the hourglass. Hourglasses are devices in which fine sand pours through a tiny hole at a constant rate and indicates a predetermined passage of an arbitrary period of time. The origin of the hourglass is uncertain, although beginning in the 14th century, the hourglass was used commonly, especially on board ships. The motion of the boat on the water did not affect the hourglass, unlike other time-measuring devices. The mechanical clock was invented in the 13th century which sparked a big change in traditional timekeeping methods. This modern clock relied on the swing of a pendulum or the vibration of a quartz crystal, which was far more accurate than sand or candles. Today, the basis for scientific time is a continuous count of seconds based on atomic clocks all around the world, known as the international atomic time. Why does it matter that we keep track of time? Well, time regulates our daily lives and makes it possible to accurately communicate with people all over the world. Without a time system, we would have many challenges in farming, social structures, communication, and business. Take the American railroad system, for example. In the mid-19th century, each railroad used its own standard time generally based on the local time of its headquarters, and the railroad's train schedules were published using its own time. Some major railroad junctions served by several different railroads had a separate clock for each railroad, each showing a different time. The distance between New York and Boston is about 2 degrees, or 8 minutes, which can be the difference between making or missing your train connection. If the difference between New York and Boston is 8 minutes, imagine the difference between Boston and Australia. The use of time zones irons out these differences and makes communication significantly smoother. A time zone is a region on earth that has a uniform standard time. There are 40 time zones on land because the earliest and latest time zones are 26 hours apart. Any given calendar date exists at some point on the globe for 50 hours. So the next time someone asks you "What time is it?" Your answer may be a whole lot more complicated than it used to be.
