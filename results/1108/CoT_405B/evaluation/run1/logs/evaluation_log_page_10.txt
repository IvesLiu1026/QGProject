**Transcript**:
At some point between 
the 1st and 5th century CE, the Hindu sage Patañjali began to codify
the ancient, meditative traditions practiced throughout India. He recorded techniques nearly as old 
as Indian civilization itself in 196 manuals called the Yoga Sutras. These texts defined yoga as the ‘yoking’ 
or restraining of the mind from focusing on external objects in efforts to reach a state 
of pure consciousness. Over time, yoga came to incorporate
physical elements from gymnastics and wrestling. Today, there are a multitude of approaches
to modern yoga— though most still maintain the three core
elements of Patañjali’s practice: physical postures, breathing exercises, 
and spiritual contemplation. This blend of physical 
and mental exercise is widely believed to have a unique set 
of health advantages. Such as improving strength
and flexibility, boosting heart and lung function, 
and enhancing psychological well-being. But what have contemporary studies shown
regarding the benefits of this ancient tradition? Despite attempts by many researchers, it's tough to make specific claims 
about yoga's advantages. Its unique combination of activities 
makes it difficult to determine which component is producing 
a specific health benefit. Additionally, yoga studies are often 
made up of small sample sizes that lack diversity, and the heavy reliance on self-reporting
makes results subjective. However, there are some health benefits that have more robust scientific 
support than others. Let’s start with flexibility and strength. Twisting your body 
into yoga’s physical postures stretches multiple muscle groups. In the short term, stretching can change
the water content of these muscles, ligaments, and tendons 
to make them more elastic. Over time, regular stretching 
stimulates stem cells which then differentiate 
into new muscle tissue and other cells that generate 
elastic collagen. Frequent stretching also reduces 
the body’s natural reflex to constrict muscles, improving your pain tolerance 
for feats of flexibility. Researchers haven’t found 
that any one form of yoga improves flexibility more than another, so the impact of specific 
postures is unclear. But like other low-impact exercises, yoga reliably improves fitness 
and flexibility in healthy populations. The practice has also been shown to be
a potentially powerful therapeutic tool. In studies involving patients with 
a variety of musculo-skeletal disorders, yoga was more helpful at reducing pain 
and improving mobility than other forms of low-impact exercise. Adding yoga to an existing 
exercise routine can improve strength and flexibility for hard to treat 
conditions like chronic lower back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Yoga’s mix of physical exercise 
and regimented breathing has proven similarly therapeutic 
for lung health. Lung diseases like chronic bronchitis, 
emphysema, and asthma shrink the passageways that carry oxygen, while weakening the membrane 
that brings oxygen into the blood. But breathing exercises 
like those found in yoga relax the muscles constricting 
those passageways and improve oxygen diffusion. Increasing the blood’s oxygen content
is especially helpful for those with weak heart muscles who have difficulty pumping
enough oxygen throughout the body. And for those with healthy hearts, this practice can lower blood pressure
and reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Yoga’s most widely celebrated benefit
may be the most difficult to prove: its psychological effects. Despite the longstanding association 
between yoga and psychological wellbeing, there’s little conclusive evidence 
on how the practice affects mental health. One of the biggest claims is that yoga improves symptoms 
of depression and anxiety disorders. Since diagnosis of these conditions
varies widely as do their origin and severity,
it’s difficult to quantify yoga’s impact. However, there is evidence to suggest that yoga can help reduce 
the symptoms of stress, as well as meditation or relaxation. Research on the effects 
of yoga is still evolving. In the future, we’ll need larger studies, 
incorporating diverse participants, which can measure yoga’s impact
on heart attacks, cancer rates, cognitive function and more. But for now, yoga can continue 
its ancient tradition as a way to exercise, reflect, and relax.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 1 is the closest in terms of content and intent.**

Although Question 1 does not directly ask about the origins of Yoga or mention the name "Patanjali" as an option, it does mention "the Hindu sage Patañjali" in the question stem, which is related to the ground truth MCQ. The other generated MCQs do not mention Patañjali or the origins of Yoga.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **1**

However, please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the origins of Yoga and includes Patañjali as an option.

**Transcript**:
At some point between 
the 1st and 5th century CE, the Hindu sage Patañjali began to codify
the ancient, meditative traditions practiced throughout India. He recorded techniques nearly as old 
as Indian civilization itself in 196 manuals called the Yoga Sutras. These texts defined yoga as the ‘yoking’ 
or restraining of the mind from focusing on external objects in efforts to reach a state 
of pure consciousness. Over time, yoga came to incorporate
physical elements from gymnastics and wrestling. Today, there are a multitude of approaches
to modern yoga— though most still maintain the three core
elements of Patañjali’s practice: physical postures, breathing exercises, 
and spiritual contemplation. This blend of physical 
and mental exercise is widely believed to have a unique set 
of health advantages. Such as improving strength
and flexibility, boosting heart and lung function, 
and enhancing psychological well-being. But what have contemporary studies shown
regarding the benefits of this ancient tradition? Despite attempts by many researchers, it's tough to make specific claims 
about yoga's advantages. Its unique combination of activities 
makes it difficult to determine which component is producing 
a specific health benefit. Additionally, yoga studies are often 
made up of small sample sizes that lack diversity, and the heavy reliance on self-reporting
makes results subjective. However, there are some health benefits that have more robust scientific 
support than others. Let’s start with flexibility and strength. Twisting your body 
into yoga’s physical postures stretches multiple muscle groups. In the short term, stretching can change
the water content of these muscles, ligaments, and tendons 
to make them more elastic. Over time, regular stretching 
stimulates stem cells which then differentiate 
into new muscle tissue and other cells that generate 
elastic collagen. Frequent stretching also reduces 
the body’s natural reflex to constrict muscles, improving your pain tolerance 
for feats of flexibility. Researchers haven’t found 
that any one form of yoga improves flexibility more than another, so the impact of specific 
postures is unclear. But like other low-impact exercises, yoga reliably improves fitness 
and flexibility in healthy populations. The practice has also been shown to be
a potentially powerful therapeutic tool. In studies involving patients with 
a variety of musculo-skeletal disorders, yoga was more helpful at reducing pain 
and improving mobility than other forms of low-impact exercise. Adding yoga to an existing 
exercise routine can improve strength and flexibility for hard to treat 
conditions like chronic lower back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Yoga’s mix of physical exercise 
and regimented breathing has proven similarly therapeutic 
for lung health. Lung diseases like chronic bronchitis, 
emphysema, and asthma shrink the passageways that carry oxygen, while weakening the membrane 
that brings oxygen into the blood. But breathing exercises 
like those found in yoga relax the muscles constricting 
those passageways and improve oxygen diffusion. Increasing the blood’s oxygen content
is especially helpful for those with weak heart muscles who have difficulty pumping
enough oxygen throughout the body. And for those with healthy hearts, this practice can lower blood pressure
and reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Yoga’s most widely celebrated benefit
may be the most difficult to prove: its psychological effects. Despite the longstanding association 
between yoga and psychological wellbeing, there’s little conclusive evidence 
on how the practice affects mental health. One of the biggest claims is that yoga improves symptoms 
of depression and anxiety disorders. Since diagnosis of these conditions
varies widely as do their origin and severity,
it’s difficult to quantify yoga’s impact. However, there is evidence to suggest that yoga can help reduce 
the symptoms of stress, as well as meditation or relaxation. Research on the effects 
of yoga is still evolving. In the future, we’ll need larger studies, 
incorporating diverse participants, which can measure yoga’s impact
on heart attacks, cancer rates, cognitive function and more. But for now, yoga can continue 
its ancient tradition as a way to exercise, reflect, and relax.

**Transcript**:
Steroids: they’re infamous 
for their use in sports. But they’re also found in inhalers, 
creams to treat poison ivy and eczema, and shots to ease inflammation. The steroids in these medicines aren’t 
the same as the ones used to build muscle. In fact, they’re all based on 
yet another steroid— one our body produces naturally, 
and we can’t live without. Taking a step back, the reason 
there are so many different steroids is because the term refers to substances 
with a shared molecular structure, rather than shared effects on the body. Steroids can be naturally occurring 
or synthetic, but what all steroids have in common 
is a molecular structure that consists of a base of four rings 
made of 17 carbon atoms arranged in three hexagons 
and one pentagon. A molecule must contain 
this exact arrangement to be a steroid, though most also have side chains— additional atoms that can dramatically 
impact the molecule’s function. Steroids get their name 
from the fatty molecule cholesterol. In fact, our bodies make steroids 
out of cholesterol. That fatty cholesterol base 
means that steroids are able to cross fatty cell membranes 
and enter cells. Within the cell, they can directly 
influence gene expression and protein synthesis. This is different from many other types 
of signaling molecules, which can’t cross the cell membrane and have to create their effects 
from outside the cell, through more complicated pathways. So steroids can create their effects 
faster than those other molecules. Back to the steroids 
in anti-inflammatory medications: all of these are based on a naturally 
occurring steroid called cortisol. Cortisol is the body’s 
primary stress signal, and it has a huge range of functions. When we experience a stressor— anything from a fight with a friend, 
to spotting a bear, to an infection or low blood sugar— the brain reacts by sending a signal from 
the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland then sends a signal 
to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands produce cortisol, 
and release some constantly. But when they receive the signal 
from the pituitary gland, they release a burst of cortisol, which spurs the body to generate 
more glucose for energy, decrease functions not immediately 
related to survival, like digestion, and can activate 
a fight-flight-or-freeze response. This is helpful in the short term, 
but can cause undesirable side effects like insomnia and lowered mood 
if they last too long. Cortisol also interacts 
with the immune system in complex ways— depending on the situation, it can increase or decrease 
certain immune functions. In the process of fighting infection, the immune system 
often creates inflammation. Cortisol suppresses the immune system’s 
ability to produce inflammation, which, again, 
can be useful in the short term. But too much cortisol 
can have negative impacts, like reducing the immune system’s ability 
to regenerate bone marrow and lymph nodes. To prevent levels 
from staying high for too long, cortisol suppresses the signal 
that causes the adrenal glands to release more cortisol. Medicinal corticosteroids channel 
cortisol’s effects on the immune system to fight allergic reactions, 
rashes, and asthma. All these things are forms 
of inflammation. There are many synthetic steroids 
that share the same basic mechanism: they enhance the body’s cortisol supply, which in turn shuts down 
the hyperactive immune responses that cause inflammation. These corticosteroids sneak into cells 
and can turn off the “fire alarm” by suppressing gene expression 
of inflammatory signals. The steroids in inhalers and creams impact
only the affected organ— the skin, or the lungs. Intravenous or oral versions, used 
to treat chronic autoimmune conditions like lupus or inflammatory bowel disease, 
impact the whole body. With these conditions, the body’s 
immune system attacks its own cells, a process analogous to a constant 
asthma attack or rash. A constant low dose of steroids can help keep this renegade
immune response under control— but because of the negative psychological 
and physiological effects of longterm exposure, higher doses are reserved 
for emergencies and flare-ups. While an asthma attack, poison ivy welts, 
and irritable bowel syndrome might seem totally unrelated, 
they all have something in common: an immune response 
that’s doing more harm than good. And while corticosteroids 
won’t give you giant muscles, they can be the body’s best defense 
against itself.

to spotting a bear, to an infection or low blood sugar— the brain reacts by sending a signal from 
the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland then sends a signal 
to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands produce cortisol, 
and release some constantly. But when they receive the signal 
from the pituitary gland, they release a burst of cortisol, which spurs the body to generate 
more glucose for energy, decrease functions not immediately 
related to survival, like digestion, and can activate 
a fight-flight-or-freeze response. This is helpful in the short term, 
but can cause undesirable side effects like insomnia and lowered mood 
if they last too long. Cortisol also interacts 
with the immune system in complex ways— depending on the situation, it can increase or decrease 
certain immune functions. In the process of fighting infection, the immune system 
often creates inflammation. Cortisol suppresses the immune system’s 
ability to produce inflammation, which, again, 
can be useful in the short term. But too much cortisol 
can have negative impacts, like reducing the immune system’s ability 
to regenerate bone marrow and lymph nodes. To prevent levels 
from staying high for too long, cortisol suppresses the signal 
that causes the adrenal glands to release more cortisol. Medicinal corticosteroids channel 
cortisol’s effects on the immune system to fight allergic reactions, 
rashes, and asthma. All these things are forms 
of inflammation. There are many synthetic steroids 
that share the same basic mechanism: they enhance the body’s cortisol supply, which in turn shuts down 
the hyperactive immune responses that cause inflammation. These corticosteroids sneak into cells 
and can turn off the “fire alarm” by suppressing gene expression 
of inflammatory signals. The steroids in inhalers and creams impact
only the affected organ— the skin, or the lungs. Intravenous or oral versions, used 
to treat chronic autoimmune conditions like lupus or inflammatory bowel disease, 
impact the whole body. With these conditions, the body’s 
immune system attacks its own cells, a process analogous to a constant 
asthma attack or rash. A constant low dose of steroids can help keep this renegade
immune response under control— but because of the negative psychological 
and physiological effects of longterm exposure, higher doses are reserved 
for emergencies and flare-ups. While an asthma attack, poison ivy welts, 
and irritable bowel syndrome might seem totally unrelated, 
they all have something in common: an immune response 
that’s doing more harm than good. And while corticosteroids 
won’t give you giant muscles, they can be the body’s best defense 
against itself.

Steroids: they’re infamous 
for their use in sports. But they’re also found in inhalers, 
creams to treat poison ivy and eczema, and shots to ease inflammation. The steroids in these medicines aren’t 
the same as the ones used to build muscle. In fact, they’re all based on 
yet another steroid— one our body produces naturally, 
and we can’t live without. Taking a step back, the reason 
there are so many different steroids is because the term refers to substances 
with a shared molecular structure, rather than shared effects on the body. Steroids can be naturally occurring 
or synthetic, but what all steroids have in common 
is a molecular structure that consists of a base of four rings 
made of 17 carbon atoms arranged in three hexagons 
and one pentagon. A molecule must contain 
this exact arrangement to be a steroid, though most also have side chains— additional atoms that can dramatically 
impact the molecule’s function. Steroids get their name 
from the fatty molecule cholesterol. In fact, our bodies make steroids 
out of cholesterol. That fatty cholesterol base 
means that steroids are able to cross fatty cell membranes 
and enter cells. Within the cell, they can directly 
influence gene expression and protein synthesis. This is different from many other types 
of signaling molecules, which can’t cross the cell membrane and have to create their effects

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: What is the body's primary stress signal? Options: A. Adrenaline, B. Cortisol, C. Insulin, D. Oxytocin Correct Option: B.

However, the question content of the ground truth MCQ is more closely related to Question 8: What is the relationship between cortisol and the immune system? Options: A. Cortisol enhances the immune system's ability to produce inflammation, B. Cortisol suppresses the immune system's ability to produce inflammation, C. Cortisol has no effect on the immune system, D. Cortisol only affects the immune system in times of stress Correct Option: B.

But the question that best matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ is Question 2 doesn't fully capture the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the primary function of cortisol. Question 8 is closer in terms of content but doesn't fully match the intent either.

Upon closer inspection, Question 9: What is a key difference between the short-term and long-term effects of cortisol on the body? Options: A. Short-term effects are detrimental, while long-term effects are beneficial, B. Short-term effects are beneficial, while long-term effects can be detrimental, C.

Short-term effects are beneficial, while long-term effects are neutral Correct Option: B does not match the intent but Question 8 and Question 2 are the closest.

However Question 8 does not fully capture the primary function of cortisol as asked by the ground truth MCQ. 

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ would be one that asks about the primary function of cortisol, which is not explicitly present in the generated MCQs.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 11: What can be inferred about steroids based on their molecular structure? 

Options: A. Steroids are only useful for building muscle, B. Steroids have a range of effects on the body, including regulating the immune system, C. Steroids are only naturally occurring, D. Steroids are only synthetic 

Correct Option: B

However, an even more similar question would be one that directly asks about the commonality among steroids. In that case, a more suitable match would be:

Question 10: What is a key insight that can be gained by recognizing the molecular structure of steroids? 

Options: A. Steroids are only useful for building muscle, B. Steroids have a range of beneficial effects on the body, particularly in regulating the immune system, C. Steroids are only naturally occurring, D. Steroids are only synthetic 

Correct Option: B

But since neither of these questions perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ, let's try to find a better match.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the commonality among steroids. One such question is:

Question 3: What allows steroids to directly influence gene expression and protein synthesis within cells? 

Options: A. Their ability to cross cell membranes and enter cells, B. Their ability to bind to specific receptors on the cell surface, C. Their ability to activate specific enzymes within cells, D. Their ability to alter the cell's pH levels 

Correct Option: A

However, this question still doesn't directly ask about the commonality among steroids.

Let's try to find an even better match.

A question that directly asks about the commonality among steroids is not available in the given set of generated MCQs. However, we can try to find a question that asks about the structure of steroids, which is the common aspect among them.

One such question is:

Question 1: What is the primary source from which steroids get their name? 

Options: A. Fatty molecule triglyceride, B. Fatty molecule cholesterol, C. Protein molecule hemoglobin, D. Carbohydrate molecule glucose 

Correct Option: B

However, this question still doesn't directly ask about the commonality among steroids.

Since we couldn't find a perfect match, let's try to find the best available match.

Considering all the generated MCQs, the best available match for the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 11: What can be inferred about steroids based on their molecular structure? 

However, an even better match would be a question that directly asks about the structure of steroids. One such question is not available in the given set, but we can consider a question that asks about the source of the name of steroids, which is related to their structure.

Considering this, the best available match is:

Question 1 doesn't directly ask about the commonality, but Question 11 doesn't perfectly match the ground truth MCQ either.

However, there is another question that might be considered a good match:

Not available.

But we have:

Question 11: What can be inferred about steroids based on their molecular structure?

We can consider it, but let's look at another option.

We have:

Question 1: What is the primary source from which steroids get their name?

This question relates to the structure of steroids, which is the basis for their commonality.

Considering the intent of the ground truth MCQ, the best match among the generated MCQs would be a question that asks about the structure of steroids.

However, since we don't have a question that directly asks about the commonality among steroids, we can consider a question that asks about the source of their name, which is related to their structure.

The best match is Question 11, but we also have Question 1.

However, the most suitable match is:

Question 11.

and release some constantly. But when they receive the signal 
from the pituitary gland, they release a burst of cortisol, which spurs the body to generate 
more glucose for energy, decrease functions not immediately 
related to survival, like digestion, and can activate 
a fight-flight-or-freeze response. This is helpful in the short term, 
but can cause undesirable side effects like insomnia and lowered mood 
if they last too long. Cortisol also interacts 
with the immune system in complex ways— depending on the situation, it can increase or decrease 
certain immune functions. In the process of fighting infection, the immune system 
often creates inflammation. Cortisol suppresses the immune system’s 
ability to produce inflammation, which, again, 
can be useful in the short term. But too much cortisol 
can have negative impacts, like reducing the immune system’s ability 
to regenerate bone marrow and lymph nodes. To prevent levels 
from staying high for too long, cortisol suppresses the signal 
that causes the adrenal glands to release more cortisol. Medicinal corticosteroids channel 
cortisol’s effects on the immune system to fight allergic reactions, 
rashes, and asthma. All these things are forms 
of inflammation. There are many synthetic steroids 
that share the same basic mechanism: they enhance the body’s cortisol supply, which in turn shuts down 
the hyperactive immune responses that cause inflammation. These corticosteroids sneak into cells 
and can turn off the “fire alarm” by suppressing gene expression 
of inflammatory signals. The steroids in inhalers and creams impact
only the affected organ— the skin, or the lungs. Intravenous or oral versions, used 
to treat chronic autoimmune conditions like lupus or inflammatory bowel disease, 
impact the whole body. With these conditions, the body’s 
immune system attacks its own cells, a process analogous to a constant 
asthma attack or rash. A constant low dose of steroids can help keep this renegade
immune response under control— but because of the negative psychological 
and physiological effects of longterm exposure, higher doses are reserved 
for emergencies and flare-ups. While an asthma attack, poison ivy welts, 
and irritable bowel syndrome might seem totally unrelated, 
they all have something in common: an immune response 
that’s doing more harm than good. And while corticosteroids 
won’t give you giant muscles, they can be the body’s best defense 
against itself.

Steroids: they’re infamous 
for their use in sports. But they’re also found in inhalers, 
creams to treat poison ivy and eczema, and shots to ease inflammation. The steroids in these medicines aren’t 
the same as the ones used to build muscle. In fact, they’re all based on 
yet another steroid— one our body produces naturally, 
and we can’t live without. Taking a step back, the reason 
there are so many different steroids is because the term refers to substances 
with a shared molecular structure, rather than shared effects on the body. Steroids can be naturally occurring 
or synthetic, but what all steroids have in common 
is a molecular structure that consists of a base of four rings 
made of 17 carbon atoms arranged in three hexagons 
and one pentagon. A molecule must contain 
this exact arrangement to be a steroid, though most also have side chains— additional atoms that can dramatically 
impact the molecule’s function. Steroids get their name 
from the fatty molecule cholesterol. In fact, our bodies make steroids 
out of cholesterol. That fatty cholesterol base 
means that steroids are able to cross fatty cell membranes 
and enter cells. Within the cell, they can directly 
influence gene expression and protein synthesis. This is different from many other types 
of signaling molecules, which can’t cross the cell membrane and have to create their effects 
from outside the cell, through more complicated pathways. So steroids can create their effects 
faster than those other molecules. Back to the steroids 
in anti-inflammatory medications: all of these are based on a naturally 
occurring steroid called cortisol. Cortisol is the body’s 
primary stress signal, and it has a huge range of functions. When we experience a stressor— anything from a fight with a friend, 
to spotting a bear, to an infection or low blood sugar— the brain reacts by sending a signal from 
the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland then sends a signal 
to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands produce cortisol, 
and release some constantly. But when they receive the signal 
from the pituitary gland, they release a burst of cortisol, which spurs the body to generate

Cortisol only affects the immune system in times of stress Correct Option: B.

But the question that best matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ is Question 2 doesn't fully capture the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the primary function of cortisol. Question 8 is closer in terms of content but doesn't fully match the intent either.

Upon closer inspection, Question 9: What is a key difference between the short-term and long-term effects of cortisol on the body? Options: A. Short-term effects are detrimental, while long-term effects are beneficial, B. Short-term effects are beneficial, while long-term effects can be detrimental, C.

asthma attack or rash. A constant low dose of steroids can help keep this renegade
immune response under control— but because of the negative psychological 
and physiological effects of longterm exposure, higher doses are reserved 
for emergencies and flare-ups. While an asthma attack, poison ivy welts,

that’s doing more harm than good. And while corticosteroids 
won’t give you giant muscles, they can be the body’s best defense 
against itself.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

This question asks about the mechanism by which steroids exert their effects within cells, which aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ. The correct option in Question 3 (A. Their ability to cross cell membranes and enter cells) is related to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (A. They bind to steroid receptors in the cell, which activates or suppresses gene expression in the nucleus), as steroids' ability to cross cell membranes is a necessary step for them to bind to steroid receptors and influence gene expression.

While the options in Question 3 do not exactly match those in the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are similar enough to make Question 3 the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the concept of regeneration, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 5: What is a potential application of studying axolotls' regenerative abilities? Options: A. Helping to slow down aging in humans, B. Helping burn victims, amputees, and cancer victims, C. Improving vision in humans, D. Enhancing athletic performance Correct Option: B

Although this generated MCQ does not directly ask about the definition of regeneration, it is related to the concept of regeneration and its potential applications. However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar in terms of question type (definition-based), I would suggest:

There is no direct match, but if I had to choose, I would say Question 8, as it does discuss a unique feature of axolotls, but it is still not a direct match.

Please note that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, and it would be best to create a new MCQ that directly asks about the definition of regeneration.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5 (or 8, depending on the criteria)

**Transcript**:
Okay, now I don't want
to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention
that the person to your right is a liar. (Laughter) Also, the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting
in your very seats is a liar. We're all liars. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research
says about why we're all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want
to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building. Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrote
this book, "Liespotting," no one wants to meet me in person
anymore, no, no, no, no, no. They say, "It's okay, we'll email you." (Laughter) I can't even get
a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like, "Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking.
How about French cooking?" So before I get started,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room
that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.
You flared your nostril. I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'
I know you're lying." No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge
of how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature
leaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations
with difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees
to believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point
you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying:
Lying's a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing
participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should
be kept secret, secret. We say, "Nice song." "Honey, you don't look fat in that, no." Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, "You know, I just fished
that email out of my Spam folder. So sorry." But there are times when we are unwilling
participants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone
in the United States. That's an eyelash
under a trillion dollars. That's seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case
of double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,
they can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths
of those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man, Henry Oberlander,
he was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermined the entire
banking system of the Western world. And you can't find this guy on Google;
you can't find him anywhere. He was interviewed once,
and he said the following. He said, "Look, I've got one rule." And this was Henry's rule, he said, "Look, everyone is willing
to give you something. They're ready to give you something
for whatever it is they're hungry for." And that's the crux of it. If you don't want to be
deceived, you have to know, what is it that you're hungry for? And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were
better husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were,
how we wish we could be, with what we're really like. And boy are we willing to fill in
those gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show
that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many of those are white lies. But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes
of meeting each other. (Laughter) Now when we first hear
this data, we recoil. We can't believe how prevalent lying is. We're essentially against lying. But if you look more closely,
the plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers
than we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves
than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're an average married couple, you're going to lie to your spouse
in one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried,
that number drops to three. Lying's complex. It's woven into the fabric
of our daily and our business lives. We're deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because
we don't understand the gaps in our lives. That's truth number two about lying. We're against lying, but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned
for centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture,
it's part of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare,
the Bible, News of the World. (Laughter) Lying has evolutionary value
to us as a species. Researchers have long known
that the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla
who was taught sign language? Koko was taught to communicate
via sign language. Here's Koko with her kitten. It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten
for ripping a sink out of the wall. (Laughter) We're hardwired to become
leaders of the pack. It's starts really, really early. How early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn concealment. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. Five-year-olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom
in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world
and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered
with Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls
a post-truth society. It's been very confusing
for a long time now. What do you do? Well, there are steps we can take
to navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth
90 percent of the time. The rest of us,
we're only 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes.
We all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to show you two patterns of deception. And then we're going
to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. (Video) Bill Clinton:
I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie,
not a single time, never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work
for the American people. Thank you. (Applause) Pamela Meyer: Okay,
what were the telltale signs? Well first we heard what's known
as a non-contracted denial. Studies show that people
who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather
than informal language. We also heard
distancing language: "that woman." We know that liars will unconsciously
distance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said,
"Well, to tell you the truth ..." or Richard Nixon's favorite,
"In all candor ..." he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language, as it's called,
qualifying language like that, further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated
the question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account
with a little too much detail -- and we're all really glad
he didn't do that -- he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said, look,
there's much more to it than speech: "No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent,
he chatters with his fingertips." And we all do it no matter
how powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I'm going to show you
Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips. (Laughter) Now this brings us to our next pattern,
which is body language. With body language,
here's what you've got to do. You've really got to just throw
your assumptions out the door. Let the science temper
your knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars
fidget all the time. Well guess what, they're known to freeze
their upper bodies when they're lying. We think liars won't look you in the eyes. Well guess what, they look
you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles
convey honesty, sincerity. But a trained liespotter
can spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contract
the muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile's in the eyes,
the crow's feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Don't overdo the Botox;
nobody will think you're honest. Now we're going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what's happening
in a conversation? Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words
and someone's actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you're having a conversation
with someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked
but telling of indicators. An honest person
is going to be cooperative. They're going to show
they're on your side. They're going to be enthusiastic. They're going to be willing and helpful
to getting you to the truth. They're going to be willing
to brainstorm, name suspects, provide details. They're going to say, "Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll
that forged those checks." They're going to be infuriated
if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course
of the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout
the entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen
to whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather
than lenient punishment. Now let's say you're having
that exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky. Ask a deceptive person
to tell their story, they're going to pepper it
with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they're going to tell their story
in strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways
over the course of several hours, they will ask that person
to tell that story backwards, and then they'll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce
the highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that?
Well, we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say "yes," we shake our heads "no." We tell very convincing stories,
we slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes, and we smile at the delight
in getting away with it. Now, that smile is known
in the trade as "duping delight." And we're going to see that
in several videos moving forward, but we're going to start --
for those of you who don't know him, this is presidential
candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering
a child out of wedlock. We're going to see him talk
about getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot him
saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no," slightly shrugging his shoulders. (Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy
to participate in one. I know that it's not possible
that this child could be mine, because of the timing of events. So I know it's not possible. Happy to take a paternity test,
and would love to see it happen. Interviewer: Are you going to do
that soon? Is there somebody -- JE: Well, I'm only one side.
I'm only one side of the test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM: Okay, those head shakes
are much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times
when someone makes one expression while masking another that just
kind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner
might shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with you
and then leak an expression of anger. And we're not all going to become
facial expression experts overnight here, but there's one I can teach you
that's very dangerous and it's easy to learn, and that's the expression of contempt. Now with anger, you've got
two people on an even playing field. It's still somewhat
of a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,
you've been dismissed. It's associated with moral superiority. And for that reason, it's very,
very hard to recover from. Here's what it looks like. It's marked by one lip corner
pulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt,
whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way,
go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you." Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures
all over the place all day long. They don't mean anything
in and of themselves. But when you see clusters
of them, that's your signal. Look, listen, probe,
ask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable
mode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode,
ask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person
you're talking to with rapport. Don't try to be like those folks
on "Law & Order" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects
into submission. Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work. Now, we've talked a little bit
about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised, we're now going
to look at what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying,
one is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher
David Matsumoto in California. And I think they're an excellent example
of what the truth looks like. This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital
while they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it. And you'll see when you see the video, she can't even pretend
to be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here
is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes
and her very, very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you'll see
duping delight throughout this video. (Video) Diane Downs:
At night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reaching
her hand out to me while I'm driving, and the blood just kept
coming out of her mouth. And that -- maybe
it'll fade too with time -- but I don't think so. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother,
Erin Runnion, confronting her daughter's murderer
and torturer in court. Here you're going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression
of a mother's agony. (Video) Erin Runnion:
I wrote this statement on the third anniversary
of the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought, and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you
with those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her. And I don't understand it, and I never will. PM: Okay, there's no doubting
the veracity of those emotions. Now the technology
around what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it. We know, for example, that we now have specialized eye trackers
and infrared brain scans, MRI's that can decode the signals
that our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going
to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove
incredibly useful some day. But you've got to ask yourself
in the meantime: Who do you want on your side
of the meeting, someone who's trained
in getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag
a 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door? Liespotters rely on human tools. They know, as someone once said, "Character's who you are in the dark." And what's kind of interesting
is that today, we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 24 hours a day. It's transparent
with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz
of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live
their lives in public. It's a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, that's not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting
can blind us to the fact that the subtleties
of human decency -- character integrity -- that's still what matters,
that's always what's going to matter. So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit
about our moral code. When you combine the science
of recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself
from collaborating in a lie. You start up that path
of being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, "Hey, my world, our world,
it's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be
one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized
and marginalized." And when you do that, the ground around you starts
to shift just a little bit. And that's the truth. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Okay, now I don't want
to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention
that the person to your right is a liar. (Laughter) Also, the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting
in your very seats is a liar. We're all liars. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research
says about why we're all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want
to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building. Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrote
this book, "Liespotting," no one wants to meet me in person
anymore, no, no, no, no, no. They say, "It's okay, we'll email you." (Laughter) I can't even get
a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like, "Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking.
How about French cooking?" So before I get started,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room
that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.
You flared your nostril. I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'
I know you're lying." No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge
of how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature
leaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations
with difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees
to believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point
you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying:
Lying's a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing
participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should
be kept secret, secret. We say, "Nice song." "Honey, you don't look fat in that, no." Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, "You know, I just fished

and then leak an expression of anger. And we're not all going to become
facial expression experts overnight here, but there's one I can teach you
that's very dangerous and it's easy to learn, and that's the expression of contempt. Now with anger, you've got
two people on an even playing field. It's still somewhat
of a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,
you've been dismissed. It's associated with moral superiority. And for that reason, it's very,
very hard to recover from. Here's what it looks like. It's marked by one lip corner
pulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt,
whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way,
go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you." Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures
all over the place all day long. They don't mean anything
in and of themselves. But when you see clusters
of them, that's your signal. Look, listen, probe,
ask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable
mode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode,
ask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person
you're talking to with rapport. Don't try to be like those folks
on "Law & Order" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects
into submission. Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work. Now, we've talked a little bit
about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised, we're now going
to look at what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying,
one is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher
David Matsumoto in California. And I think they're an excellent example
of what the truth looks like. This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital
while they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it. And you'll see when you see the video, she can't even pretend
to be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here
is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes
and her very, very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you'll see
duping delight throughout this video. (Video) Diane Downs:
At night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reaching
her hand out to me while I'm driving, and the blood just kept
coming out of her mouth. And that -- maybe
it'll fade too with time -- but I don't think so. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother,
Erin Runnion, confronting her daughter's murderer
and torturer in court. Here you're going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression
of a mother's agony. (Video) Erin Runnion:
I wrote this statement on the third anniversary
of the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought, and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you
with those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her. And I don't understand it, and I never will. PM: Okay, there's no doubting
the veracity of those emotions. Now the technology
around what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it. We know, for example, that we now have specialized eye trackers
and infrared brain scans, MRI's that can decode the signals
that our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going
to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove
incredibly useful some day. But you've got to ask yourself
in the meantime: Who do you want on your side
of the meeting, someone who's trained
in getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag
a 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door? Liespotters rely on human tools. They know, as someone once said, "Character's who you are in the dark." And what's kind of interesting
is that today, we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 24 hours a day. It's transparent
with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz
of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live
their lives in public. It's a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, that's not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting
can blind us to the fact that the subtleties
of human decency -- character integrity -- that's still what matters,
that's always what's going to matter. So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit
about our moral code. When you combine the science
of recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself
from collaborating in a lie. You start up that path
of being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, "Hey, my world, our world,
it's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be
one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized
and marginalized." And when you do that, the ground around you starts
to shift just a little bit. And that's the truth. Thank you. (Applause)

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Okay, now I don't want
to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention
that the person to your right is a liar. (Laughter) Also, the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting
in your very seats is a liar. We're all liars. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research
says about why we're all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want
to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building. Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrote
this book, "Liespotting," no one wants to meet me in person
anymore, no, no, no, no, no. They say, "It's okay, we'll email you." (Laughter) I can't even get
a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like, "Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking.
How about French cooking?" So before I get started,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room
that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.
You flared your nostril. I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'
I know you're lying." No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge
of how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature
leaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations
with difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees
to believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point
you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying:
Lying's a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing
participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should
be kept secret, secret. We say, "Nice song." "Honey, you don't look fat in that, no." Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, "You know, I just fished
that email out of my Spam folder. So sorry." But there are times when we are unwilling
participants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone
in the United States. That's an eyelash
under a trillion dollars. That's seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case
of double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,
they can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths
of those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man, Henry Oberlander,
he was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermined the entire
banking system of the Western world. And you can't find this guy on Google;
you can't find him anywhere. He was interviewed once,
and he said the following. He said, "Look, I've got one rule." And this was Henry's rule, he said, "Look, everyone is willing
to give you something. They're ready to give you something
for whatever it is they're hungry for." And that's the crux of it. If you don't want to be
deceived, you have to know, what is it that you're hungry for? And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were
better husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were,
how we wish we could be, with what we're really like. And boy are we willing to fill in
those gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show
that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many of those are white lies. But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes
of meeting each other. (Laughter) Now when we first hear
this data, we recoil. We can't believe how prevalent lying is. We're essentially against lying. But if you look more closely,
the plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers
than we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves
than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're an average married couple, you're going to lie to your spouse
in one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried,
that number drops to three. Lying's complex. It's woven into the fabric
of our daily and our business lives. We're deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because
we don't understand the gaps in our lives. That's truth number two about lying. We're against lying, but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned
for centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture,
it's part of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare,
the Bible, News of the World. (Laughter) Lying has evolutionary value
to us as a species. Researchers have long known
that the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla
who was taught sign language? Koko was taught to communicate
via sign language. Here's Koko with her kitten. It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten
for ripping a sink out of the wall. (Laughter) We're hardwired to become
leaders of the pack. It's starts really, really early. How early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn concealment. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. Five-year-olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom
in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world
and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered
with Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls
a post-truth society. It's been very confusing
for a long time now. What do you do? Well, there are steps we can take
to navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth
90 percent of the time. The rest of us,
we're only 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes.
We all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to show you two patterns of deception. And then we're going
to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. (Video) Bill Clinton:
I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie,
not a single time, never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work
for the American people. Thank you. (Applause) Pamela Meyer: Okay,
what were the telltale signs? Well first we heard what's known
as a non-contracted denial. Studies show that people
who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather
than informal language. We also heard
distancing language: "that woman." We know that liars will unconsciously
distance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said,
"Well, to tell you the truth ..." or Richard Nixon's favorite,
"In all candor ..." he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language, as it's called,
qualifying language like that, further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated
the question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account
with a little too much detail -- and we're all really glad
he didn't do that -- he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said, look,
there's much more to it than speech: "No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent,
he chatters with his fingertips." And we all do it no matter
how powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I'm going to show you
Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips. (Laughter) Now this brings us to our next pattern,
which is body language. With body language,
here's what you've got to do. You've really got to just throw
your assumptions out the door. Let the science temper
your knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars
fidget all the time. Well guess what, they're known to freeze
their upper bodies when they're lying. We think liars won't look you in the eyes. Well guess what, they look
you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles
convey honesty, sincerity. But a trained liespotter
can spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contract
the muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile's in the eyes,
the crow's feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Don't overdo the Botox;
nobody will think you're honest. Now we're going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what's happening
in a conversation? Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words
and someone's actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you're having a conversation
with someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked
but telling of indicators. An honest person
is going to be cooperative. They're going to show
they're on your side. They're going to be enthusiastic. They're going to be willing and helpful
to getting you to the truth. They're going to be willing
to brainstorm, name suspects, provide details. They're going to say, "Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll
that forged those checks." They're going to be infuriated
if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course
of the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout
the entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen
to whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather
than lenient punishment. Now let's say you're having
that exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky. Ask a deceptive person
to tell their story, they're going to pepper it
with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they're going to tell their story
in strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways
over the course of several hours, they will ask that person
to tell that story backwards, and then they'll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce
the highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that?
Well, we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say "yes," we shake our heads "no." We tell very convincing stories,
we slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes, and we smile at the delight
in getting away with it. Now, that smile is known
in the trade as "duping delight." And we're going to see that
in several videos moving forward, but we're going to start --
for those of you who don't know him, this is presidential
candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering
a child out of wedlock. We're going to see him talk
about getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot him
saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no," slightly shrugging his shoulders. (Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy
to participate in one. I know that it's not possible
that this child could be mine, because of the timing of events. So I know it's not possible. Happy to take a paternity test,
and would love to see it happen. Interviewer: Are you going to do
that soon? Is there somebody -- JE: Well, I'm only one side.
I'm only one side of the test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM: Okay, those head shakes
are much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times
when someone makes one expression while masking another that just
kind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner
might shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with you
and then leak an expression of anger. And we're not all going to become
facial expression experts overnight here, but there's one I can teach you
that's very dangerous and it's easy to learn, and that's the expression of contempt. Now with anger, you've got
two people on an even playing field. It's still somewhat
of a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,
you've been dismissed. It's associated with moral superiority. And for that reason, it's very,
very hard to recover from. Here's what it looks like. It's marked by one lip corner
pulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt,
whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way,
go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you." Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures
all over the place all day long. They don't mean anything
in and of themselves. But when you see clusters

whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees
to believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point
you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying:
Lying's a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing
participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should
be kept secret, secret. We say, "Nice song." "Honey, you don't look fat in that, no." Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, "You know, I just fished
that email out of my Spam folder. So sorry." But there are times when we are unwilling
participants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone
in the United States. That's an eyelash
under a trillion dollars. That's seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case
of double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,
they can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths
of those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man, Henry Oberlander,
he was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermined the entire
banking system of the Western world. And you can't find this guy on Google;
you can't find him anywhere. He was interviewed once,
and he said the following. He said, "Look, I've got one rule." And this was Henry's rule, he said, "Look, everyone is willing
to give you something. They're ready to give you something
for whatever it is they're hungry for." And that's the crux of it. If you don't want to be
deceived, you have to know, what is it that you're hungry for? And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were
better husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were,
how we wish we could be, with what we're really like. And boy are we willing to fill in
those gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show
that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many of those are white lies. But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes
of meeting each other. (Laughter) Now when we first hear
this data, we recoil. We can't believe how prevalent lying is. We're essentially against lying. But if you look more closely,
the plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers
than we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves
than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're an average married couple, you're going to lie to your spouse
in one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried,
that number drops to three. Lying's complex. It's woven into the fabric
of our daily and our business lives. We're deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because
we don't understand the gaps in our lives. That's truth number two about lying. We're against lying, but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned
for centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture,
it's part of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare,
the Bible, News of the World. (Laughter) Lying has evolutionary value
to us as a species. Researchers have long known
that the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla
who was taught sign language? Koko was taught to communicate
via sign language. Here's Koko with her kitten. It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten
for ripping a sink out of the wall. (Laughter) We're hardwired to become
leaders of the pack. It's starts really, really early. How early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn concealment. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. Five-year-olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom
in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world
and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered
with Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls
a post-truth society. It's been very confusing
for a long time now. What do you do? Well, there are steps we can take
to navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth
90 percent of the time. The rest of us,
we're only 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes.
We all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to show you two patterns of deception. And then we're going
to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. (Video) Bill Clinton:
I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie,
not a single time, never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work
for the American people. Thank you. (Applause) Pamela Meyer: Okay,
what were the telltale signs? Well first we heard what's known
as a non-contracted denial. Studies show that people
who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather
than informal language. We also heard
distancing language: "that woman." We know that liars will unconsciously
distance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said,
"Well, to tell you the truth ..." or Richard Nixon's favorite,
"In all candor ..." he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language, as it's called,
qualifying language like that, further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated
the question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account
with a little too much detail -- and we're all really glad
he didn't do that -- he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said, look,
there's much more to it than speech: "No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent,
he chatters with his fingertips." And we all do it no matter
how powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I'm going to show you
Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips. (Laughter) Now this brings us to our next pattern,
which is body language. With body language,
here's what you've got to do. You've really got to just throw
your assumptions out the door. Let the science temper
your knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars
fidget all the time. Well guess what, they're known to freeze
their upper bodies when they're lying. We think liars won't look you in the eyes. Well guess what, they look
you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles
convey honesty, sincerity. But a trained liespotter
can spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contract
the muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile's in the eyes,
the crow's feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Don't overdo the Botox;
nobody will think you're honest. Now we're going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what's happening
in a conversation? Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words
and someone's actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you're having a conversation
with someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked
but telling of indicators. An honest person
is going to be cooperative. They're going to show
they're on your side. They're going to be enthusiastic. They're going to be willing and helpful
to getting you to the truth. They're going to be willing
to brainstorm, name suspects, provide details. They're going to say, "Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll
that forged those checks." They're going to be infuriated
if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course
of the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout
the entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen
to whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather
than lenient punishment. Now let's say you're having
that exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky. Ask a deceptive person
to tell their story, they're going to pepper it
with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they're going to tell their story
in strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways
over the course of several hours, they will ask that person
to tell that story backwards, and then they'll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce
the highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that?
Well, we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say "yes," we shake our heads "no." We tell very convincing stories,
we slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes, and we smile at the delight
in getting away with it. Now, that smile is known
in the trade as "duping delight." And we're going to see that
in several videos moving forward, but we're going to start --
for those of you who don't know him, this is presidential
candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering
a child out of wedlock. We're going to see him talk
about getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot him
saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no," slightly shrugging his shoulders. (Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy
to participate in one. I know that it's not possible
that this child could be mine, because of the timing of events. So I know it's not possible. Happy to take a paternity test,
and would love to see it happen. Interviewer: Are you going to do
that soon? Is there somebody -- JE: Well, I'm only one side.
I'm only one side of the test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM: Okay, those head shakes
are much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times
when someone makes one expression while masking another that just
kind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner
might shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with you
and then leak an expression of anger. And we're not all going to become
facial expression experts overnight here, but there's one I can teach you
that's very dangerous and it's easy to learn, and that's the expression of contempt. Now with anger, you've got
two people on an even playing field. It's still somewhat
of a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,
you've been dismissed. It's associated with moral superiority. And for that reason, it's very,
very hard to recover from. Here's what it looks like. It's marked by one lip corner
pulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt,
whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way,
go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you." Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures
all over the place all day long. They don't mean anything
in and of themselves. But when you see clusters
of them, that's your signal. Look, listen, probe,
ask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable
mode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode,
ask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person
you're talking to with rapport. Don't try to be like those folks
on "Law & Order" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects
into submission. Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work. Now, we've talked a little bit
about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised, we're now going
to look at what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying,
one is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher
David Matsumoto in California. And I think they're an excellent example
of what the truth looks like. This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital
while they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it. And you'll see when you see the video, she can't even pretend
to be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here
is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes
and her very, very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you'll see
duping delight throughout this video. (Video) Diane Downs:
At night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reaching
her hand out to me while I'm driving, and the blood just kept
coming out of her mouth. And that -- maybe
it'll fade too with time -- but I don't think so. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother,
Erin Runnion, confronting her daughter's murderer
and torturer in court. Here you're going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression
of a mother's agony. (Video) Erin Runnion:
I wrote this statement on the third anniversary
of the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought, and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you
with those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her. And I don't understand it, and I never will. PM: Okay, there's no doubting
the veracity of those emotions. Now the technology
around what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it. We know, for example, that we now have specialized eye trackers
and infrared brain scans, MRI's that can decode the signals
that our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going
to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove
incredibly useful some day. But you've got to ask yourself
in the meantime: Who do you want on your side
of the meeting, someone who's trained
in getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag
a 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door? Liespotters rely on human tools. They know, as someone once said, "Character's who you are in the dark." And what's kind of interesting
is that today, we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 24 hours a day. It's transparent
with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz
of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live
their lives in public. It's a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, that's not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting
can blind us to the fact that the subtleties
of human decency -- character integrity -- that's still what matters,
that's always what's going to matter. So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit
about our moral code. When you combine the science
of recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself
from collaborating in a lie. You start up that path
of being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, "Hey, my world, our world,
it's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be
one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized
and marginalized." And when you do that, the ground around you starts
to shift just a little bit. And that's the truth. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Okay, now I don't want
to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention
that the person to your right is a liar. (Laughter) Also, the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting
in your very seats is a liar. We're all liars. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research
says about why we're all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want
to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building. Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrote
this book, "Liespotting," no one wants to meet me in person
anymore, no, no, no, no, no. They say, "It's okay, we'll email you." (Laughter) I can't even get
a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like, "Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking.
How about French cooking?" So before I get started,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room
that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.
You flared your nostril. I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'
I know you're lying." No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge
of how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature
leaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations
with difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees

I'm only one side of the test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM: Okay, those head shakes
are much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times
when someone makes one expression while masking another that just
kind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner
might shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with you
and then leak an expression of anger. And we're not all going to become
facial expression experts overnight here, but there's one I can teach you
that's very dangerous and it's easy to learn, and that's the expression of contempt. Now with anger, you've got
two people on an even playing field. It's still somewhat
of a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,
you've been dismissed. It's associated with moral superiority. And for that reason, it's very,
very hard to recover from. Here's what it looks like. It's marked by one lip corner
pulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt,
whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way,
go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you." Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures
all over the place all day long. They don't mean anything
in and of themselves. But when you see clusters
of them, that's your signal. Look, listen, probe,
ask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable
mode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode,
ask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person
you're talking to with rapport. Don't try to be like those folks
on "Law & Order" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects
into submission. Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work. Now, we've talked a little bit
about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised, we're now going
to look at what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying,
one is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher
David Matsumoto in California. And I think they're an excellent example
of what the truth looks like. This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital
while they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it. And you'll see when you see the video, she can't even pretend
to be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here
is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes
and her very, very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you'll see
duping delight throughout this video. (Video) Diane Downs:
At night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reaching
her hand out to me while I'm driving, and the blood just kept
coming out of her mouth. And that -- maybe
it'll fade too with time -- but I don't think so. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother,
Erin Runnion, confronting her daughter's murderer
and torturer in court. Here you're going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression
of a mother's agony. (Video) Erin Runnion:
I wrote this statement on the third anniversary
of the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought, and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you
with those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her. And I don't understand it, and I never will. PM: Okay, there's no doubting
the veracity of those emotions. Now the technology
around what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it. We know, for example, that we now have specialized eye trackers
and infrared brain scans, MRI's that can decode the signals
that our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going
to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove
incredibly useful some day. But you've got to ask yourself
in the meantime: Who do you want on your side
of the meeting, someone who's trained
in getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag
a 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door? Liespotters rely on human tools. They know, as someone once said, "Character's who you are in the dark." And what's kind of interesting
is that today, we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 24 hours a day. It's transparent
with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz
of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live
their lives in public. It's a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, that's not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting
can blind us to the fact that the subtleties
of human decency -- character integrity -- that's still what matters,
that's always what's going to matter. So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit
about our moral code. When you combine the science
of recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself
from collaborating in a lie. You start up that path
of being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, "Hey, my world, our world,
it's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be
one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized
and marginalized." And when you do that, the ground around you starts
to shift just a little bit. And that's the truth. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
When a new pathogen emerges, our bodies and healthcare systems
are left vulnerable. In times like these,
there’s an urgent need for a vaccine to create widespread immunity
with minimal loss of life. So how quickly can we develop vaccines
when we need them most? Vaccine development can generally 
be split into three phases. In exploratory research, scientists 
experiment with different approaches to find safe and replicable 
vaccine designs. Once these are vetted in the lab, 
they enter clinical testing, where vaccines are evaluated 
for safety, efficacy, and side effects across a variety of populations. Finally, there’s manufacturing, where vaccines are produced 
and distributed for public use. Under regular circumstances, this process
takes an average of 15 to 20 years. But during a pandemic, 
researchers employ numerous strategies to move through each stage 
as quickly as possible. Exploratory research is perhaps 
the most flexible. The goal of this stage 
is to find a safe way to introduce our immune system 
to the virus or bacteria. This gives our body the information
it needs to create antibodies capable of fighting a real infection. There are many ways to safely trigger
this immune response, but generally, the most effective 
designs are also the slowest to produce. Traditional attenuated vaccines 
create long lasting resilience. But they rely on weakened viral strains that must be cultivated in non-human
tissue over long periods of time. Inactivated vaccines take 
a much faster approach, directly applying heat, acid, or radiation
to weaken the pathogen. Sub-unit vaccines, that inject 
harmless fragments of viral proteins, can also be created quickly. But these faster techniques produce
less robust resilience. These are just three 
of many vaccine designs, each with their own pros and cons. No single approach is guaranteed to work, and all of them require 
time-consuming research. So the best way to speed things up 
is for many labs to work on different models 
simultaneously. This race-to-the-finish strategy produced the first testable 
Zika vaccine in 7 months, and the first testable COVID-19 vaccine
in just 42 days. Being testable doesn’t mean 
these vaccines will be successful. But models that are deemed safe 
and easily replicable can move into clinical testing while other
labs continue exploring alternatives. Whether a testable vaccine is produced
in four months or four years, the next stage is often the longest and 
most unpredictable stage of development. Clinical testing consists of three phases,
each containing multiple trials. Phase I trials focus on the intensity 
of the triggered immune response, and try to establish that the vaccine 
is safe and effective. Phase II trials focus on determining 
the right dosage and delivery schedule across a wider population. And Phase III trials determine safety across the vaccine’s primary 
use population, while also identifying rare side effects
and negative reactions. Given the number of variables 
and the focus on long-term safety, it’s incredibly difficult to speed up 
clinical testing. In extreme circumstances, 
researchers run multiple trials within one phase at the same time. But they still need to meet 
strict safety criteria before moving on. Occasionally, labs can expedite 
this process by leveraging previously approved treatments. In 2009, researchers adapted 
the seasonal flu vaccine to treat H1N1— producing a widely available vaccine
in just six months. However, this technique only works
when dealing with familiar pathogens that have well-established 
vaccine designs. After a successful Phase III trial, 
a national regulatory authority reviews the results and approves 
safe vaccines for manufacturing. Every vaccine has a unique blend 
of biological and chemical components that require a specialized pipeline 
to produce. To start production as soon 
as the vaccine is approved, manufacturing plans must be designed
in parallel to research and testing. This requires constant coordination
between labs and manufacturers, as well as the resources to adapt
to sudden changes in vaccine design— even if that means scrapping
months of work. Over time, advances in exploratory
research and manufacturing should make this process faster. Preliminary studies suggest 
that future researchers may be able to swap genetic material
from different viruses into the same vaccine design. These DNA and mRNA based vaccines
could dramatically expedite all three stages of vaccine production. But until such breakthroughs arrive, our best strategy is for labs 
around the world to cooperate and work in parallel 
on different approaches. By sharing knowledge and resources, scientists can divide and conquer 
any pathogen.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although Question 8 does not directly mention applying acid as part of the inactivated vaccine process, it does compare traditional attenuated vaccines to inactivated/sub-unit vaccines in terms of production time and resilience, which is related to the content of the ground truth MCQ. However, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the methods used in inactivated vaccines, such as applying acid, heat, or radiation. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Therefore, while not a perfect match, Question 8 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
When a new pathogen emerges, our bodies and healthcare systems
are left vulnerable. In times like these,
there’s an urgent need for a vaccine to create widespread immunity
with minimal loss of life. So how quickly can we develop vaccines
when we need them most? Vaccine development can generally 
be split into three phases. In exploratory research, scientists 
experiment with different approaches to find safe and replicable 
vaccine designs. Once these are vetted in the lab, 
they enter clinical testing, where vaccines are evaluated 
for safety, efficacy, and side effects across a variety of populations. Finally, there’s manufacturing, where vaccines are produced 
and distributed for public use. Under regular circumstances, this process
takes an average of 15 to 20 years. But during a pandemic, 
researchers employ numerous strategies to move through each stage 
as quickly as possible. Exploratory research is perhaps 
the most flexible. The goal of this stage 
is to find a safe way to introduce our immune system 
to the virus or bacteria. This gives our body the information
it needs to create antibodies capable of fighting a real infection. There are many ways to safely trigger
this immune response, but generally, the most effective 
designs are also the slowest to produce. Traditional attenuated vaccines 
create long lasting resilience. But they rely on weakened viral strains that must be cultivated in non-human
tissue over long periods of time. Inactivated vaccines take 
a much faster approach, directly applying heat, acid, or radiation
to weaken the pathogen. Sub-unit vaccines, that inject 
harmless fragments of viral proteins, can also be created quickly. But these faster techniques produce
less robust resilience. These are just three 
of many vaccine designs, each with their own pros and cons. No single approach is guaranteed to work, and all of them require 
time-consuming research. So the best way to speed things up 
is for many labs to work on different models 
simultaneously. This race-to-the-finish strategy produced the first testable 
Zika vaccine in 7 months, and the first testable COVID-19 vaccine
in just 42 days. Being testable doesn’t mean 
these vaccines will be successful. But models that are deemed safe 
and easily replicable can move into clinical testing while other
labs continue exploring alternatives. Whether a testable vaccine is produced
in four months or four years, the next stage is often the longest and 
most unpredictable stage of development. Clinical testing consists of three phases,
each containing multiple trials. Phase I trials focus on the intensity 
of the triggered immune response, and try to establish that the vaccine 
is safe and effective. Phase II trials focus on determining 
the right dosage and delivery schedule across a wider population. And Phase III trials determine safety across the vaccine’s primary 
use population, while also identifying rare side effects
and negative reactions. Given the number of variables 
and the focus on long-term safety, it’s incredibly difficult to speed up 
clinical testing. In extreme circumstances, 
researchers run multiple trials within one phase at the same time. But they still need to meet 
strict safety criteria before moving on. Occasionally, labs can expedite 
this process by leveraging previously approved treatments. In 2009, researchers adapted 
the seasonal flu vaccine to treat H1N1— producing a widely available vaccine
in just six months. However, this technique only works
when dealing with familiar pathogens that have well-established 
vaccine designs. After a successful Phase III trial, 
a national regulatory authority reviews the results and approves 
safe vaccines for manufacturing. Every vaccine has a unique blend 
of biological and chemical components that require a specialized pipeline 
to produce. To start production as soon 
as the vaccine is approved, manufacturing plans must be designed
in parallel to research and testing. This requires constant coordination
between labs and manufacturers, as well as the resources to adapt
to sudden changes in vaccine design— even if that means scrapping
months of work. Over time, advances in exploratory
research and manufacturing should make this process faster. Preliminary studies suggest 
that future researchers may be able to swap genetic material
from different viruses into the same vaccine design. These DNA and mRNA based vaccines
could dramatically expedite all three stages of vaccine production. But until such breakthroughs arrive, our best strategy is for labs 
around the world to cooperate and work in parallel 
on different approaches. By sharing knowledge and resources, scientists can divide and conquer 
any pathogen.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar.

Although Question 1 does not specifically ask about the H1N1 vaccine, it does ask about the average time required for vaccine development, which is related to the topic of vaccine production time.

However, a more relevant question that could match the ground truth MCQ is not present among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that the closest match is not available, but if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 8, which talks about the production time of different vaccine types, but it does not specifically mention H1N1.

But since I have to provide an index, I will provide the index of the question that is most relevant to vaccine production time, which is Question 8.

Index: 8

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it refers to the green color group instead of the blue and purple color group and does not ask about the specific vitamin used to help the body.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the blue and purple color group and the vitamin or nutrient associated with it. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the provided generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose the closest match, I would say Question 2, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

But since it is referring to another group, then I will choose none, but I can see that Question 2 has the closest type of question.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the color group concept, I would choose Question 1, which asks about the blue and purple color group. However, this is still not a direct match.

If I were to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

Options: A. Ginger, B. Jicama, C. Mushroom, D. Onion, E. All of the above

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4, but it's about the life cycle of a frog. However, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, which is about the life cycle of a plant.

A more suitable match would be Question 1, but it only asks about the process of germination, which is the first stage of a plant's life cycle.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it's Question 3, but it's about the life cycle of a bird, not a plant. However, if we consider the structure and intent of the question, we can see that Question 3 is asking about the main stages in the life cycle of a bird, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that there isn't a perfect match among the generated MCQs.

That being said, I will choose Question 3 as the most similar, but please note that it's not about plants, it's about birds.

**Transcript**:
[Music] Picture a polar bear...in the desert. No, what you're imagining is way too cute. Take off the sunglasses and the swim trunks. There. He's hot. He's hungry. He's downright miserable. Why is he such a grumpy bear? Well, it's because he's not where he belongs. There aren't any tasty seals to eat, 
no cold water to enjoy, and no snow to sleep in. The desert isn't his habitat. You know that a habitat is 
the area where something lives, but from polar bears to porcupines, 
animals don't just need a place to live -- they also rely on the other living and 
non-living things around them to survive. And life looks different in 
different places around the world. So, what makes a habitat a home? Well, what do you need? I need sandwiches, pancakes, 
carrots, maybe some nice peaches... so I need food, and I need water. 
I need a place to live. And I need a place to film Crash Course videos. You could say this is my habitat. Animals need these things, too! Food, water, shelter, and space to live. For animals, their food comes 
from their neighbors, the other living things in their habitat. You know that plants and animals all 
fall somewhere along the food chain, which is a model we use to describe 
the flow of energy between living things. But the real world is made up of 
lots and lots of food chains, and those chains can get kind of messy. I mean, look at our polar bear. Sure, 
his favorite food is seal, but in a pinch, he'll eat walrus, dead whales, bird's eggs, 
and if he has absolutely no other choice, plants. The polar bear is at the top of 
multiple food chains, and that's not unusual -- most animals 
don't just eat one thing, and neither do I. I'm at the top of the pancake food 
chain and the carrot food chain. It just so happens I prefer pancakes. So, you can see how food chains are actually 
all tangled around with each other, with many different ones overlapping, 
kind of like a web. So, we call this a "food web." Food webs are big, tangled systems that include 
every plant and animal in a habitat. And, as you might guess, 
all food webs are different. Let's compare two different habitats 
to see how the food webs play out. First, we'll go back to our old stomping ground: the forest. Let's begin with (you know
 this, people!) the plants: trees, grass, and other plants that 
change energy from the sun into sugar. But then you have some animals 
that eat other animals. This is where things get a little more complicated. Today, an owl makes a mouse his lunch,
but tomorrow it may be a rabbit. Today, a snake snacks on a squirrel, 
but a few days later, our owl friend might make a meal of 
another meat eater, like the snake. Finally, the decomposers: 
insects, fungi, and bacteria are breaking down whatever's left over --
from uneaten, rotten fruit to leftover animal carcasses. As they break down matter, they provide more nutrients for the plants. It's a bit of a different story up in 
the Arctic. I mean, look at all that ice! I know what you're thinking: 
where are the plants? How do we have a food web without plants? Zoom in on the sea water. 
Zoom way in-- further, further, stop! Can you see those tiny plants? 
They're called phytoplankton. And just like plants on land, 
they convert energy from the sun. Really small creatures called zooplankton 
eat the phytoplankton. And all kinds of small fish 
dine on the zooplankton. Larger fish eat the smaller fish. There are big marine mammals, too. Beluga whales eat fish, while humpback whales 
eat the tiny plankton and krill. And what else eats fish? Seals. 
That's our polar bear's favorite food, but up here, you can't afford to be picky, so he may 
have to nibble on some whale carcass if necessary. As for decomposers, there aren't many 
bugs or earthworms in this cold climate. There are bacteria, but since it's so cold, the decomposers break down matter 
much more slowly than in the forest. So, you can see, food webs 
and the ecosystems that support them look different in different parts of the world, depending on the habitat conditions. Flat or mountainous land, 
more or less water... these seemingly small changes in habitats 
affect what kind of plants and animals live there. Up in the Arctic, a polar bear has the right conditions to keep him happy. First, he fits into his food web perfectly. The food that's available to him has enough 
fat and protein to keep his energy up. Second, he fits into his habitat perfectly. He has the body adaptations to not just survive, 
but feel really comfortable in the super cold. A polar bear isn't built to survive 
in the desert or the forest. So, let's put our poor polar bear 
back where he belongs. I was starting to feel bad for the guy!

**Transcript**:
[Music] Picture a polar bear...in the desert. No, what you're imagining is way too cute. Take off the sunglasses and the swim trunks. There. He's hot. He's hungry. He's downright miserable. Why is he such a grumpy bear? Well, it's because he's not where he belongs. There aren't any tasty seals to eat, 
no cold water to enjoy, and no snow to sleep in. The desert isn't his habitat. You know that a habitat is 
the area where something lives, but from polar bears to porcupines, 
animals don't just need a place to live -- they also rely on the other living and 
non-living things around them to survive. And life looks different in 
different places around the world. So, what makes a habitat a home? Well, what do you need? I need sandwiches, pancakes, 
carrots, maybe some nice peaches... so I need food, and I need water. 
I need a place to live. And I need a place to film Crash Course videos. You could say this is my habitat. Animals need these things, too! Food, water, shelter, and space to live. For animals, their food comes 
from their neighbors, the other living things in their habitat. You know that plants and animals all 
fall somewhere along the food chain, which is a model we use to describe 
the flow of energy between living things. But the real world is made up of 
lots and lots of food chains, and those chains can get kind of messy. I mean, look at our polar bear. Sure, 
his favorite food is seal, but in a pinch, he'll eat walrus, dead whales, bird's eggs, 
and if he has absolutely no other choice, plants. The polar bear is at the top of 
multiple food chains, and that's not unusual -- most animals 
don't just eat one thing, and neither do I. I'm at the top of the pancake food 
chain and the carrot food chain. It just so happens I prefer pancakes. So, you can see how food chains are actually 
all tangled around with each other, with many different ones overlapping, 
kind of like a web. So, we call this a "food web." Food webs are big, tangled systems that include 
every plant and animal in a habitat. And, as you might guess, 
all food webs are different. Let's compare two different habitats 
to see how the food webs play out. First, we'll go back to our old stomping ground: the forest. Let's begin with (you know
 this, people!) the plants: trees, grass, and other plants that 
change energy from the sun into sugar. But then you have some animals 
that eat other animals. This is where things get a little more complicated. Today, an owl makes a mouse his lunch,
but tomorrow it may be a rabbit. Today, a snake snacks on a squirrel, 
but a few days later, our owl friend might make a meal of 
another meat eater, like the snake. Finally, the decomposers: 
insects, fungi, and bacteria are breaking down whatever's left over --
from uneaten, rotten fruit to leftover animal carcasses. As they break down matter, they provide more nutrients for the plants. It's a bit of a different story up in 
the Arctic. I mean, look at all that ice! I know what you're thinking: 
where are the plants? How do we have a food web without plants? Zoom in on the sea water. 
Zoom way in-- further, further, stop! Can you see those tiny plants? 
They're called phytoplankton. And just like plants on land, 
they convert energy from the sun. Really small creatures called zooplankton 
eat the phytoplankton. And all kinds of small fish 
dine on the zooplankton. Larger fish eat the smaller fish. There are big marine mammals, too. Beluga whales eat fish, while humpback whales 
eat the tiny plankton and krill. And what else eats fish? Seals. 
That's our polar bear's favorite food, but up here, you can't afford to be picky, so he may 
have to nibble on some whale carcass if necessary. As for decomposers, there aren't many 
bugs or earthworms in this cold climate. There are bacteria, but since it's so cold, the decomposers break down matter 
much more slowly than in the forest. So, you can see, food webs 
and the ecosystems that support them look different in different parts of the world, depending on the habitat conditions. Flat or mountainous land, 
more or less water... these seemingly small changes in habitats 
affect what kind of plants and animals live there. Up in the Arctic, a polar bear has the right conditions to keep him happy. First, he fits into his food web perfectly. The food that's available to him has enough 
fat and protein to keep his energy up. Second, he fits into his habitat perfectly. He has the body adaptations to not just survive, 
but feel really comfortable in the super cold. A polar bear isn't built to survive 
in the desert or the forest. So, let's put our poor polar bear 
back where he belongs. I was starting to feel bad for the guy!

**Transcript**:
[music] We all know that we have to eat different
kinds of food to get the nutrition that we need. So eating plants is a great idea if you want
to be healthy. That’s why I like to eat things like carrots, and spinach and tomatoes. I like to eat plants, but what if plants...
tried to eat animals? Well, there are actually a few kinds of plants
that are carnivorous, meaning they eat meat. Now when I say meat, I’m not talking about
chicken nuggets or hamburgers. I’m talking about really small animals,
like insects, spiders, and frogs. Creatures like these have to be extra careful
around meat-eating plants! Probably the most famous carnivorous plant
is known as the Venus Flytrap. Venus Flytraps have leaves at the tops of
their stems that kind of look like tiny, toothy mouths. They’re not really mouths, but they serve
the same purpose: to eat flies, and other insects. Usually, the trap’s leaves are wide open.
And the inside of the trap smells like food to insects. So they fly or crawl right into
it, looking for a meal. But if they aren’t careful, they become
the meal instead. On each half of the trap, there are three
tiny hairs. If an insect touches two of those hairs, the trap shuts, and the slender spines
around the edges of the leaves close together tightly,  trapping the insect inside. Then the trap slowly digests its meal, meaning
it breaks its food down into smaller pieces. It’s too bad for that little insect, but
it will provide energy for that plant to live. And Venus Flytraps aren’t the only kind
of carnivorous plant. Some plants, called sundews, attract bugs
with colorful red and green leaves that are covered with a sweet, sticky “dew” that
sparkles in the sunlight. The thing is, this dew acts like a kind of
glue. Any bug that lands on its leaves looking for
a meal will get stuck. And soon the plant just starts digesting it, soaking up nutrients
from the bug’s body right through the leaves. Now, some other carnivorous plants can consume
even bigger prey. Pitcher plants, for example, have big, brightly
colored leaves, curled up into the shape of a tube. At the bottom of the tube sits a little pool
of sweet liquid called nectar. Once again, lots of different creatures are drawn to its
tasty smell. They creep, crawl, jump, or fly to the edge
of the tube to see what’s in there to eat. But the top is really slippery, and there
are stiff hairs all along the inside of the tube pointing down -- so once a creature starts
to fall in, they can’t get out. This clever kind of trap has allowed pitcher
plants to catch not just bugs,  but also make meals of small frogs and even mice! And finally, there are some meat-eating plants
that don’t even live on land. Bladderworts, for example, live and catch
their prey in water. These plants have tiny containers on their
stems called bladders that float underwater. Each bladder has an opening with a tiny flap
on it, that can open and close, like a hidden trapdoor. When insects, like water fleas, trigger tiny
hairs near the trapdoor, the door swings open, and sucks the little creature in. So now you know -- certain plants sometimes
eat animals. Like I said, it’s nice to have variety in
your diet! Thanks for watching SciShow Kids. Till next
time! [music]

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks which of the following is NOT a carnivorous plant, with options A. Venus Flytrap, B. Sundew, C. Pitcher Plants, and D. None of the above. All of these plants are carnivorous.

A generated MCQ that is somewhat related to this question is:

Question 2: Which carnivorous plant is known for its leaves that resemble tiny, toothy mouths? Options: A. Pitcher Plant, B. Sundew, C. Venus Flytrap, D. Bladderwort

Although this question does not ask which plant is NOT carnivorous, it does ask about a specific characteristic of a carnivorous plant, which is related to the topic of carnivorous plants.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say:

 Question 8: What is an advantage of being a carnivorous plant? Options: A. Having a reduced ability to capture prey, B. Being able to obtain energy from the sun, C. Being able to thrive in nutrient-poor soil, D. Having a limited range of adaptations

is not similar but one of the option in the ground truth MCQ "None of the above. All of these plants are carnivorous" can be linked with the fact that all plants in the options provided for this question 8 can be carnivorous.

However the best match is 

 Question 5, it has the name of the carnivorous plants but it is not asking which one is not a carnivorous plant 

But among the generated MCQ the one with an index of 5 has more names of the carnivorous plant mentioned in the options of the ground truth MCQ

[music] We all know that we have to eat different
kinds of food to get the nutrition that we need. So eating plants is a great idea if you want
to be healthy. That’s why I like to eat things like carrots, and spinach and tomatoes. I like to eat plants, but what if plants...
tried to eat animals? Well, there are actually a few kinds of plants
that are carnivorous, meaning they eat meat. Now when I say meat, I’m not talking about
chicken nuggets or hamburgers. I’m talking about really small animals,
like insects, spiders, and frogs. Creatures like these have to be extra careful
around meat-eating plants! Probably the most famous carnivorous plant
is known as the Venus Flytrap. Venus Flytraps have leaves at the tops of
their stems that kind of look like tiny, toothy mouths. They’re not really mouths, but they serve
the same purpose: to eat flies, and other insects. Usually, the trap’s leaves are wide open.
And the inside of the trap smells like food to insects. So they fly or crawl right into
it, looking for a meal. But if they aren’t careful, they become
the meal instead. On each half of the trap, there are three
tiny hairs. If an insect touches two of those hairs, the trap shuts, and the slender spines
around the edges of the leaves close together tightly,  trapping the insect inside. Then the trap slowly digests its meal, meaning
it breaks its food down into smaller pieces. It’s too bad for that little insect, but
it will provide energy for that plant to live. And Venus Flytraps aren’t the only kind
of carnivorous plant. Some plants, called sundews, attract bugs
with colorful red and green leaves that are covered with a sweet, sticky “dew” that
sparkles in the sunlight. The thing is, this dew acts like a kind of
glue. Any bug that lands on its leaves looking for
a meal will get stuck. And soon the plant just starts digesting it, soaking up nutrients
from the bug’s body right through the leaves. Now, some other carnivorous plants can consume
even bigger prey. Pitcher plants, for example, have big, brightly
colored leaves, curled up into the shape of a tube. At the bottom of the tube sits a little pool
of sweet liquid called nectar. Once again, lots of different creatures are drawn to its
tasty smell. They creep, crawl, jump, or fly to the edge
of the tube to see what’s in there to eat. But the top is really slippery, and there
are stiff hairs all along the inside of the tube pointing down -- so once a creature starts
to fall in, they can’t get out. This clever kind of trap has allowed pitcher
plants to catch not just bugs,  but also make meals of small frogs and even mice! And finally, there are some meat-eating plants
that don’t even live on land. Bladderworts, for example, live and catch
their prey in water. These plants have tiny containers on their
stems called bladders that float underwater. Each bladder has an opening with a tiny flap
on it, that can open and close, like a hidden trapdoor. When insects, like water fleas, trigger tiny
hairs near the trapdoor, the door swings open, and sucks the little creature in. So now you know -- certain plants sometimes
eat animals. Like I said, it’s nice to have variety in
your diet! Thanks for watching SciShow Kids. Till next

[INTRO ♪] So you’re in line at the grocery store,
and there’s a parent holding a baby right in front of you. You’re minding your own business, but when
you look up, that baby just won’t stop staring at you
like you’re the most interesting thing on the planet. You might feel like you’ve grown a second
head, or like you have chocolate smeared all over
your mouth, but in reality, that baby just likes looking
at your face. Because there’s a lot to figure out there! From very early in life, babies seem to like
looking at faces, or even just configurations of shapes that
look like faces. They also prefer faces they recognize to ones
they don’t, but they’ll sometimes spend a little more
time looking at strangers because they’re new or different. Faces are important to babies because they’re
basically completely helpless and have to rely on their
caregivers to survive. They need to be able to find and communicate
with the people who feed them and change their diapers, and knowing what they look like is an important
part of that. Even if said communication just involves screaming
at the top of their lungs for a while. Babies are also busy taking in huge amounts
of information to help them understand the world, and faces
can teach them a lot. From our expressions to how our mouths form
words, a lot of our communication as humans happens
through our faces. In those first few months of life, babies
are not only beginning to learn how to recognize their parents or grandparents, but also about all the emotions conveyed by
facial expressions. There’s a lot to learn! So when a baby is staring at you in the grocery
store, her little brain is probably trying to figure
if she knows you and what categories your face fits into, like
if you’re happy or sad. Now, babies might be born ready to learn from
the world around them, but there’s still some question about whether
looking at faces is an innate characteristic— one you’re born with—or if it’s influenced
by experience. And, like with a lot of the age-old, nature
versus nurture debate, it’s a little bit of both. On the nature side, there’s some evidence
that, within hours to days of being born, babies can copy facial expressions they see,
like if you stick out your tongue at them. Not all studies agree with those results,
but it’s possible that there’s an innate ability for finding and mimicking
expressions. Other research has found that within hours
of birth, babies can discriminate between their mother’s
face and a stranger’s, which might mean their brain is ready to recognize
faces without much information. So, some evidence suggests that babies may
be predisposed to look for information from faces right when
they’re born. But other studies have shown that it takes
experience to get really good at it. Either way, all the time babies and their
caregivers spend looking at each other causes rapid improvement in babies’ abilities
to process and recognize faces. Starting around 3 months old, they even begin
to group different kinds of faces— like human versus animals and kids versus
adults. One especially cool study had babies and adults
look at a series of different monkey faces, and also at a bunch of different adult human
faces. They found that 6-month-old babies are actually
better at differentiating between monkey faces than
adults are! But when they’re about 9 months old, that
ability goes away because of what’s called perceptual narrowing, where their perception starts to change based
on their experience. Basically, the baby learns that paying attention
to the differences in human faces is way more important for its life than the
differences in monkey faces, so it should focus more on humans than monkeys. As the brain develops over time, the pathways
used to recognize human faces get more efficient, and the ones
for monkeys get pruned away. But when researchers expose babies to lots
of monkey faces between when they’re 6 and 9 months old, they effectively teach their brains that monkeys
are important to pay attention to, so they keep that ability for a lot longer. Even though babies are born with some skills, experience helps tell them what parts of the
world they should pay attention to, and that shapes how their brain’s perception
and recognition systems develop. So, it’s a little bit of nature and a little
bit of nurture that goes into that cute, big-eyed baby staring
at you. And yeah, in that moment, your face might
just be the most interesting thing on the planet. But don’t rule out the possibility that
you might have a little chocolate on your face, too. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although the correct option in the ground truth MCQ is A (6 months), and the correct option in the generated MCQ is B (Around 3 months old), both questions have the same intent and content, which is to ask about the age when babies start grouping different kinds of faces.

However, it's worth noting that the correct answer according to the transcript is actually around 3 months old, not 6 months. The transcript states: "Starting around 3 months old, they even begin to group different kinds of faces— like human versus animals and kids versus adults." 

So, the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ seems to be incorrect based on the provided transcript, and the generated MCQ (Question 1) is actually more accurate.

**Transcript**:
[INTRO ♪] So you’re in line at the grocery store,
and there’s a parent holding a baby right in front of you. You’re minding your own business, but when
you look up, that baby just won’t stop staring at you
like you’re the most interesting thing on the planet. You might feel like you’ve grown a second
head, or like you have chocolate smeared all over
your mouth, but in reality, that baby just likes looking
at your face. Because there’s a lot to figure out there! From very early in life, babies seem to like
looking at faces, or even just configurations of shapes that
look like faces. They also prefer faces they recognize to ones
they don’t, but they’ll sometimes spend a little more
time looking at strangers because they’re new or different. Faces are important to babies because they’re
basically completely helpless and have to rely on their
caregivers to survive. They need to be able to find and communicate
with the people who feed them and change their diapers, and knowing what they look like is an important
part of that. Even if said communication just involves screaming
at the top of their lungs for a while. Babies are also busy taking in huge amounts
of information to help them understand the world, and faces
can teach them a lot. From our expressions to how our mouths form
words, a lot of our communication as humans happens
through our faces. In those first few months of life, babies
are not only beginning to learn how to recognize their parents or grandparents, but also about all the emotions conveyed by
facial expressions. There’s a lot to learn! So when a baby is staring at you in the grocery
store, her little brain is probably trying to figure
if she knows you and what categories your face fits into, like
if you’re happy or sad. Now, babies might be born ready to learn from
the world around them, but there’s still some question about whether
looking at faces is an innate characteristic— one you’re born with—or if it’s influenced
by experience. And, like with a lot of the age-old, nature
versus nurture debate, it’s a little bit of both. On the nature side, there’s some evidence
that, within hours to days of being born, babies can copy facial expressions they see,
like if you stick out your tongue at them. Not all studies agree with those results,
but it’s possible that there’s an innate ability for finding and mimicking
expressions. Other research has found that within hours
of birth, babies can discriminate between their mother’s
face and a stranger’s, which might mean their brain is ready to recognize
faces without much information. So, some evidence suggests that babies may
be predisposed to look for information from faces right when
they’re born. But other studies have shown that it takes
experience to get really good at it. Either way, all the time babies and their
caregivers spend looking at each other causes rapid improvement in babies’ abilities
to process and recognize faces. Starting around 3 months old, they even begin
to group different kinds of faces— like human versus animals and kids versus
adults. One especially cool study had babies and adults
look at a series of different monkey faces, and also at a bunch of different adult human
faces. They found that 6-month-old babies are actually
better at differentiating between monkey faces than
adults are! But when they’re about 9 months old, that
ability goes away because of what’s called perceptual narrowing, where their perception starts to change based
on their experience. Basically, the baby learns that paying attention
to the differences in human faces is way more important for its life than the
differences in monkey faces, so it should focus more on humans than monkeys. As the brain develops over time, the pathways
used to recognize human faces get more efficient, and the ones
for monkeys get pruned away. But when researchers expose babies to lots
of monkey faces between when they’re 6 and 9 months old, they effectively teach their brains that monkeys
are important to pay attention to, so they keep that ability for a lot longer. Even though babies are born with some skills, experience helps tell them what parts of the
world they should pay attention to, and that shapes how their brain’s perception
and recognition systems develop. So, it’s a little bit of nature and a little
bit of nurture that goes into that cute, big-eyed baby staring
at you. And yeah, in that moment, your face might
just be the most interesting thing on the planet. But don’t rule out the possibility that
you might have a little chocolate on your face, too. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow

[Music] you might know of dyslexia as a reading disorder or that one condition that makes letters seem to float around on the page and that's understandable because it does mess with people's ability to read but it's more complex than letters flipping around and floating away years of research suggests that people with dyslexia might struggle with processing letters because they also have trouble processing of all things rhythm people with dyslexia tend to read more slowly than others misspelled words or confuse letters that look similar and the disorder is far from being uncommon most estimates say it affects at least 1 in 10 people but despite its impacts on reading dyslexia may actually be caused at least in part by something more Musical whether you realize it or not language has a whole lot of rhythm whole lotta rhythm a whole lotta rhythm a whole lot of rhythm a whole lotta rhythm just like that and I'm not talking about like beat boxing or slam poetry or whatever I just did I'm talking about everyday speech think about it like this if you say a word like difficult there's a right way to stress and pitch those sounds difficult is right and difficult just it sounds kind of weird this rhythm that's built into language is known as prosody most people have no trouble processing it they do it without even thinking but a study published in 2011 showed that people with dyslexia tend to have a harder time with this they're much less able to tell if a miss stressed word is pronounced right or wrong and if you have trouble parsing the rhythmic stress patterns and words that can make it extra tricky to match letters to the sounds of words in other words if you don't have a good internal representation of what the word is supposed to sound like when you read something there are fewer clues to help you link letters on the page to the meaning of the word scientists believe this might happen because of differences in the way dyslexic brains sample sound according to the theory of temporal sampling as sensory information like speech enters your brain your brain takes snapshots of that information so it doesn't just absorb information continuously it takes a bunch of snapshots at different rates some quicker than others and it uses those snapshots to put together an image or in this case an auditory representation of the signals it's receiving if we stick with the camera metaphor for a sec you can imagine the brain as a camera trying to take a picture of a hummingbird a non dyslexic brain is like a camera with a fast shutter speed it captures a clear moment in time even though the hummingbirds wings are beating really quickly on the other hand a dyslexic brain is more like a camera with a slower shutter speed so instead of capturing the wings clearly it captures a blur in the real world what that means is that sometimes a dyslexic brain doesn't process rhythmic information as fast as it's arriving as a result someone with dyslexia may not lock into rhythms and language as well as someone without dyslexia the difference or at least one of them seems to be in a part of the brain called the arcuate fasciculus which is a kind of connective highway between parts of the brain involved in language and those with dyslexia the arcuate fasciculus is smaller with less white matter to carry information and the fewer connections the harder it becomes to pass information around those language areas along with its role in language the arcuate fasciculus is also really important for music in fact there's some evidence that people with dyslexia could make use of this connection between language and music to improve their reading skills a 2016 study used what's called cognitive musical training or CMT on two groups of children between 8 and 12 years old 12 children had dyslexia and 22 had typical reading skills for 18 hours either spread over three days or six weeks these children practice musical exercises like tapping out rhythms learning about pitch and duration and playing simple melodies before and after their training researchers tested their ability to tell apart similar sounds such as ba and pas as well as pick out examples of incorrect stress in three syllable words the results showed that following CMT training the kids with dyslexia got significantly better at distinguishing sounds from one another as well as picking up on incorrect prosody on top of that a further study by those same authors found that following the six-week training dyslexic kids reading skills improved even without any specific reading training the idea of using this connection between music and language is really exciting but the science isn't settled yet so while studies like this one found strong effects on reading others just haven't so for the moment psychologists need to better understand what exactly might be influencing improvements in reading and whether or not other experiments can get the same results dyslexia is just one of the many variations and how our brains and the world around us but thanks to its complexity it has a lot to show us about how we process things like language and rhythm and use them to make sense of our world thanks for watching this episode of scishow psyche and a special thank you to our patrons for supporting the work we do it takes a lot of people to make a scishow video and we

**Transcript**:
[Music] you might know of dyslexia as a reading disorder or that one condition that makes letters seem to float around on the page and that's understandable because it does mess with people's ability to read but it's more complex than letters flipping around and floating away years of research suggests that people with dyslexia might struggle with processing letters because they also have trouble processing of all things rhythm people with dyslexia tend to read more slowly than others misspelled words or confuse letters that look similar and the disorder is far from being uncommon most estimates say it affects at least 1 in 10 people but despite its impacts on reading dyslexia may actually be caused at least in part by something more Musical whether you realize it or not language has a whole lot of rhythm whole lotta rhythm a whole lotta rhythm a whole lot of rhythm a whole lotta rhythm just like that and I'm not talking about like beat boxing or slam poetry or whatever I just did I'm talking about everyday speech think about it like this if you say a word like difficult there's a right way to stress and pitch those sounds difficult is right and difficult just it sounds kind of weird this rhythm that's built into language is known as prosody most people have no trouble processing it they do it without even thinking but a study published in 2011 showed that people with dyslexia tend to have a harder time with this they're much less able to tell if a miss stressed word is pronounced right or wrong and if you have trouble parsing the rhythmic stress patterns and words that can make it extra tricky to match letters to the sounds of words in other words if you don't have a good internal representation of what the word is supposed to sound like when you read something there are fewer clues to help you link letters on the page to the meaning of the word scientists believe this might happen because of differences in the way dyslexic brains sample sound according to the theory of temporal sampling as sensory information like speech enters your brain your brain takes snapshots of that information so it doesn't just absorb information continuously it takes a bunch of snapshots at different rates some quicker than others and it uses those snapshots to put together an image or in this case an auditory representation of the signals it's receiving if we stick with the camera metaphor for a sec you can imagine the brain as a camera trying to take a picture of a hummingbird a non dyslexic brain is like a camera with a fast shutter speed it captures a clear moment in time even though the hummingbirds wings are beating really quickly on the other hand a dyslexic brain is more like a camera with a slower shutter speed so instead of capturing the wings clearly it captures a blur in the real world what that means is that sometimes a dyslexic brain doesn't process rhythmic information as fast as it's arriving as a result someone with dyslexia may not lock into rhythms and language as well as someone without dyslexia the difference or at least one of them seems to be in a part of the brain called the arcuate fasciculus which is a kind of connective highway between parts of the brain involved in language and those with dyslexia the arcuate fasciculus is smaller with less white matter to carry information and the fewer connections the harder it becomes to pass information around those language areas along with its role in language the arcuate fasciculus is also really important for music in fact there's some evidence that people with dyslexia could make use of this connection between language and music to improve their reading skills a 2016 study used what's called cognitive musical training or CMT on two groups of children between 8 and 12 years old 12 children had dyslexia and 22 had typical reading skills for 18 hours either spread over three days or six weeks these children practice musical exercises like tapping out rhythms learning about pitch and duration and playing simple melodies before and after their training researchers tested their ability to tell apart similar sounds such as ba and pas as well as pick out examples of incorrect stress in three syllable words the results showed that following CMT training the kids with dyslexia got significantly better at distinguishing sounds from one another as well as picking up on incorrect prosody on top of that a further study by those same authors found that following the six-week training dyslexic kids reading skills improved even without any specific reading training the idea of using this connection between music and language is really exciting but the science isn't settled yet so while studies like this one found strong effects on reading others just haven't so for the moment psychologists need to better understand what exactly might be influencing improvements in reading and whether or not other experiments can get the same results dyslexia is just one of the many variations and how our brains and the world around us but thanks to its complexity it has a lot to show us about how we process things like language and rhythm and use them to make sense of our world thanks for watching this episode of scishow psyche and a special thank you to our patrons for supporting the work we do it takes a lot of people to make a scishow video and we

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 1: What are the correct first three months of the year in order? Options: A. February, January, March, B. March, January, February, C. January, February, March, D. January, March, February Correct Option: C**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks to fill in the blank with the correct month between May and July, while Question 1 asks about the correct order of the first three months of the year. Both questions assess the learner's understanding of the sequence of months.

However, if I had to choose a question that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely in terms of the specific months mentioned (May, June, July), I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 7 is the closest in terms of the pattern of repetition and the sequence of months, although it does not specifically mention the months of May, June, and July.

But since I have to provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, I would say:

**Index: 1**

Please note that this is not an exact match, but rather the closest approximation based on the provided generated MCQs.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the last month of the year, which is a specific piece of information mentioned in the transcript. Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is the closest match in terms of content, as it also asks about specific months of the year. However, it asks about the first three months, not the last month.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ closely. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, although it's still quite different.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Imagine we want to build a new space port at one of four recently settled 
Martian bases, and are holding a vote 
to determine its location. Of the hundred colonists on Mars, 
42 live on West Base, 26 on North Base, 15 on South Base, and 17 on East Base. For our purposes, let’s assume 
that everyone prefers the space port to be as close to their base as possible, 
and will vote accordingly. What is the fairest way 
to conduct that vote? The most straightforward solution 
would be to just let each individual cast a single ballot, and choose 
the location with the most votes. This is known as plurality voting, 
or "first past the post." In this case, West Base wins easily, since it has more residents 
than any other. And yet, most colonists would consider 
this the worst result, given how far it is from everyone else. So is plurality vote 
really the fairest method? What if we tried a system 
like instant runoff voting, which accounts for the full range 
of people’s preferences rather than just their top choices? Here’s how it would work. First, voters rank 
each of the options from 1 to 4, and we compare their top picks. South receives the fewest votes 
for first place, so it’s eliminated. Its 15 votes get allocated 
to those voters’ second choice— East Base— giving it a total of 32. We then compare top preferences 
and cut the last place option again. This time North Base is eliminated. Its residents’ second choice 
would’ve been South Base, but since that’s already gone,
the votes go to their third choice. That gives East 58 votes over West’s 42, 
making it the winner. But this doesn’t seem fair either. Not only did East start out 
in second-to-last place, but a majority ranked it among 
their two least preferred options. Instead of using rankings, we could try 
voting in multiple rounds, with the top two winners 
proceeding to a separate runoff. Normally, this would mean West and North 
winning the first round, and North winning the second. But the residents of East Base realize that while they don’t have 
the votes to win, they can still skew the results 
in their favor. In the first round, they vote 
for South Base instead of their own, successfully keeping North 
from advancing. Thanks to this "tactical voting"
by East Base residents, South wins the second round easily,
despite being the least populated. Can a system be called fair and good 
if it incentivizes lying about your preferences? Maybe what we need to do 
is let voters express a preference in every possible head-to-head matchup. This is known as the Condorcet method. Consider one matchup: 
West versus North. All 100 colonists vote on their preference
between the two. So that's West's 42 versus 
the 58 from North, South, and East, who would all prefer North. Now do the same 
for the other five matchups. The victor will be whichever base 
wins the most times. Here, North wins three 
and South wins two. These are indeed the two 
most central locations, and North has the advantage of not being 
anyone’s least preferred choice. So does that make the Condorcet method 
an ideal voting system in general? Not necessarily. Consider an election 
with three candidates. If voters prefer A over B, and B over C, 
but prefer C over A, this method fails to select a winner. Over the decades, researchers 
and statisticians have come up with dozens of intricate ways 
of conducting and counting votes, and some have even been 
put into practice. But whichever one you choose, it's possible to imagine it delivering 
an unfair result. It turns out that our intuitive concept 
of fairness actually contains a number of assumptions 
that may contradict each other. It doesn’t seem fair for some voters 
to have more influence than others. But nor does it seem fair to simply 
ignore minority preferences, or encourage people to game the system. In fact, mathematical proofs 
have shown that for any election with more than two options, it’s impossible to design a voting system 
that doesn’t violate at least some theoretically
desirable criteria. So while we often think of democracy 
as a simple matter of counting votes, it’s also worth considering who benefits
from the different ways of counting them.

the location with the most votes. This is known as plurality voting, 
or "first past the post." In this case, West Base wins easily, since it has more residents 
than any other. And yet, most colonists would consider 
this the worst result, given how far it is from everyone else. So is plurality vote 
really the fairest method? What if we tried a system 
like instant runoff voting, which accounts for the full range 
of people’s preferences rather than just their top choices? Here’s how it would work. First, voters rank 
each of the options from 1 to 4, and we compare their top picks. South receives the fewest votes 
for first place, so it’s eliminated. Its 15 votes get allocated 
to those voters’ second choice— East Base— giving it a total of 32. We then compare top preferences 
and cut the last place option again. This time North Base is eliminated. Its residents’ second choice 
would’ve been South Base, but since that’s already gone,
the votes go to their third choice. That gives East 58 votes over West’s 42, 
making it the winner. But this doesn’t seem fair either. Not only did East start out 
in second-to-last place, but a majority ranked it among 
their two least preferred options. Instead of using rankings, we could try 
voting in multiple rounds, with the top two winners 
proceeding to a separate runoff. Normally, this would mean West and North 
winning the first round, and North winning the second. But the residents of East Base realize that while they don’t have 
the votes to win, they can still skew the results 
in their favor. In the first round, they vote 
for South Base instead of their own, successfully keeping North 
from advancing. Thanks to this "tactical voting"
by East Base residents, South wins the second round easily,
despite being the least populated. Can a system be called fair and good 
if it incentivizes lying about your preferences? Maybe what we need to do 
is let voters express a preference in every possible head-to-head matchup. This is known as the Condorcet method. Consider one matchup: 
West versus North. All 100 colonists vote on their preference
between the two. So that's West's 42 versus 
the 58 from North, South, and East, who would all prefer North. Now do the same 
for the other five matchups. The victor will be whichever base 
wins the most times. Here, North wins three 
and South wins two. These are indeed the two 
most central locations, and North has the advantage of not being 
anyone’s least preferred choice. So does that make the Condorcet method 
an ideal voting system in general? Not necessarily. Consider an election 
with three candidates. If voters prefer A over B, and B over C, 
but prefer C over A, this method fails to select a winner. Over the decades, researchers 
and statisticians have come up with dozens of intricate ways 
of conducting and counting votes, and some have even been 
put into practice. But whichever one you choose, it's possible to imagine it delivering 
an unfair result. It turns out that our intuitive concept 
of fairness actually contains a number of assumptions 
that may contradict each other. It doesn’t seem fair for some voters 
to have more influence than others. But nor does it seem fair to simply 
ignore minority preferences, or encourage people to game the system. In fact, mathematical proofs 
have shown that for any election with more than two options, it’s impossible to design a voting system 
that doesn’t violate at least some theoretically
desirable criteria. So while we often think of democracy 
as a simple matter of counting votes, it’s also worth considering who benefits
from the different ways of counting them.

**Transcript**:
Imagine we want to build a new space port at one of four recently settled 
Martian bases, and are holding a vote 
to determine its location. Of the hundred colonists on Mars, 
42 live on West Base, 26 on North Base, 15 on South Base, and 17 on East Base. For our purposes, let’s assume 
that everyone prefers the space port to be as close to their base as possible,

**Transcript**:
It’s summer! It’s time for Squeaks and I to get out our
swimsuits, our /cool/ shades, and head outside for some fun in the sun! But I need to make some smart choices before
we go outside. I need to wear sunscreen, because I don’t
want to end up getting a sunburn! Squeaks doesn’t need to worry about sunburns,
since he’s a robot. But we humans can get a sunburn when we stay
out in the sun too long and don’t protect our skin. Even though the rays of the sun feel nice
and warm, and are important for all kinds of life on the Earth, some of the rays from
the sun’s light can harm our skin. Now, our skin /does/ have something in it
that helps to protect it from these harmful rays. But sometimes, like when you’re outside
all day, that’s not enough. If too many of these rays reach your skin,
your skin can become damaged, or hurt. When skin gets damaged, the body does its
best to fix it as soon as possible. It sends more blood to the damaged area, which
causes the skin there to get pink or red, and feel warm when you touch it. The damaged area can feel /really/ sore, and
some of the skin can also peel off. These are all signs of sunburn. There are lots of things that can affect whether
you get a sunburn or not. People with lighter skin sunburn more easily,
and spending more time outside can also lead to more of a sunburn. But anyone can get a sunburn. Luckily, there are plenty of different things
we can do to keep from getting one. For example, wearing clothes that cover our
skin and completely block the sun’s light can keep those harmful rays from getting to
the skin on our bodies. And wearing a hat can keep those rays from
causing a sunburn on our heads. We can also try to spend less time in the
sun when its rays are brightest—that’s usually between ten in the morning and four
in the afternoon. But one of the easiest things we can do is
to wear sunscreen. Sunscreen can be a lotion, a cream, or a spray. But no matter what kind of sunscreen you use,
it keeps some of the sun’s rays from getting to your skin, and can help stop a sunburn. Most sunscreens work by either soaking up
those harmful rays, kind of like a sponge, or by reflecting them, kind of like a mirror. Most experts say that you should put sunscreen
at least ten minutes before you go outside. And you should put on lots of it! It’s a good idea to get some help putting
on sunscreen, especially in places that are kind of hard to reach, like all over your
back. You might also want to get help putting it
on other places — especially places you might not think about, like your ears, the
backs of your legs, and the back of your neck! And once you get your sunscreen on, you should
make sure you keep it on! It’s a great idea to take a break every
few hours and to put on some more sunscreen, especially if you’re running around and
getting sweaty, or you’re swimming at the pool or the beach. So, enjoy your time in sun this summer … but
don’t forget to wear your sunscreen! Thanks for joining us for this episode of

It’s summer! It’s time for Squeaks and I to get out our
swimsuits, our /cool/ shades, and head outside for some fun in the sun! But I need to make some smart choices before
we go outside. I need to wear sunscreen, because I don’t
want to end up getting a sunburn! Squeaks doesn’t need to worry about sunburns,
since he’s a robot. But we humans can get a sunburn when we stay
out in the sun too long and don’t protect our skin. Even though the rays of the sun feel nice
and warm, and are important for all kinds of life on the Earth, some of the rays from
the sun’s light can harm our skin. Now, our skin /does/ have something in it
that helps to protect it from these harmful rays. But sometimes, like when you’re outside
all day, that’s not enough. If too many of these rays reach your skin,
your skin can become damaged, or hurt. When skin gets damaged, the body does its
best to fix it as soon as possible. It sends more blood to the damaged area, which
causes the skin there to get pink or red, and feel warm when you touch it. The damaged area can feel /really/ sore, and
some of the skin can also peel off. These are all signs of sunburn. There are lots of things that can affect whether
you get a sunburn or not. People with lighter skin sunburn more easily,
and spending more time outside can also lead to more of a sunburn. But anyone can get a sunburn. Luckily, there are plenty of different things
we can do to keep from getting one. For example, wearing clothes that cover our
skin and completely block the sun’s light can keep those harmful rays from getting to
the skin on our bodies. And wearing a hat can keep those rays from
causing a sunburn on our heads. We can also try to spend less time in the
sun when its rays are brightest—that’s usually between ten in the morning and four
in the afternoon. But one of the easiest things we can do is
to wear sunscreen. Sunscreen can be a lotion, a cream, or a spray. But no matter what kind of sunscreen you use,
it keeps some of the sun’s rays from getting to your skin, and can help stop a sunburn. Most sunscreens work by either soaking up
those harmful rays, kind of like a sponge, or by reflecting them, kind of like a mirror. Most experts say that you should put sunscreen
at least ten minutes before you go outside. And you should put on lots of it! It’s a good idea to get some help putting
on sunscreen, especially in places that are kind of hard to reach, like all over your
back. You might also want to get help putting it
on other places — especially places you might not think about, like your ears, the
backs of your legs, and the back of your neck! And once you get your sunscreen on, you should
make sure you keep it on! It’s a great idea to take a break every
few hours and to put on some more sunscreen, especially if you’re running around and
getting sweaty, or you’re swimming at the pool or the beach. So, enjoy your time in sun this summer … but
don’t forget to wear your sunscreen! Thanks for joining us for this episode of

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: What is the relationship between skin type and sunburn risk?**

Although this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about factors that affect sunburn risk, and Question 7 addresses one of those factors, which is skin type.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about which factor is NOT related to sunburn risk, whereas the generated MCQs primarily focus on factors that are related to sunburn risk.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match, but I would like to note that the generated MCQs do not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

One of my favorite things to do on this channel
is to get you to look at the world you know in a different way, to take something you
thought was ordinary, and show you why it’s amazing. Today I’m here in Alaska, and you’re never
gonna look at beavers the same way again. They chew down trees, and they build dams. But what most people don’t know is without
beavers, North America–and much of the world–would be totally different than it is today. Beavers are one of the ultimate keystone species—a
plant or animal so important to an ecosystem, that without it, the whole thing would basically
break. Their dams create habitats for dozens of species,
filter and purify water, and enrich the soil by trapping sediment and nutrients. Beaver ponds reshape landscapes on such an
enormous scale it impacts all other wildlife and vegetation in the area. Earth is home to two beaver species today:
one in Europe, and these here in North America. They’re the second largest rodents living
today, and like most rodents they have big front teeth that never stop growing. Beaver teeth are actually reinforced with
iron, and with their enormous jaw muscles they use those teeth to slice through bark
and chop down trees. Besides being carpenters, they even play the
part of plumbers. When a beaver hears the sound of running water,
it drives them nuts, they know the dam has sprung a leak and they have an uncontrollable
instinct to go patch it up. Beavers are ecosystem engineers second only
to humans, and they stay pretty DAM busy keeping this pond nice and full. Beavers’ urge to build can sometimes cause
headaches, but NO beavers can be an even BIGGER problem. Before European colonists arrived, there were
as many as 400 million beavers in the US and Canada! North America was covered with tens of millions
of beaver dams. Imagine between 5 and 30 beavers on every
kilometer of stream or river on the whole continent! That’s a lotta beavers. But over a few hundred years they were almost
hunted to extinction. Beavers were big business. They were trapped for fur, mostly to make
hats, but also for sacs on their butts full of castoreum—a pungent substance used in
perfumes. The British Hudson’s Bay Company even tried
to eradicate beavers from the Pacific Northwestv, figuring with no beavers left to hunt, the
United States would stop its westward expansion. Wherever pioneers went, they killed every
beaver they could find, despite the fact that beavers were responsible for most of the farmland
in the West. Populations dwindled from millions to the
low thousands. Without beaver dams, huge areas of land are
left with less water. hundreds of species (like fish, birds, insects,
and amphibians) are left without a habitat. So… beaver dams are great for other species,
but what’s in it for the beavers? Why do they build them? For beavers the pond created by their dams
is a safe place to build a home, called a lodge, where they raise their young and keep
away from predators. Beavers are pretty awkward on land, but they
are safe and happy in the water. The entrance to a beaver lodge is underwater,
so beavers can safely scoot in and out. Since they don’t hibernate, this lets them
access underwater food stores even when their ponds are frozen over. Beavers’ favorite foods are the leaves and
soft outer bark of trees, but like most mammals, they don’t digest wood very well, so they
eat their excrement to get the most out of a meal… until it eventually comes out looking
like sawdust. A crew of beavers spotted in a pond is usually
a family. Beaver couples often mate for life and beaver
kits live with their parents for a couple years while they practice their engineering
skills. The oldest dams ever discovered are 100,000
years old telling us beavers or their close relatives have been altering our landscapes
even before we moved in. And for most of the thousands of years we’ve
lived together, we’ve lived in harmony. Now that we’ve realized how important they
are, beaver populations are starting to recover. More beavers means more homes for
fish and birds, fresher water, and less damage from flooding and forest fires. Beavers feature prominently in the oral histories
of North America’s First Nations people, even playing a part in many creation myths,
which is neat, because beavers really have created much of the landscape we live in,
showing us how old and important our relationship is with the smartest thing in fur pants. Stay curious! Beavers are big as rodents go today, but during
the Pleistocene, Earth was home to a beaver called Castoroides the size of a black bear. Too bad they went extinct.

One of my favorite things to do on this channel
is to get you to look at the world you know in a different way, to take something you
thought was ordinary, and show you why it’s amazing. Today I’m here in Alaska, and you’re never
gonna look at beavers the same way again. They chew down trees, and they build dams. But what most people don’t know is without
beavers, North America–and much of the world–would be totally different than it is today. Beavers are one of the ultimate keystone species—a
plant or animal so important to an ecosystem, that without it, the whole thing would basically
break. Their dams create habitats for dozens of species,
filter and purify water, and enrich the soil by trapping sediment and nutrients. Beaver ponds reshape landscapes on such an
enormous scale it impacts all other wildlife and vegetation in the area. Earth is home to two beaver species today:
one in Europe, and these here in North America. They’re the second largest rodents living
today, and like most rodents they have big front teeth that never stop growing. Beaver teeth are actually reinforced with
iron, and with their enormous jaw muscles they use those teeth to slice through bark
and chop down trees. Besides being carpenters, they even play the
part of plumbers. When a beaver hears the sound of running water,
it drives them nuts, they know the dam has sprung a leak and they have an uncontrollable
instinct to go patch it up. Beavers are ecosystem engineers second only
to humans, and they stay pretty DAM busy keeping this pond nice and full. Beavers’ urge to build can sometimes cause
headaches, but NO beavers can be an even BIGGER problem. Before European colonists arrived, there were
as many as 400 million beavers in the US and Canada! North America was covered with tens of millions
of beaver dams. Imagine between 5 and 30 beavers on every
kilometer of stream or river on the whole continent! That’s a lotta beavers. But over a few hundred years they were almost
hunted to extinction. Beavers were big business. They were trapped for fur, mostly to make
hats, but also for sacs on their butts full of castoreum—a pungent substance used in
perfumes. The British Hudson’s Bay Company even tried
to eradicate beavers from the Pacific Northwestv, figuring with no beavers left to hunt, the
United States would stop its westward expansion. Wherever pioneers went, they killed every
beaver they could find, despite the fact that beavers were responsible for most of the farmland
in the West. Populations dwindled from millions to the
low thousands. Without beaver dams, huge areas of land are
left with less water. hundreds of species (like fish, birds, insects,
and amphibians) are left without a habitat. So… beaver dams are great for other species,
but what’s in it for the beavers? Why do they build them? For beavers the pond created by their dams
is a safe place to build a home, called a lodge, where they raise their young and keep
away from predators. Beavers are pretty awkward on land, but they
are safe and happy in the water. The entrance to a beaver lodge is underwater,
so beavers can safely scoot in and out. Since they don’t hibernate, this lets them
access underwater food stores even when their ponds are frozen over. Beavers’ favorite foods are the leaves and
soft outer bark of trees, but like most mammals, they don’t digest wood very well, so they
eat their excrement to get the most out of a meal… until it eventually comes out looking
like sawdust. A crew of beavers spotted in a pond is usually
a family. Beaver couples often mate for life and beaver
kits live with their parents for a couple years while they practice their engineering
skills. The oldest dams ever discovered are 100,000
years old telling us beavers or their close relatives have been altering our landscapes
even before we moved in. And for most of the thousands of years we’ve
lived together, we’ve lived in harmony. Now that we’ve realized how important they
are, beaver populations are starting to recover. More beavers means more homes for
fish and birds, fresher water, and less damage from flooding and forest fires. Beavers feature prominently in the oral histories
of North America’s First Nations people, even playing a part in many creation myths,
which is neat, because beavers really have created much of the landscape we live in,
showing us how old and important our relationship is with the smartest thing in fur pants. Stay curious! Beavers are big as rodents go today, but during
the Pleistocene, Earth was home to a beaver called Castoroides the size of a black bear. Too bad they went extinct.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of beavers and their characteristics.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the largest rodent on Earth, given that beavers are the second largest. The generated MCQs do not contain a question that directly asks about the largest rodent. However, Question 1 mentions that beavers are big as rodents go today and also mentions that during the Pleistocene, Earth was home to a beaver called Castoroides the size of a black bear.

Although not a direct match, the most similar generated MCQ in terms of topic relevance is:

 Question 1: What is unique about a beaver's front teeth? 

However, this is not a close match.

If I had to choose a question that has some relation to the topic of beavers and their size, I would choose:

 Question 1, but keep in mind that the relation is very weak.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that directly address the topic of the largest rodent on Earth, given that beavers are the second largest.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4: What is a significant impact of the decline of beaver populations on the environment? is related to the effect of European colonists on beaver populations.

However, a more relevant question is Question 2: Approximately how many beavers were in the US and Canada before European colonists arrived? This question provides context for the decline of beaver populations after European colonists arrived.

But the most similar question in terms of intent is not present among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest in terms of discussing the impact of an event (decline of beaver populations) on the environment, which is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

to humans, and they stay pretty DAM busy keeping this pond nice and full. Beavers’ urge to build can sometimes cause
headaches, but NO beavers can be an even BIGGER problem. Before European colonists arrived, there were
as many as 400 million beavers in the US and Canada! North America was covered with tens of millions
of beaver dams. Imagine between 5 and 30 beavers on every
kilometer of stream or river on the whole continent! That’s a lotta beavers. But over a few hundred years they were almost
hunted to extinction. Beavers were big business. They were trapped for fur, mostly to make
hats, but also for sacs on their butts full of castoreum—a pungent substance used in
perfumes. The British Hudson’s Bay Company even tried
to eradicate beavers from the Pacific Northwestv, figuring with no beavers left to hunt, the
United States would stop its westward expansion. Wherever pioneers went, they killed every
beaver they could find, despite the fact that beavers were responsible for most of the farmland
in the West. Populations dwindled from millions to the
low thousands. Without beaver dams, huge areas of land are
left with less water. hundreds of species (like fish, birds, insects,
and amphibians) are left without a habitat. So… beaver dams are great for other species,
but what’s in it for the beavers? Why do they build them? For beavers the pond created by their dams
is a safe place to build a home, called a lodge, where they raise their young and keep
away from predators. Beavers are pretty awkward on land, but they
are safe and happy in the water. The entrance to a beaver lodge is underwater,
so beavers can safely scoot in and out. Since they don’t hibernate, this lets them
access underwater food stores even when their ponds are frozen over. Beavers’ favorite foods are the leaves and
soft outer bark of trees, but like most mammals, they don’t digest wood very well, so they
eat their excrement to get the most out of a meal… until it eventually comes out looking
like sawdust. A crew of beavers spotted in a pond is usually
a family. Beaver couples often mate for life and beaver
kits live with their parents for a couple years while they practice their engineering
skills. The oldest dams ever discovered are 100,000
years old telling us beavers or their close relatives have been altering our landscapes
even before we moved in. And for most of the thousands of years we’ve
lived together, we’ve lived in harmony. Now that we’ve realized how important they
are, beaver populations are starting to recover. More beavers means more homes for
fish and birds, fresher water, and less damage from flooding and forest fires. Beavers feature prominently in the oral histories
of North America’s First Nations people, even playing a part in many creation myths,
which is neat, because beavers really have created much of the landscape we live in,
showing us how old and important our relationship is with the smartest thing in fur pants. Stay curious! Beavers are big as rodents go today, but during
the Pleistocene, Earth was home to a beaver called Castoroides the size of a black bear. Too bad they went extinct.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In 1879, when James Hingsley returned to Australia
from Indonesia he brought back tales of an orchid that engulfed butterflies in its petals
and devoured them alive. A carnivorous plant more beautiful and ravenous
than any other. But that fantastical creature was no plant
– it was a predator... dressed to kill. [OPEN] Blending in is a great way to stay alive,
but it can be just as useful for the hunter as the hunted. That butterfly-eating beast from Indonesia? That isn’t an orchid at all. It’s an orchid mantis, an insect native
to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. These beautiful bugs exhibit a behavior called
aggressive mimicry: that’s using a disguise not to hide, but to stand out. It’s counterintuitive, but you’ve probably
come across one such creature before. Nope, not waldo. Like a snapping turtle’s wriggly worm-tongue,
or an Angler fish’s luminous bait, some animals use the promise of food to conceal
more deadly intentions. Some parasites even mimic their hosts’ prey
to get swallowed. Other mimics rely on smellovision to do the
trick. One spider attracts prey by sending out a
chemical signal that female moths usually use to attract mates. Like the plants they’re named after, these
mantises use their looks to flirt. Orchids display beautiful patterns to attract
their favorite pollinators: bees and flies. And with their petaled legs wrapped in pinks
and yellows, orchid mantises can disappear amongst those forests of flowers. They wear such a good disguise, that every
so often an insect *looking* for dinner *becomes* dinner. At least, that’s what scientists thought…
until one noticed something weird: orchid mantises don’t actually need any flowers
around for their disguises to work. They attract prey even *better* than the real
thing. To understand why, we have to think – and
see – like a flying insect. That means looking beyond our human senses. It would be hard for you or I to pluck an
orchid mantis from a flowery background. Our visual system picks up on the shapes,
edges and finer details of the mantis’s disguise. Our brains see petals, and think “flower”. On the other hand, bees, flies – even beetles
and butterflies see the floral fatales completely differently. Pollinator eyes and brains don’t pick up
on the fine details, but the bigger picture comes in loud and clear. To these prey animals, an orchid mantis doesn’t
just look like a flower, it looks bigger and brighter than a flower – and there lies
the trick. Some flowering plants “get it on” with
anything willing to stop by, but orchids are exclusive with their pollinators. One type only attracts male bees from a single
species. If an orchid mantis’ disguise was too particular,
it would limit the number of animals it might fool. Instead, by looking a little like every flower,
they can attract even more prey. These animal liars *fool* our brains too,
but orchid mantises didn’t *evolve* to fool human brains. In fact, the way they deceive us falls into
a totally different camouflage category: cryptic mimicry. Like their close kin, orchid mantises will
even rock back and forth like a flower swaying in the breeze. We don’t know for sure, but scientists think
looking like an orchid could also help conceal them from predators like birds, lizards, and
monkeys in the same way. Pinning down how these predators and parasites
evolved their deadly strategies of disguise has been almost impossible until recently. And we’re still figuring them out. Some disguises are so good, their true purpose
can be hard to see. Stay curious.

monkeys in the same way. Pinning down how these predators and parasites
evolved their deadly strategies of disguise has been almost impossible until recently. And we’re still figuring them out. Some disguises are so good, their true purpose
can be hard to see. Stay curious.

[ INTRO ] I’m so glad you’re still having fun with
that balloon, Squeaks! [Squeaks thanks her for saving it] Oh right! We did almost lose it earlier today. We were in the pizza store getting some lunch, and the balloon slipped out of Squeaks’
paw! It went up to the ceiling, but the string
was hanging down far enough that I could grab it back. Then we tied it to a water bottle from my
backpack so it wouldn’t get away again. It’s a good thing it didn’t escape while
we were outside! [Squeaks asks what would have happened] Well, a couple of different things can happen
to a balloon that escapes into the sky — the regular type of balloon, I mean, that’s
made out of the stretchy rubber stuff. First, the balloon starts to rise higher and
higher into the air. That’s because balloons aren’t filled
with regular air, like the kind we breathe. They’re filled with something called helium,
and it makes the balloon lighter for its size than the air around it. So it starts to float on the air, just like
certain things float on water. If you try to push a plastic spoon to the
bottom of a bowl of water, the spoon will just float to the top again. If someone lets go of a helium balloon outside,
it starts to rise through the air like the spoon at the bottom of the bowl rises through
the water. But unlike the small amount of water in the
bowl, there’s lots of air all around us, and it stretches up really high in the sky. So the balloon keeps floating higher and higher
and higher. And as it goes higher, the air around it starts
to change. The higher into the sky you go, the less air
there is. There’s still some air, but it becomes more
spread out. And as the air outside the balloon spreads
out, the helium inside the balloon starts to spread out, too, pushing out on the inside
of the balloon. What happens next depends on the strength
of the stuff the balloon is made of. If the balloon isn’t very strong, the helium
pushing on it will pop the balloon before it gets too high up. Then the pieces just fall back down to the
ground. That’s why it’s usually not a good idea
to send balloons into the sky on purpose. When they come back down in those big pieces, they can hurt animals that think they’re
food and try to swallow them. But if the balloon is stronger, something
different will happen. It will keep floating higher and higher up
into the air — sometimes even as high as an airplane! But the air very high up in the sky isn’t
just more spread out — it’s also much colder. When you’re as high up as airplanes go,
it’s freeeeezing. And when rubber gets cold, it becomes stiffer
and less stretchy. So eventually, with the cold combined with
the helium pushing on it from the inside, the balloon can actually /shatter/, breaking
into super tiny little pieces. Those also fall back down to the ground, but
since they’re so small you probably wouldn’t be able to see them. Whether it pops or shatters, the balloon always
does two things: it goes up very high, as far as it can go! And then it comes back down. That’s actually what happened to your balloon
too, Squeaks! Except, since we were inside, it could only go as
high as the ceiling, and then we were able to pull it back down. Have you ever lost a balloon? What do you think happened to it? Ask a grownup to help you leave a comment

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: What is the cause-and-effect relationship between the helium inside a balloon and the surrounding air?**

Options: A. The helium inside the balloon is pushed by the surrounding air, causing it to float., B. The helium inside the balloon pushes on the surrounding air, causing it to float., C. The helium inside the balloon has no effect on the surrounding air., D. The surrounding air pushes on the helium inside the balloon, causing it to sink.

Correct Option: B

Although the question phrasing is different, the content and intent of Question 8 are closest to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions deal with the relationship between the helium inside the balloon and the surrounding air as the balloon floats up. The correct option in Question 8 (B) also aligns with the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (D), which states that the air outside the balloon and the helium inside the balloon start to spread out.

However, it's worth noting that there isn't a perfect match among the generated MCQs, as none of them exactly replicate the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, Question 8 is the most similar in terms of content and intent.

♪ You’re right, Squeaks; this one is a classic. But did you know that the best part of cartoons
takes place inside your brain? Cartoons like these are made of a bunch of
drawings. When you show those drawings one after another,
super fast, they look like they’re really moving! That’s called an animation. But they’re not really alive, or moving
around — it’s an illusion, a little trick that you can play on your brain. And today Squeaks and I are going to make
our very own version of this trick, called a zoetrope. If we spin all these drawings together really
fast, they just look like a blur. That’s why our zoetrope is going to have
slits, which are little holes. We’ll see each drawing through the slit,
and then see a black space after each one. It will be like we’re seeing each drawing
on its own, but super duper fast. And then when we spin the zoetrope, our brains
will stop noticing the black space and connect the drawings together. The faster the zoetrope spins, the smoother
the animation will be! You can make your own zoetrope along with
us! All you need is: some black construction paper, some white
construction paper, scissors, tape, a ruler, two pencils, a round piece of cardboard or a paper plate,
about 25 centimeters, or 10 inches across, and a grownup to help, because we’ll be
doing some measuring and cutting. For our base, we cut out this round piece
of cardboard, although you can also use a paper plate. We’ll make a small hole in the middle, just
big enough to push one of the pencils through and have the eraser catch on the top. But we won’t put the pencil in yet. Next, we need to make the walls of the zoetrope. For that, we’ll use the black and white
paper. First, we’ll cut two pieces of the black
paper in half, the long way, so we have four long strips. Then we’ll take three of the strips and
tape them together. Next, we’ll wrap them around the outside
of the cardboard bas. We might need to trim a little off the end
to make sure it fits exactly. This is where we’ll put the slits, to look
through and see the animation! We’ll cut 13 slits, each about 3 millimeters,
or an eighth of an inch wide, into the top half of the black strip. We’ll try to make them evenly spaced, about
4 centimeters, or one and a half inches, apart. Just like we did with the black paper, we’ll
cut a piece of white paper in half so we have two long strips. We’re going to take those two, and cut them
in half. That gives us four long strips of paper. We’re going to take three of them, and tape
them all together. Our white strip is now half as tall as our
black strip… and we’re going to cut it so it’s the same length. The white strip of paper will become the rectangles
we use for each drawing. To make those rectangles, we’ll use the
ruler and one of the pencils to measure the strips into 13 rectangles that are each about
4 centimeters, or one and a half inches, across. Now it’s time to draw! Our animation is going to be cyclical, which
means that as soon as it’s done, it’s going to start over again from the beginning. So it’s good to have an animation that ends
right back where it started – like a plane taking off and coming back down, or a person
taking off her hat and putting it back on. We’re going to draw our friend Dino flapping
his wings! Each of your frames should look a lot like
the last one, with tiny changes from one to the next. See how his wings move up and down just a
tiny bit each rectangle? That will help the animation look smoother! Once our drawings are done, we’ll tape them
to the bottom half of the black paper , with each rectangle right below one of the slits. Now we just need to tape the paper around
the base, with the drawings on the inside. Now all we need is to make it spin! So we just stick this pencil through the hole
we made in the base earlier, so the eraser catches on the frame and the pencil doesn’t
fall all the way through. Nice! You could also use chopsticks for this, or
glue the hole in your base to a marble, so that it can spin on a table. Or, with some help from a grown-up, you might
be able to use a record player or a spinning cake platform! And now … we spin. Oh cool! Check it out! If the drawings move fast enough, two illusions
happen to make them look like an animation. In between each frame, there’s a blank spot,
where there’s nothing to see. But when the drawings come quickly enough,
one after the next, your brain stops noticing the blank spaces in between. That’s the first illusion — the effect
of one frame on your eye lasts until the next one comes up. All your brain notices is the drawings. The second illusion is when your brain sees
all those separate drawings and thinks that the pictures are moving! It fills in the blanks in between the frames
for you, and turns them into something that makes sense, like Dino flying! So you can just see the animation – and
enjoy the cartoon. Squeaks, we make an awesome animation team! Did you make a zoetrope too? What would you want to make a cartoon about? We’d love to hear about it! Just ask a grown-up to help you go to patreon.com/scishowkids

our very own version of this trick, called a zoetrope. If we spin all these drawings together really

slits, which are little holes. We’ll see each drawing through the slit,
and then see a black space after each one. It will be like we’re seeing each drawing

will stop noticing the black space and connect the drawings together. The faster the zoetrope spins, the smoother
the animation will be! You can make your own zoetrope along with

paper. First, we’ll cut two pieces of the black
paper in half, the long way, so we have four long strips. Then we’ll take three of the strips and
tape them together. Next, we’ll wrap them around the outside
of the cardboard bas. We might need to trim a little off the end
to make sure it fits exactly. This is where we’ll put the slits, to look
through and see the animation! We’ll cut 13 slits, each about 3 millimeters,
or an eighth of an inch wide, into the top half of the black strip. We’ll try to make them evenly spaced, about
4 centimeters, or one and a half inches, apart. Just like we did with the black paper, we’ll
cut a piece of white paper in half so we have two long strips. We’re going to take those two, and cut them
in half. That gives us four long strips of paper. We’re going to take three of them, and tape
them all together. Our white strip is now half as tall as our
black strip… and we’re going to cut it so it’s the same length. The white strip of paper will become the rectangles
we use for each drawing. To make those rectangles, we’ll use the
ruler and one of the pencils to measure the strips into 13 rectangles that are each about
4 centimeters, or one and a half inches, across. Now it’s time to draw! Our animation is going to be cyclical, which
means that as soon as it’s done, it’s going to start over again from the beginning. So it’s good to have an animation that ends
right back where it started – like a plane taking off and coming back down, or a person
taking off her hat and putting it back on. We’re going to draw our friend Dino flapping
his wings! Each of your frames should look a lot like
the last one, with tiny changes from one to the next. See how his wings move up and down just a
tiny bit each rectangle? That will help the animation look smoother! Once our drawings are done, we’ll tape them
to the bottom half of the black paper , with each rectangle right below one of the slits. Now we just need to tape the paper around
the base, with the drawings on the inside. Now all we need is to make it spin! So we just stick this pencil through the hole
we made in the base earlier, so the eraser catches on the frame and the pencil doesn’t
fall all the way through. Nice! You could also use chopsticks for this, or
glue the hole in your base to a marble, so that it can spin on a table. Or, with some help from a grown-up, you might
be able to use a record player or a spinning cake platform! And now … we spin. Oh cool! Check it out! If the drawings move fast enough, two illusions
happen to make them look like an animation. In between each frame, there’s a blank spot,
where there’s nothing to see. But when the drawings come quickly enough,
one after the next, your brain stops noticing the blank spaces in between. That’s the first illusion — the effect
of one frame on your eye lasts until the next one comes up. All your brain notices is the drawings. The second illusion is when your brain sees
all those separate drawings and thinks that the pictures are moving! It fills in the blanks in between the frames
for you, and turns them into something that makes sense, like Dino flying! So you can just see the animation – and
enjoy the cartoon. Squeaks, we make an awesome animation team! Did you make a zoetrope too? What would you want to make a cartoon about? We’d love to hear about it! Just ask a grown-up to help you go to patreon.com/scishowkids

♪ You’re right, Squeaks; this one is a classic. But did you know that the best part of cartoons
takes place inside your brain? Cartoons like these are made of a bunch of
drawings. When you show those drawings one after another,
super fast, they look like they’re really moving! That’s called an animation. But they’re not really alive, or moving
around — it’s an illusion, a little trick that you can play on your brain. And today Squeaks and I are going to make
our very own version of this trick, called a zoetrope. If we spin all these drawings together really
fast, they just look like a blur. That’s why our zoetrope is going to have
slits, which are little holes. We’ll see each drawing through the slit,
and then see a black space after each one. It will be like we’re seeing each drawing
on its own, but super duper fast. And then when we spin the zoetrope, our brains
will stop noticing the black space and connect the drawings together. The faster the zoetrope spins, the smoother
the animation will be! You can make your own zoetrope along with
us! All you need is: some black construction paper, some white
construction paper, scissors, tape, a ruler, two pencils, a round piece of cardboard or a paper plate,
about 25 centimeters, or 10 inches across, and a grownup to help, because we’ll be
doing some measuring and cutting. For our base, we cut out this round piece
of cardboard, although you can also use a paper plate. We’ll make a small hole in the middle, just
big enough to push one of the pencils through and have the eraser catch on the top. But we won’t put the pencil in yet. Next, we need to make the walls of the zoetrope. For that, we’ll use the black and white
paper. First, we’ll cut two pieces of the black
paper in half, the long way, so we have four long strips. Then we’ll take three of the strips and
tape them together. Next, we’ll wrap them around the outside
of the cardboard bas. We might need to trim a little off the end
to make sure it fits exactly. This is where we’ll put the slits, to look
through and see the animation! We’ll cut 13 slits, each about 3 millimeters,
or an eighth of an inch wide, into the top half of the black strip. We’ll try to make them evenly spaced, about
4 centimeters, or one and a half inches, apart. Just like we did with the black paper, we’ll
cut a piece of white paper in half so we have two long strips. We’re going to take those two, and cut them
in half. That gives us four long strips of paper. We’re going to take three of them, and tape
them all together. Our white strip is now half as tall as our
black strip… and we’re going to cut it so it’s the same length. The white strip of paper will become the rectangles
we use for each drawing. To make those rectangles, we’ll use the
ruler and one of the pencils to measure the strips into 13 rectangles that are each about
4 centimeters, or one and a half inches, across. Now it’s time to draw! Our animation is going to be cyclical, which
means that as soon as it’s done, it’s going to start over again from the beginning. So it’s good to have an animation that ends
right back where it started – like a plane taking off and coming back down, or a person
taking off her hat and putting it back on. We’re going to draw our friend Dino flapping
his wings! Each of your frames should look a lot like
the last one, with tiny changes from one to the next. See how his wings move up and down just a
tiny bit each rectangle? That will help the animation look smoother! Once our drawings are done, we’ll tape them
to the bottom half of the black paper , with each rectangle right below one of the slits. Now we just need to tape the paper around
the base, with the drawings on the inside. Now all we need is to make it spin! So we just stick this pencil through the hole

glue the hole in your base to a marble, so that it can spin on a table. Or, with some help from a grown-up, you might
be able to use a record player or a spinning cake platform! And now … we spin. Oh cool! Check it out! If the drawings move fast enough, two illusions
happen to make them look like an animation. In between each frame, there’s a blank spot,
where there’s nothing to see. But when the drawings come quickly enough,
one after the next, your brain stops noticing the blank spaces in between. That’s the first illusion — the effect

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: How does the brain contribute to the illusion of movement created by a zoetrope?

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also deals with the illusion created by the zoetrope and how the brain processes the information. The correct option for Question 3, "By filling in the blanks between the frames and ignoring the black spaces," is similar to the correct option for the ground truth MCQ, "Your brain stops noticing the blanks spots between pictures when the zoetrope is moving fast." 

However, it's worth noting that Question 3 is not an exact match for the ground truth MCQ, as it does not provide the same options. A more similar question would be one that provides options A and C from the ground truth MCQ, which describe the two illusions created by the zoetrope.

Since there isn't a more similar question, I will provide the index of Question 3.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

However, an even more similar question is Question 5, but the options are presented as sentences rather than isolated words.

The closest match in terms of isolated words is Question 2, but it only asks about "they're", whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the correct usage of "there", "their", and "they're" in a sentence.

A more similar question is needed, one that presents the three words as isolated options. Since this is not available, the closest match is Question 8, but a more suitable match would be a question that combines elements of Questions 5 and 8.

If a new question were generated that is similar to Question 5 but presents isolated words as options, like this:

Question: Which homophone would you use in this sentence? This is ______ house.
Options: A. there, B. their, C. they're

Then this new question would be the most similar match.

However, given the current options, the closest match is Question 8, but it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, Question 5 is still not a perfect match, but it is a better match than Question 8 because it tests the correct usage of the three homophones in a sentence.

A new question is still needed to perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Considering the available options again, Question 5 is a better match than Question 8 because it assesses the correct usage of "there", "their", and "they're" in a sentence, even though the options are presented as sentences rather than isolated words.

Given the current options and the need for a closer match, it is essential to note that the best match is not ideal, but Question 5 is a better choice than Question 8.

However, an even better match can be found by re-evaluating the generated MCQs.

Upon re-evaluation, it is clear that a new question is needed to perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ again, Question 5 is still a better match than Question 8, but it is not perfect.

Given the options and the need for a closer match, it is clear that Question 5 is the best available choice, even though it is not ideal.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5.

**Transcript**:
At some point between 
the 1st and 5th century CE, the Hindu sage Patañjali began to codify
the ancient, meditative traditions practiced throughout India. He recorded techniques nearly as old 
as Indian civilization itself in 196 manuals called the Yoga Sutras. These texts defined yoga as the ‘yoking’ 
or restraining of the mind from focusing on external objects in efforts to reach a state 
of pure consciousness. Over time, yoga came to incorporate
physical elements from gymnastics and wrestling. Today, there are a multitude of approaches
to modern yoga— though most still maintain the three core
elements of Patañjali’s practice: physical postures, breathing exercises, 
and spiritual contemplation. This blend of physical 
and mental exercise is widely believed to have a unique set 
of health advantages. Such as improving strength
and flexibility, boosting heart and lung function, 
and enhancing psychological well-being. But what have contemporary studies shown
regarding the benefits of this ancient tradition? Despite attempts by many researchers, it's tough to make specific claims 
about yoga's advantages. Its unique combination of activities 
makes it difficult to determine which component is producing 
a specific health benefit. Additionally, yoga studies are often 
made up of small sample sizes that lack diversity, and the heavy reliance on self-reporting
makes results subjective. However, there are some health benefits that have more robust scientific 
support than others. Let’s start with flexibility and strength. Twisting your body 
into yoga’s physical postures stretches multiple muscle groups. In the short term, stretching can change
the water content of these muscles, ligaments, and tendons 
to make them more elastic. Over time, regular stretching 
stimulates stem cells which then differentiate 
into new muscle tissue and other cells that generate 
elastic collagen. Frequent stretching also reduces 
the body’s natural reflex to constrict muscles, improving your pain tolerance 
for feats of flexibility. Researchers haven’t found 
that any one form of yoga improves flexibility more than another, so the impact of specific 
postures is unclear. But like other low-impact exercises, yoga reliably improves fitness 
and flexibility in healthy populations. The practice has also been shown to be
a potentially powerful therapeutic tool. In studies involving patients with 
a variety of musculo-skeletal disorders, yoga was more helpful at reducing pain 
and improving mobility than other forms of low-impact exercise. Adding yoga to an existing 
exercise routine can improve strength and flexibility for hard to treat 
conditions like chronic lower back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Yoga’s mix of physical exercise 
and regimented breathing has proven similarly therapeutic 
for lung health. Lung diseases like chronic bronchitis, 
emphysema, and asthma shrink the passageways that carry oxygen, while weakening the membrane 
that brings oxygen into the blood. But breathing exercises 
like those found in yoga relax the muscles constricting 
those passageways and improve oxygen diffusion. Increasing the blood’s oxygen content
is especially helpful for those with weak heart muscles who have difficulty pumping
enough oxygen throughout the body. And for those with healthy hearts, this practice can lower blood pressure
and reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Yoga’s most widely celebrated benefit
may be the most difficult to prove: its psychological effects. Despite the longstanding association 
between yoga and psychological wellbeing, there’s little conclusive evidence 
on how the practice affects mental health. One of the biggest claims is that yoga improves symptoms 
of depression and anxiety disorders. Since diagnosis of these conditions
varies widely as do their origin and severity,
it’s difficult to quantify yoga’s impact. However, there is evidence to suggest that yoga can help reduce 
the symptoms of stress, as well as meditation or relaxation. Research on the effects 
of yoga is still evolving. In the future, we’ll need larger studies, 
incorporating diverse participants, which can measure yoga’s impact
on heart attacks, cancer rates, cognitive function and more. But for now, yoga can continue 
its ancient tradition as a way to exercise, reflect, and relax.

about yoga's advantages. Its unique combination of activities 
makes it difficult to determine which component is producing 
a specific health benefit. Additionally, yoga studies are often 
made up of small sample sizes that lack diversity, and the heavy reliance on self-reporting
makes results subjective. However, there are some health benefits that have more robust scientific 
support than others. Let’s start with flexibility and strength. Twisting your body 
into yoga’s physical postures stretches multiple muscle groups. In the short term, stretching can change
the water content of these muscles, ligaments, and tendons 
to make them more elastic. Over time, regular stretching 
stimulates stem cells which then differentiate 
into new muscle tissue and other cells that generate 
elastic collagen. Frequent stretching also reduces 
the body’s natural reflex to constrict muscles, improving your pain tolerance 
for feats of flexibility. Researchers haven’t found 
that any one form of yoga improves flexibility more than another, so the impact of specific 
postures is unclear. But like other low-impact exercises, yoga reliably improves fitness 
and flexibility in healthy populations. The practice has also been shown to be
a potentially powerful therapeutic tool. In studies involving patients with 
a variety of musculo-skeletal disorders, yoga was more helpful at reducing pain 
and improving mobility than other forms of low-impact exercise. Adding yoga to an existing 
exercise routine can improve strength and flexibility for hard to treat 
conditions like chronic lower back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Yoga’s mix of physical exercise 
and regimented breathing has proven similarly therapeutic 
for lung health. Lung diseases like chronic bronchitis, 
emphysema, and asthma shrink the passageways that carry oxygen, while weakening the membrane 
that brings oxygen into the blood. But breathing exercises 
like those found in yoga relax the muscles constricting 
those passageways and improve oxygen diffusion. Increasing the blood’s oxygen content
is especially helpful for those with weak heart muscles who have difficulty pumping
enough oxygen throughout the body. And for those with healthy hearts, this practice can lower blood pressure
and reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Yoga’s most widely celebrated benefit
may be the most difficult to prove: its psychological effects. Despite the longstanding association 
between yoga and psychological wellbeing, there’s little conclusive evidence 
on how the practice affects mental health. One of the biggest claims is that yoga improves symptoms 
of depression and anxiety disorders. Since diagnosis of these conditions
varies widely as do their origin and severity,
it’s difficult to quantify yoga’s impact. However, there is evidence to suggest that yoga can help reduce 
the symptoms of stress, as well as meditation or relaxation. Research on the effects 
of yoga is still evolving. In the future, we’ll need larger studies, 
incorporating diverse participants, which can measure yoga’s impact
on heart attacks, cancer rates, cognitive function and more. But for now, yoga can continue 
its ancient tradition as a way to exercise, reflect, and relax.

**Transcript**:
At some point between 
the 1st and 5th century CE, the Hindu sage Patañjali began to codify
the ancient, meditative traditions practiced throughout India. He recorded techniques nearly as old 
as Indian civilization itself in 196 manuals called the Yoga Sutras. These texts defined yoga as the ‘yoking’ 
or restraining of the mind from focusing on external objects in efforts to reach a state 
of pure consciousness. Over time, yoga came to incorporate
physical elements from gymnastics and wrestling. Today, there are a multitude of approaches
to modern yoga— though most still maintain the three core
elements of Patañjali’s practice: physical postures, breathing exercises, 
and spiritual contemplation. This blend of physical 
and mental exercise is widely believed to have a unique set 
of health advantages. Such as improving strength
and flexibility, boosting heart and lung function, 
and enhancing psychological well-being. But what have contemporary studies shown

**Transcript**:
Steroids: they’re infamous 
for their use in sports. But they’re also found in inhalers, 
creams to treat poison ivy and eczema, and shots to ease inflammation. The steroids in these medicines aren’t 
the same as the ones used to build muscle. In fact, they’re all based on 
yet another steroid— one our body produces naturally, 
and we can’t live without. Taking a step back, the reason 
there are so many different steroids is because the term refers to substances 
with a shared molecular structure, rather than shared effects on the body. Steroids can be naturally occurring 
or synthetic, but what all steroids have in common 
is a molecular structure that consists of a base of four rings 
made of 17 carbon atoms arranged in three hexagons 
and one pentagon. A molecule must contain 
this exact arrangement to be a steroid, though most also have side chains— additional atoms that can dramatically 
impact the molecule’s function. Steroids get their name 
from the fatty molecule cholesterol. In fact, our bodies make steroids 
out of cholesterol. That fatty cholesterol base 
means that steroids are able to cross fatty cell membranes 
and enter cells. Within the cell, they can directly 
influence gene expression and protein synthesis. This is different from many other types 
of signaling molecules, which can’t cross the cell membrane and have to create their effects 
from outside the cell, through more complicated pathways. So steroids can create their effects 
faster than those other molecules. Back to the steroids 
in anti-inflammatory medications: all of these are based on a naturally 
occurring steroid called cortisol. Cortisol is the body’s 
primary stress signal, and it has a huge range of functions. When we experience a stressor— anything from a fight with a friend, 
to spotting a bear, to an infection or low blood sugar— the brain reacts by sending a signal from 
the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland then sends a signal 
to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands produce cortisol, 
and release some constantly. But when they receive the signal 
from the pituitary gland, they release a burst of cortisol, which spurs the body to generate 
more glucose for energy, decrease functions not immediately 
related to survival, like digestion, and can activate 
a fight-flight-or-freeze response. This is helpful in the short term, 
but can cause undesirable side effects like insomnia and lowered mood 
if they last too long. Cortisol also interacts 
with the immune system in complex ways— depending on the situation, it can increase or decrease 
certain immune functions. In the process of fighting infection, the immune system 
often creates inflammation. Cortisol suppresses the immune system’s 
ability to produce inflammation, which, again, 
can be useful in the short term. But too much cortisol 
can have negative impacts, like reducing the immune system’s ability 
to regenerate bone marrow and lymph nodes. To prevent levels 
from staying high for too long, cortisol suppresses the signal 
that causes the adrenal glands to release more cortisol. Medicinal corticosteroids channel 
cortisol’s effects on the immune system to fight allergic reactions, 
rashes, and asthma. All these things are forms 
of inflammation. There are many synthetic steroids 
that share the same basic mechanism: they enhance the body’s cortisol supply, which in turn shuts down 
the hyperactive immune responses that cause inflammation. These corticosteroids sneak into cells 
and can turn off the “fire alarm” by suppressing gene expression 
of inflammatory signals. The steroids in inhalers and creams impact
only the affected organ— the skin, or the lungs. Intravenous or oral versions, used 
to treat chronic autoimmune conditions like lupus or inflammatory bowel disease, 
impact the whole body. With these conditions, the body’s 
immune system attacks its own cells, a process analogous to a constant 
asthma attack or rash. A constant low dose of steroids can help keep this renegade
immune response under control— but because of the negative psychological 
and physiological effects of longterm exposure, higher doses are reserved 
for emergencies and flare-ups. While an asthma attack, poison ivy welts, 
and irritable bowel syndrome might seem totally unrelated, 
they all have something in common: an immune response 
that’s doing more harm than good. And while corticosteroids 
won’t give you giant muscles, they can be the body’s best defense 
against itself.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Steroids: they’re infamous 
for their use in sports. But they’re also found in inhalers, 
creams to treat poison ivy and eczema, and shots to ease inflammation. The steroids in these medicines aren’t 
the same as the ones used to build muscle. In fact, they’re all based on 
yet another steroid— one our body produces naturally, 
and we can’t live without. Taking a step back, the reason 
there are so many different steroids is because the term refers to substances 
with a shared molecular structure, rather than shared effects on the body. Steroids can be naturally occurring 
or synthetic, but what all steroids have in common 
is a molecular structure that consists of a base of four rings 
made of 17 carbon atoms arranged in three hexagons 
and one pentagon. A molecule must contain 
this exact arrangement to be a steroid, though most also have side chains— additional atoms that can dramatically 
impact the molecule’s function. Steroids get their name 
from the fatty molecule cholesterol. In fact, our bodies make steroids 
out of cholesterol. That fatty cholesterol base 
means that steroids are able to cross fatty cell membranes 
and enter cells. Within the cell, they can directly 
influence gene expression and protein synthesis. This is different from many other types 
of signaling molecules, which can’t cross the cell membrane and have to create their effects 
from outside the cell, through more complicated pathways. So steroids can create their effects 
faster than those other molecules. Back to the steroids 
in anti-inflammatory medications: all of these are based on a naturally 
occurring steroid called cortisol. Cortisol is the body’s 
primary stress signal, and it has a huge range of functions. When we experience a stressor— anything from a fight with a friend, 
to spotting a bear, to an infection or low blood sugar— the brain reacts by sending a signal from 
the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland then sends a signal 
to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands produce cortisol, 
and release some constantly. But when they receive the signal 
from the pituitary gland, they release a burst of cortisol, which spurs the body to generate 
more glucose for energy, decrease functions not immediately 
related to survival, like digestion, and can activate 
a fight-flight-or-freeze response. This is helpful in the short term, 
but can cause undesirable side effects like insomnia and lowered mood 
if they last too long. Cortisol also interacts 
with the immune system in complex ways— depending on the situation, it can increase or decrease 
certain immune functions. In the process of fighting infection, the immune system 
often creates inflammation. Cortisol suppresses the immune system’s 
ability to produce inflammation, which, again, 
can be useful in the short term. But too much cortisol 
can have negative impacts, like reducing the immune system’s ability 
to regenerate bone marrow and lymph nodes. To prevent levels 
from staying high for too long, cortisol suppresses the signal 
that causes the adrenal glands to release more cortisol. Medicinal corticosteroids channel 
cortisol’s effects on the immune system to fight allergic reactions, 
rashes, and asthma. All these things are forms 
of inflammation. There are many synthetic steroids 
that share the same basic mechanism: they enhance the body’s cortisol supply, which in turn shuts down 
the hyperactive immune responses that cause inflammation. These corticosteroids sneak into cells 
and can turn off the “fire alarm” by suppressing gene expression 
of inflammatory signals. The steroids in inhalers and creams impact
only the affected organ— the skin, or the lungs. Intravenous or oral versions, used 
to treat chronic autoimmune conditions like lupus or inflammatory bowel disease, 
impact the whole body. With these conditions, the body’s 
immune system attacks its own cells, a process analogous to a constant 
asthma attack or rash. A constant low dose of steroids can help keep this renegade
immune response under control— but because of the negative psychological 
and physiological effects of longterm exposure, higher doses are reserved 
for emergencies and flare-ups. While an asthma attack, poison ivy welts, 
and irritable bowel syndrome might seem totally unrelated, 
they all have something in common: an immune response 
that’s doing more harm than good. And while corticosteroids 
won’t give you giant muscles, they can be the body’s best defense 
against itself.

**Transcript**:
Steroids: they’re infamous 
for their use in sports. But they’re also found in inhalers, 
creams to treat poison ivy and eczema, and shots to ease inflammation. The steroids in these medicines aren’t 
the same as the ones used to build muscle. In fact, they’re all based on 
yet another steroid— one our body produces naturally, 
and we can’t live without. Taking a step back, the reason 
there are so many different steroids is because the term refers to substances 
with a shared molecular structure, rather than shared effects on the body. Steroids can be naturally occurring 
or synthetic, but what all steroids have in common 
is a molecular structure that consists of a base of four rings 
made of 17 carbon atoms arranged in three hexagons 
and one pentagon. A molecule must contain 
this exact arrangement to be a steroid, though most also have side chains— additional atoms that can dramatically 
impact the molecule’s function. Steroids get their name 
from the fatty molecule cholesterol. In fact, our bodies make steroids 
out of cholesterol. That fatty cholesterol base 
means that steroids are able to cross fatty cell membranes 
and enter cells. Within the cell, they can directly 
influence gene expression and protein synthesis. This is different from many other types 
of signaling molecules, which can’t cross the cell membrane and have to create their effects 
from outside the cell, through more complicated pathways. So steroids can create their effects 
faster than those other molecules. Back to the steroids 
in anti-inflammatory medications: all of these are based on a naturally 
occurring steroid called cortisol. Cortisol is the body’s 
primary stress signal, and it has a huge range of functions. When we experience a stressor— anything from a fight with a friend, 
to spotting a bear, to an infection or low blood sugar— the brain reacts by sending a signal from 
the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland then sends a signal 
to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands produce cortisol, 
and release some constantly. But when they receive the signal 
from the pituitary gland, they release a burst of cortisol, which spurs the body to generate 
more glucose for energy, decrease functions not immediately 
related to survival, like digestion, and can activate 
a fight-flight-or-freeze response. This is helpful in the short term, 
but can cause undesirable side effects like insomnia and lowered mood 
if they last too long. Cortisol also interacts 
with the immune system in complex ways— depending on the situation, it can increase or decrease 
certain immune functions. In the process of fighting infection, the immune system 
often creates inflammation. Cortisol suppresses the immune system’s 
ability to produce inflammation, which, again, 
can be useful in the short term. But too much cortisol 
can have negative impacts, like reducing the immune system’s ability 
to regenerate bone marrow and lymph nodes. To prevent levels 
from staying high for too long, cortisol suppresses the signal 
that causes the adrenal glands to release more cortisol. Medicinal corticosteroids channel 
cortisol’s effects on the immune system to fight allergic reactions, 
rashes, and asthma. All these things are forms 
of inflammation. There are many synthetic steroids 
that share the same basic mechanism: they enhance the body’s cortisol supply, which in turn shuts down 
the hyperactive immune responses that cause inflammation. These corticosteroids sneak into cells 
and can turn off the “fire alarm” by suppressing gene expression 
of inflammatory signals. The steroids in inhalers and creams impact
only the affected organ— the skin, or the lungs. Intravenous or oral versions, used 
to treat chronic autoimmune conditions like lupus or inflammatory bowel disease, 
impact the whole body. With these conditions, the body’s 
immune system attacks its own cells, a process analogous to a constant 
asthma attack or rash. A constant low dose of steroids can help keep this renegade
immune response under control— but because of the negative psychological 
and physiological effects of longterm exposure, higher doses are reserved 
for emergencies and flare-ups. While an asthma attack, poison ivy welts, 
and irritable bowel syndrome might seem totally unrelated, 
they all have something in common: an immune response 
that’s doing more harm than good. And while corticosteroids 
won’t give you giant muscles, they can be the body’s best defense 
against itself.

**Transcript**:
Okay, now I don't want
to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention
that the person to your right is a liar. (Laughter) Also, the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting
in your very seats is a liar. We're all liars. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research
says about why we're all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want
to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building. Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrote
this book, "Liespotting," no one wants to meet me in person
anymore, no, no, no, no, no. They say, "It's okay, we'll email you." (Laughter) I can't even get
a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like, "Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking.
How about French cooking?" So before I get started,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room
that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.
You flared your nostril. I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'
I know you're lying." No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge
of how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature
leaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations
with difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees
to believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point
you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying:
Lying's a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing
participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should
be kept secret, secret. We say, "Nice song." "Honey, you don't look fat in that, no." Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, "You know, I just fished
that email out of my Spam folder. So sorry." But there are times when we are unwilling
participants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone
in the United States. That's an eyelash
under a trillion dollars. That's seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case
of double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,
they can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths
of those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man, Henry Oberlander,
he was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermined the entire
banking system of the Western world. And you can't find this guy on Google;
you can't find him anywhere. He was interviewed once,
and he said the following. He said, "Look, I've got one rule." And this was Henry's rule, he said, "Look, everyone is willing
to give you something. They're ready to give you something
for whatever it is they're hungry for." And that's the crux of it. If you don't want to be
deceived, you have to know, what is it that you're hungry for? And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were
better husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were,
how we wish we could be, with what we're really like. And boy are we willing to fill in
those gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show
that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many of those are white lies. But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes
of meeting each other. (Laughter) Now when we first hear
this data, we recoil. We can't believe how prevalent lying is. We're essentially against lying. But if you look more closely,
the plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers
than we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves
than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're an average married couple, you're going to lie to your spouse
in one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried,
that number drops to three. Lying's complex. It's woven into the fabric
of our daily and our business lives. We're deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because
we don't understand the gaps in our lives. That's truth number two about lying. We're against lying, but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned
for centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture,
it's part of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare,
the Bible, News of the World. (Laughter) Lying has evolutionary value
to us as a species. Researchers have long known
that the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla
who was taught sign language? Koko was taught to communicate
via sign language. Here's Koko with her kitten. It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten
for ripping a sink out of the wall. (Laughter) We're hardwired to become
leaders of the pack. It's starts really, really early. How early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn concealment. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. Five-year-olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom
in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world
and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered
with Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls
a post-truth society. It's been very confusing
for a long time now. What do you do? Well, there are steps we can take
to navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth
90 percent of the time. The rest of us,
we're only 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes.
We all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to show you two patterns of deception. And then we're going
to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. (Video) Bill Clinton:
I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie,
not a single time, never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work
for the American people. Thank you. (Applause) Pamela Meyer: Okay,
what were the telltale signs? Well first we heard what's known
as a non-contracted denial. Studies show that people
who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather
than informal language. We also heard
distancing language: "that woman." We know that liars will unconsciously
distance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said,
"Well, to tell you the truth ..." or Richard Nixon's favorite,
"In all candor ..." he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language, as it's called,
qualifying language like that, further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated
the question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account
with a little too much detail -- and we're all really glad
he didn't do that -- he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said, look,
there's much more to it than speech: "No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent,
he chatters with his fingertips." And we all do it no matter
how powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I'm going to show you
Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips. (Laughter) Now this brings us to our next pattern,
which is body language. With body language,
here's what you've got to do. You've really got to just throw
your assumptions out the door. Let the science temper
your knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars
fidget all the time. Well guess what, they're known to freeze
their upper bodies when they're lying. We think liars won't look you in the eyes. Well guess what, they look
you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles
convey honesty, sincerity. But a trained liespotter
can spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contract
the muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile's in the eyes,
the crow's feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Don't overdo the Botox;
nobody will think you're honest. Now we're going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what's happening
in a conversation? Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words
and someone's actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you're having a conversation
with someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked
but telling of indicators. An honest person
is going to be cooperative. They're going to show
they're on your side. They're going to be enthusiastic. They're going to be willing and helpful
to getting you to the truth. They're going to be willing
to brainstorm, name suspects, provide details. They're going to say, "Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll
that forged those checks." They're going to be infuriated
if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course
of the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout
the entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen
to whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather
than lenient punishment. Now let's say you're having
that exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky. Ask a deceptive person
to tell their story, they're going to pepper it
with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they're going to tell their story
in strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways
over the course of several hours, they will ask that person
to tell that story backwards, and then they'll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce
the highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that?
Well, we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say "yes," we shake our heads "no." We tell very convincing stories,
we slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes, and we smile at the delight
in getting away with it. Now, that smile is known
in the trade as "duping delight." And we're going to see that
in several videos moving forward, but we're going to start --
for those of you who don't know him, this is presidential
candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering
a child out of wedlock. We're going to see him talk
about getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot him
saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no," slightly shrugging his shoulders. (Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy
to participate in one. I know that it's not possible
that this child could be mine, because of the timing of events. So I know it's not possible. Happy to take a paternity test,
and would love to see it happen. Interviewer: Are you going to do
that soon? Is there somebody -- JE: Well, I'm only one side.
I'm only one side of the test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM: Okay, those head shakes
are much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times
when someone makes one expression while masking another that just
kind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner
might shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with you
and then leak an expression of anger. And we're not all going to become
facial expression experts overnight here, but there's one I can teach you
that's very dangerous and it's easy to learn, and that's the expression of contempt. Now with anger, you've got
two people on an even playing field. It's still somewhat
of a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,
you've been dismissed. It's associated with moral superiority. And for that reason, it's very,
very hard to recover from. Here's what it looks like. It's marked by one lip corner
pulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt,
whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way,
go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you." Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures
all over the place all day long. They don't mean anything
in and of themselves. But when you see clusters
of them, that's your signal. Look, listen, probe,
ask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable
mode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode,
ask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person
you're talking to with rapport. Don't try to be like those folks
on "Law & Order" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects
into submission. Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work. Now, we've talked a little bit
about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised, we're now going
to look at what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying,
one is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher
David Matsumoto in California. And I think they're an excellent example
of what the truth looks like. This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital
while they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it. And you'll see when you see the video, she can't even pretend
to be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here
is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes
and her very, very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you'll see
duping delight throughout this video. (Video) Diane Downs:
At night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reaching
her hand out to me while I'm driving, and the blood just kept
coming out of her mouth. And that -- maybe
it'll fade too with time -- but I don't think so. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother,
Erin Runnion, confronting her daughter's murderer
and torturer in court. Here you're going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression
of a mother's agony. (Video) Erin Runnion:
I wrote this statement on the third anniversary
of the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought, and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you
with those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her. And I don't understand it, and I never will. PM: Okay, there's no doubting
the veracity of those emotions. Now the technology
around what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it. We know, for example, that we now have specialized eye trackers
and infrared brain scans, MRI's that can decode the signals
that our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going
to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove
incredibly useful some day. But you've got to ask yourself
in the meantime: Who do you want on your side
of the meeting, someone who's trained
in getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag
a 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door? Liespotters rely on human tools. They know, as someone once said, "Character's who you are in the dark." And what's kind of interesting
is that today, we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 24 hours a day. It's transparent
with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz
of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live
their lives in public. It's a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, that's not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting
can blind us to the fact that the subtleties
of human decency -- character integrity -- that's still what matters,
that's always what's going to matter. So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit
about our moral code. When you combine the science
of recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself
from collaborating in a lie. You start up that path
of being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, "Hey, my world, our world,
it's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be
one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized
and marginalized." And when you do that, the ground around you starts
to shift just a little bit. And that's the truth. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Okay, now I don't want
to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention
that the person to your right is a liar. (Laughter) Also, the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting
in your very seats is a liar. We're all liars. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research
says about why we're all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want
to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building. Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrote
this book, "Liespotting," no one wants to meet me in person
anymore, no, no, no, no, no. They say, "It's okay, we'll email you." (Laughter) I can't even get
a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like, "Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking.
How about French cooking?" So before I get started,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room
that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.
You flared your nostril. I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'
I know you're lying." No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge
of how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature
leaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations
with difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees
to believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point
you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying:
Lying's a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing
participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should
be kept secret, secret. We say, "Nice song." "Honey, you don't look fat in that, no." Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, "You know, I just fished
that email out of my Spam folder. So sorry." But there are times when we are unwilling
participants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone
in the United States. That's an eyelash
under a trillion dollars. That's seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case
of double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,
they can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths
of those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man, Henry Oberlander,
he was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermined the entire
banking system of the Western world. And you can't find this guy on Google;
you can't find him anywhere. He was interviewed once,
and he said the following. He said, "Look, I've got one rule." And this was Henry's rule, he said, "Look, everyone is willing
to give you something. They're ready to give you something
for whatever it is they're hungry for." And that's the crux of it. If you don't want to be
deceived, you have to know, what is it that you're hungry for? And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were
better husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were,
how we wish we could be, with what we're really like. And boy are we willing to fill in
those gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show
that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many of those are white lies. But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes
of meeting each other. (Laughter) Now when we first hear
this data, we recoil. We can't believe how prevalent lying is. We're essentially against lying. But if you look more closely,
the plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers
than we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves
than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're an average married couple, you're going to lie to your spouse
in one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried,
that number drops to three. Lying's complex. It's woven into the fabric
of our daily and our business lives. We're deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because
we don't understand the gaps in our lives. That's truth number two about lying. We're against lying, but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned
for centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture,
it's part of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare,
the Bible, News of the World. (Laughter) Lying has evolutionary value
to us as a species. Researchers have long known
that the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla
who was taught sign language? Koko was taught to communicate
via sign language. Here's Koko with her kitten. It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten
for ripping a sink out of the wall. (Laughter) We're hardwired to become
leaders of the pack. It's starts really, really early. How early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn concealment. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. Five-year-olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom
in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world
and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered
with Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls
a post-truth society. It's been very confusing
for a long time now. What do you do? Well, there are steps we can take
to navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth
90 percent of the time. The rest of us,
we're only 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes.
We all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to show you two patterns of deception. And then we're going
to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. (Video) Bill Clinton:
I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie,
not a single time, never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work
for the American people. Thank you. (Applause) Pamela Meyer: Okay,
what were the telltale signs? Well first we heard what's known
as a non-contracted denial. Studies show that people
who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather
than informal language. We also heard
distancing language: "that woman." We know that liars will unconsciously
distance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said,
"Well, to tell you the truth ..." or Richard Nixon's favorite,
"In all candor ..." he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language, as it's called,
qualifying language like that, further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated
the question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account
with a little too much detail -- and we're all really glad
he didn't do that -- he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said, look,
there's much more to it than speech: "No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent,
he chatters with his fingertips." And we all do it no matter
how powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I'm going to show you
Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips. (Laughter) Now this brings us to our next pattern,
which is body language. With body language,
here's what you've got to do. You've really got to just throw
your assumptions out the door. Let the science temper
your knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars
fidget all the time. Well guess what, they're known to freeze
their upper bodies when they're lying. We think liars won't look you in the eyes. Well guess what, they look
you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles
convey honesty, sincerity. But a trained liespotter
can spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contract
the muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile's in the eyes,
the crow's feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Don't overdo the Botox;
nobody will think you're honest. Now we're going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what's happening
in a conversation? Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words
and someone's actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you're having a conversation
with someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked
but telling of indicators. An honest person
is going to be cooperative. They're going to show
they're on your side. They're going to be enthusiastic. They're going to be willing and helpful
to getting you to the truth. They're going to be willing
to brainstorm, name suspects, provide details. They're going to say, "Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll
that forged those checks." They're going to be infuriated
if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course
of the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout
the entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen
to whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather
than lenient punishment. Now let's say you're having
that exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky. Ask a deceptive person
to tell their story, they're going to pepper it
with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they're going to tell their story
in strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways
over the course of several hours, they will ask that person
to tell that story backwards, and then they'll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce
the highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that?
Well, we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say "yes," we shake our heads "no." We tell very convincing stories,

go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you." Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures

**Transcript**:
Okay, now I don't want
to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention
that the person to your right is a liar. (Laughter) Also, the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting
in your very seats is a liar. We're all liars. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research
says about why we're all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want
to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building. Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrote
this book, "Liespotting," no one wants to meet me in person
anymore, no, no, no, no, no. They say, "It's okay, we'll email you." (Laughter) I can't even get
a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like, "Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking.
How about French cooking?" So before I get started,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room
that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.
You flared your nostril. I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'
I know you're lying." No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge
of how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature
leaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations
with difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees
to believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point
you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying:
Lying's a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing
participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should
be kept secret, secret. We say, "Nice song." "Honey, you don't look fat in that, no." Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, "You know, I just fished
that email out of my Spam folder. So sorry." But there are times when we are unwilling
participants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone
in the United States. That's an eyelash
under a trillion dollars. That's seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case
of double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,
they can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths
of those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man, Henry Oberlander,
he was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermined the entire
banking system of the Western world. And you can't find this guy on Google;
you can't find him anywhere. He was interviewed once,
and he said the following. He said, "Look, I've got one rule." And this was Henry's rule, he said, "Look, everyone is willing
to give you something. They're ready to give you something
for whatever it is they're hungry for." And that's the crux of it. If you don't want to be
deceived, you have to know, what is it that you're hungry for? And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were
better husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were,
how we wish we could be, with what we're really like. And boy are we willing to fill in
those gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show
that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many of those are white lies. But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes
of meeting each other. (Laughter) Now when we first hear
this data, we recoil. We can't believe how prevalent lying is. We're essentially against lying. But if you look more closely,
the plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers
than we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves
than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're an average married couple, you're going to lie to your spouse
in one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried,
that number drops to three. Lying's complex. It's woven into the fabric
of our daily and our business lives. We're deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because
we don't understand the gaps in our lives. That's truth number two about lying. We're against lying, but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned
for centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture,
it's part of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare,
the Bible, News of the World. (Laughter) Lying has evolutionary value
to us as a species. Researchers have long known
that the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla
who was taught sign language? Koko was taught to communicate
via sign language. Here's Koko with her kitten. It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten
for ripping a sink out of the wall. (Laughter) We're hardwired to become
leaders of the pack. It's starts really, really early. How early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn concealment. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. Five-year-olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom
in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world
and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered
with Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls
a post-truth society. It's been very confusing
for a long time now. What do you do? Well, there are steps we can take
to navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth
90 percent of the time. The rest of us,
we're only 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes.
We all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to show you two patterns of deception. And then we're going
to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. (Video) Bill Clinton:
I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie,
not a single time, never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work
for the American people. Thank you. (Applause) Pamela Meyer: Okay,
what were the telltale signs? Well first we heard what's known
as a non-contracted denial. Studies show that people
who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather
than informal language. We also heard
distancing language: "that woman." We know that liars will unconsciously
distance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said,
"Well, to tell you the truth ..." or Richard Nixon's favorite,
"In all candor ..." he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language, as it's called,
qualifying language like that, further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated
the question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account
with a little too much detail -- and we're all really glad
he didn't do that -- he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said, look,
there's much more to it than speech: "No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent,
he chatters with his fingertips." And we all do it no matter
how powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I'm going to show you
Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips. (Laughter) Now this brings us to our next pattern,
which is body language. With body language,
here's what you've got to do. You've really got to just throw
your assumptions out the door. Let the science temper
your knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars
fidget all the time. Well guess what, they're known to freeze
their upper bodies when they're lying. We think liars won't look you in the eyes. Well guess what, they look
you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles
convey honesty, sincerity. But a trained liespotter
can spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contract
the muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile's in the eyes,
the crow's feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Don't overdo the Botox;
nobody will think you're honest. Now we're going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what's happening
in a conversation? Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words
and someone's actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you're having a conversation
with someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked
but telling of indicators. An honest person
is going to be cooperative. They're going to show
they're on your side. They're going to be enthusiastic. They're going to be willing and helpful
to getting you to the truth. They're going to be willing
to brainstorm, name suspects, provide details. They're going to say, "Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll
that forged those checks." They're going to be infuriated
if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course
of the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout
the entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen
to whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather
than lenient punishment. Now let's say you're having
that exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky. Ask a deceptive person
to tell their story, they're going to pepper it
with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they're going to tell their story
in strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways
over the course of several hours, they will ask that person
to tell that story backwards, and then they'll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce
the highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that?
Well, we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say "yes," we shake our heads "no." We tell very convincing stories,
we slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes, and we smile at the delight
in getting away with it. Now, that smile is known
in the trade as "duping delight." And we're going to see that
in several videos moving forward, but we're going to start --
for those of you who don't know him, this is presidential
candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering
a child out of wedlock. We're going to see him talk
about getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot him
saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no," slightly shrugging his shoulders. (Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy
to participate in one. I know that it's not possible
that this child could be mine, because of the timing of events. So I know it's not possible. Happy to take a paternity test,
and would love to see it happen. Interviewer: Are you going to do
that soon? Is there somebody -- JE: Well, I'm only one side.
I'm only one side of the test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM: Okay, those head shakes
are much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times
when someone makes one expression while masking another that just
kind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner
might shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with you
and then leak an expression of anger. And we're not all going to become
facial expression experts overnight here, but there's one I can teach you
that's very dangerous and it's easy to learn, and that's the expression of contempt. Now with anger, you've got
two people on an even playing field. It's still somewhat
of a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,
you've been dismissed. It's associated with moral superiority. And for that reason, it's very,
very hard to recover from. Here's what it looks like. It's marked by one lip corner
pulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt,
whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way,
go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you." Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures
all over the place all day long. They don't mean anything
in and of themselves. But when you see clusters
of them, that's your signal. Look, listen, probe,
ask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable
mode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode,
ask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person
you're talking to with rapport. Don't try to be like those folks
on "Law & Order" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects
into submission. Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work. Now, we've talked a little bit
about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised, we're now going
to look at what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying,
one is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher
David Matsumoto in California. And I think they're an excellent example
of what the truth looks like. This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital
while they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it. And you'll see when you see the video, she can't even pretend
to be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here
is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes
and her very, very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you'll see
duping delight throughout this video. (Video) Diane Downs:
At night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reaching
her hand out to me while I'm driving, and the blood just kept
coming out of her mouth. And that -- maybe
it'll fade too with time -- but I don't think so. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother,
Erin Runnion, confronting her daughter's murderer
and torturer in court. Here you're going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression
of a mother's agony. (Video) Erin Runnion:
I wrote this statement on the third anniversary
of the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought, and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you
with those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her. And I don't understand it, and I never will. PM: Okay, there's no doubting
the veracity of those emotions. Now the technology
around what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it. We know, for example, that we now have specialized eye trackers
and infrared brain scans, MRI's that can decode the signals
that our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going
to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove
incredibly useful some day. But you've got to ask yourself
in the meantime: Who do you want on your side
of the meeting, someone who's trained
in getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag
a 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door? Liespotters rely on human tools. They know, as someone once said, "Character's who you are in the dark." And what's kind of interesting
is that today, we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 24 hours a day. It's transparent
with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz
of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live
their lives in public. It's a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, that's not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting
can blind us to the fact that the subtleties
of human decency -- character integrity -- that's still what matters,
that's always what's going to matter. So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit
about our moral code. When you combine the science
of recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself
from collaborating in a lie. You start up that path
of being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, "Hey, my world, our world,
it's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be
one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized
and marginalized." And when you do that, the ground around you starts
to shift just a little bit. And that's the truth. Thank you. (Applause)

can spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contract
the muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile's in the eyes,
the crow's feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Don't overdo the Botox;
nobody will think you're honest. Now we're going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what's happening
in a conversation? Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words
and someone's actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you're having a conversation
with someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked
but telling of indicators. An honest person
is going to be cooperative. They're going to show
they're on your side. They're going to be enthusiastic. They're going to be willing and helpful
to getting you to the truth. They're going to be willing
to brainstorm, name suspects, provide details. They're going to say, "Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll
that forged those checks." They're going to be infuriated
if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course
of the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout
the entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen
to whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather
than lenient punishment. Now let's say you're having
that exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky. Ask a deceptive person
to tell their story, they're going to pepper it
with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they're going to tell their story
in strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways
over the course of several hours, they will ask that person
to tell that story backwards, and then they'll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce
the highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that?
Well, we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say "yes," we shake our heads "no." We tell very convincing stories,
we slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes, and we smile at the delight
in getting away with it. Now, that smile is known
in the trade as "duping delight." And we're going to see that
in several videos moving forward, but we're going to start --
for those of you who don't know him, this is presidential
candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering
a child out of wedlock. We're going to see him talk
about getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot him
saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no," slightly shrugging his shoulders. (Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy
to participate in one. I know that it's not possible
that this child could be mine, because of the timing of events. So I know it's not possible. Happy to take a paternity test,
and would love to see it happen. Interviewer: Are you going to do
that soon? Is there somebody -- JE: Well, I'm only one side.
I'm only one side of the test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM: Okay, those head shakes
are much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times
when someone makes one expression while masking another that just
kind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner
might shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with you
and then leak an expression of anger. And we're not all going to become
facial expression experts overnight here, but there's one I can teach you
that's very dangerous and it's easy to learn, and that's the expression of contempt. Now with anger, you've got
two people on an even playing field. It's still somewhat
of a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,
you've been dismissed. It's associated with moral superiority. And for that reason, it's very,
very hard to recover from. Here's what it looks like. It's marked by one lip corner
pulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt,
whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way,
go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you." Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures
all over the place all day long. They don't mean anything
in and of themselves. But when you see clusters
of them, that's your signal. Look, listen, probe,
ask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable
mode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode,
ask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person
you're talking to with rapport. Don't try to be like those folks
on "Law & Order" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects
into submission. Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work. Now, we've talked a little bit
about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised, we're now going
to look at what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying,
one is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher
David Matsumoto in California. And I think they're an excellent example
of what the truth looks like. This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital
while they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it. And you'll see when you see the video, she can't even pretend
to be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here
is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes
and her very, very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you'll see
duping delight throughout this video. (Video) Diane Downs:
At night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reaching
her hand out to me while I'm driving, and the blood just kept
coming out of her mouth. And that -- maybe
it'll fade too with time -- but I don't think so. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother,
Erin Runnion, confronting her daughter's murderer
and torturer in court. Here you're going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression
of a mother's agony. (Video) Erin Runnion:
I wrote this statement on the third anniversary
of the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought, and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you
with those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her. And I don't understand it, and I never will. PM: Okay, there's no doubting
the veracity of those emotions. Now the technology
around what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it. We know, for example, that we now have specialized eye trackers
and infrared brain scans, MRI's that can decode the signals
that our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going
to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove
incredibly useful some day. But you've got to ask yourself
in the meantime: Who do you want on your side
of the meeting, someone who's trained
in getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag
a 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door? Liespotters rely on human tools. They know, as someone once said, "Character's who you are in the dark." And what's kind of interesting
is that today, we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 24 hours a day. It's transparent
with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz
of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live
their lives in public. It's a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, that's not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting
can blind us to the fact that the subtleties
of human decency -- character integrity -- that's still what matters,
that's always what's going to matter. So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit
about our moral code. When you combine the science
of recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself
from collaborating in a lie. You start up that path
of being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, "Hey, my world, our world,
it's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be
one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized
and marginalized." And when you do that, the ground around you starts
to shift just a little bit. And that's the truth. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Okay, now I don't want
to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention
that the person to your right is a liar. (Laughter) Also, the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting
in your very seats is a liar. We're all liars. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research
says about why we're all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want
to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building. Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrote
this book, "Liespotting," no one wants to meet me in person
anymore, no, no, no, no, no. They say, "It's okay, we'll email you." (Laughter) I can't even get
a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like, "Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking.
How about French cooking?" So before I get started,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room
that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.
You flared your nostril. I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'
I know you're lying." No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge
of how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature
leaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations
with difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees
to believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point
you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying:
Lying's a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing
participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should
be kept secret, secret. We say, "Nice song." "Honey, you don't look fat in that, no." Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, "You know, I just fished
that email out of my Spam folder. So sorry." But there are times when we are unwilling
participants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone
in the United States. That's an eyelash
under a trillion dollars. That's seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case
of double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,
they can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths
of those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man, Henry Oberlander,
he was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermined the entire
banking system of the Western world. And you can't find this guy on Google;
you can't find him anywhere. He was interviewed once,
and he said the following. He said, "Look, I've got one rule." And this was Henry's rule, he said, "Look, everyone is willing
to give you something. They're ready to give you something
for whatever it is they're hungry for." And that's the crux of it. If you don't want to be
deceived, you have to know, what is it that you're hungry for? And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were
better husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were,
how we wish we could be, with what we're really like. And boy are we willing to fill in
those gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show
that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many of those are white lies. But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes
of meeting each other. (Laughter) Now when we first hear
this data, we recoil. We can't believe how prevalent lying is. We're essentially against lying. But if you look more closely,
the plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers
than we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves
than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're an average married couple, you're going to lie to your spouse
in one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried,
that number drops to three. Lying's complex. It's woven into the fabric
of our daily and our business lives. We're deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because
we don't understand the gaps in our lives. That's truth number two about lying. We're against lying, but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned
for centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture,
it's part of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare,
the Bible, News of the World. (Laughter) Lying has evolutionary value
to us as a species. Researchers have long known
that the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla
who was taught sign language? Koko was taught to communicate
via sign language. Here's Koko with her kitten. It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten
for ripping a sink out of the wall. (Laughter) We're hardwired to become
leaders of the pack. It's starts really, really early. How early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn concealment. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. Five-year-olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom
in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world
and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered
with Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls
a post-truth society. It's been very confusing
for a long time now. What do you do? Well, there are steps we can take
to navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth
90 percent of the time. The rest of us,
we're only 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes.
We all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to show you two patterns of deception. And then we're going
to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. (Video) Bill Clinton:
I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie,
not a single time, never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work
for the American people. Thank you. (Applause) Pamela Meyer: Okay,
what were the telltale signs? Well first we heard what's known
as a non-contracted denial. Studies show that people
who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather
than informal language. We also heard
distancing language: "that woman." We know that liars will unconsciously
distance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said,
"Well, to tell you the truth ..." or Richard Nixon's favorite,
"In all candor ..." he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language, as it's called,
qualifying language like that, further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated
the question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account
with a little too much detail -- and we're all really glad
he didn't do that -- he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said, look,
there's much more to it than speech: "No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent,
he chatters with his fingertips." And we all do it no matter
how powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I'm going to show you
Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips. (Laughter) Now this brings us to our next pattern,
which is body language. With body language,
here's what you've got to do. You've really got to just throw
your assumptions out the door. Let the science temper
your knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars
fidget all the time. Well guess what, they're known to freeze
their upper bodies when they're lying. We think liars won't look you in the eyes. Well guess what, they look
you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles
convey honesty, sincerity. But a trained liespotter
can spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contract
the muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile's in the eyes,
the crow's feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Don't overdo the Botox;
nobody will think you're honest. Now we're going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what's happening
in a conversation? Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words
and someone's actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you're having a conversation
with someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked
but telling of indicators. An honest person
is going to be cooperative. They're going to show
they're on your side. They're going to be enthusiastic. They're going to be willing and helpful
to getting you to the truth. They're going to be willing
to brainstorm, name suspects, provide details. They're going to say, "Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll
that forged those checks." They're going to be infuriated
if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course
of the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout
the entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen
to whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather
than lenient punishment. Now let's say you're having
that exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky. Ask a deceptive person
to tell their story, they're going to pepper it
with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they're going to tell their story
in strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways

for just one more nightcap. Thank you." Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 5, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
When a new pathogen emerges, our bodies and healthcare systems
are left vulnerable. In times like these,
there’s an urgent need for a vaccine to create widespread immunity
with minimal loss of life. So how quickly can we develop vaccines
when we need them most? Vaccine development can generally 
be split into three phases. In exploratory research, scientists 
experiment with different approaches to find safe and replicable 
vaccine designs. Once these are vetted in the lab, 
they enter clinical testing, where vaccines are evaluated 
for safety, efficacy, and side effects across a variety of populations. Finally, there’s manufacturing, where vaccines are produced 
and distributed for public use. Under regular circumstances, this process
takes an average of 15 to 20 years. But during a pandemic, 
researchers employ numerous strategies to move through each stage 
as quickly as possible. Exploratory research is perhaps 
the most flexible. The goal of this stage 
is to find a safe way to introduce our immune system 
to the virus or bacteria. This gives our body the information
it needs to create antibodies capable of fighting a real infection. There are many ways to safely trigger
this immune response, but generally, the most effective 
designs are also the slowest to produce. Traditional attenuated vaccines 
create long lasting resilience. But they rely on weakened viral strains that must be cultivated in non-human
tissue over long periods of time. Inactivated vaccines take 
a much faster approach, directly applying heat, acid, or radiation
to weaken the pathogen. Sub-unit vaccines, that inject 
harmless fragments of viral proteins, can also be created quickly. But these faster techniques produce
less robust resilience. These are just three 
of many vaccine designs, each with their own pros and cons. No single approach is guaranteed to work, and all of them require 
time-consuming research. So the best way to speed things up 
is for many labs to work on different models 
simultaneously. This race-to-the-finish strategy produced the first testable 
Zika vaccine in 7 months, and the first testable COVID-19 vaccine
in just 42 days. Being testable doesn’t mean 
these vaccines will be successful. But models that are deemed safe 
and easily replicable can move into clinical testing while other
labs continue exploring alternatives. Whether a testable vaccine is produced
in four months or four years, the next stage is often the longest and 
most unpredictable stage of development. Clinical testing consists of three phases,
each containing multiple trials. Phase I trials focus on the intensity 
of the triggered immune response, and try to establish that the vaccine 
is safe and effective. Phase II trials focus on determining 
the right dosage and delivery schedule across a wider population. And Phase III trials determine safety across the vaccine’s primary 
use population, while also identifying rare side effects
and negative reactions. Given the number of variables 
and the focus on long-term safety, it’s incredibly difficult to speed up 
clinical testing. In extreme circumstances, 
researchers run multiple trials within one phase at the same time. But they still need to meet 
strict safety criteria before moving on. Occasionally, labs can expedite 
this process by leveraging previously approved treatments. In 2009, researchers adapted 
the seasonal flu vaccine to treat H1N1— producing a widely available vaccine
in just six months. However, this technique only works
when dealing with familiar pathogens that have well-established 
vaccine designs. After a successful Phase III trial, 
a national regulatory authority reviews the results and approves 
safe vaccines for manufacturing. Every vaccine has a unique blend 
of biological and chemical components that require a specialized pipeline 
to produce. To start production as soon 
as the vaccine is approved, manufacturing plans must be designed
in parallel to research and testing. This requires constant coordination
between labs and manufacturers, as well as the resources to adapt
to sudden changes in vaccine design— even if that means scrapping
months of work. Over time, advances in exploratory
research and manufacturing should make this process faster. Preliminary studies suggest 
that future researchers may be able to swap genetic material
from different viruses into the same vaccine design. These DNA and mRNA based vaccines
could dramatically expedite all three stages of vaccine production. But until such breakthroughs arrive, our best strategy is for labs 
around the world to cooperate and work in parallel 
on different approaches. By sharing knowledge and resources, scientists can divide and conquer 
any pathogen.

when we need them most? Vaccine development can generally 
be split into three phases. In exploratory research, scientists 
experiment with different approaches to find safe and replicable 
vaccine designs. Once these are vetted in the lab, 
they enter clinical testing, where vaccines are evaluated 
for safety, efficacy, and side effects across a variety of populations. Finally, there’s manufacturing, where vaccines are produced 
and distributed for public use. Under regular circumstances, this process
takes an average of 15 to 20 years. But during a pandemic, 
researchers employ numerous strategies to move through each stage 
as quickly as possible. Exploratory research is perhaps 
the most flexible. The goal of this stage 
is to find a safe way to introduce our immune system 
to the virus or bacteria. This gives our body the information
it needs to create antibodies capable of fighting a real infection. There are many ways to safely trigger
this immune response, but generally, the most effective 
designs are also the slowest to produce. Traditional attenuated vaccines 
create long lasting resilience. But they rely on weakened viral strains that must be cultivated in non-human
tissue over long periods of time. Inactivated vaccines take 
a much faster approach, directly applying heat, acid, or radiation
to weaken the pathogen. Sub-unit vaccines, that inject 
harmless fragments of viral proteins, can also be created quickly. But these faster techniques produce
less robust resilience. These are just three 
of many vaccine designs, each with their own pros and cons. No single approach is guaranteed to work, and all of them require 
time-consuming research. So the best way to speed things up 
is for many labs to work on different models 
simultaneously. This race-to-the-finish strategy produced the first testable 
Zika vaccine in 7 months, and the first testable COVID-19 vaccine
in just 42 days. Being testable doesn’t mean 
these vaccines will be successful. But models that are deemed safe 
and easily replicable can move into clinical testing while other
labs continue exploring alternatives. Whether a testable vaccine is produced
in four months or four years, the next stage is often the longest and 
most unpredictable stage of development. Clinical testing consists of three phases,
each containing multiple trials. Phase I trials focus on the intensity 
of the triggered immune response, and try to establish that the vaccine 
is safe and effective. Phase II trials focus on determining 
the right dosage and delivery schedule across a wider population. And Phase III trials determine safety across the vaccine’s primary 
use population, while also identifying rare side effects
and negative reactions. Given the number of variables 
and the focus on long-term safety, it’s incredibly difficult to speed up 
clinical testing. In extreme circumstances, 
researchers run multiple trials within one phase at the same time. But they still need to meet 
strict safety criteria before moving on. Occasionally, labs can expedite 
this process by leveraging previously approved treatments. In 2009, researchers adapted 
the seasonal flu vaccine to treat H1N1— producing a widely available vaccine
in just six months. However, this technique only works
when dealing with familiar pathogens that have well-established 
vaccine designs. After a successful Phase III trial, 
a national regulatory authority reviews the results and approves 
safe vaccines for manufacturing. Every vaccine has a unique blend 
of biological and chemical components that require a specialized pipeline 
to produce. To start production as soon 
as the vaccine is approved, manufacturing plans must be designed
in parallel to research and testing. This requires constant coordination
between labs and manufacturers, as well as the resources to adapt
to sudden changes in vaccine design— even if that means scrapping
months of work. Over time, advances in exploratory
research and manufacturing should make this process faster. Preliminary studies suggest 
that future researchers may be able to swap genetic material
from different viruses into the same vaccine design. These DNA and mRNA based vaccines
could dramatically expedite all three stages of vaccine production. But until such breakthroughs arrive, our best strategy is for labs 
around the world to cooperate and work in parallel 
on different approaches. By sharing knowledge and resources, scientists can divide and conquer 
any pathogen.

**Transcript**:
[Music] Picture a polar bear...in the desert. No, what you're imagining is way too cute. Take off the sunglasses and the swim trunks. There. He's hot. He's hungry. He's downright miserable. Why is he such a grumpy bear? Well, it's because he's not where he belongs. There aren't any tasty seals to eat, 
no cold water to enjoy, and no snow to sleep in. The desert isn't his habitat. You know that a habitat is 
the area where something lives, but from polar bears to porcupines, 
animals don't just need a place to live -- they also rely on the other living and 
non-living things around them to survive. And life looks different in 
different places around the world. So, what makes a habitat a home? Well, what do you need? I need sandwiches, pancakes, 
carrots, maybe some nice peaches... so I need food, and I need water. 
I need a place to live. And I need a place to film Crash Course videos. You could say this is my habitat. Animals need these things, too! Food, water, shelter, and space to live. For animals, their food comes 
from their neighbors, the other living things in their habitat. You know that plants and animals all 
fall somewhere along the food chain, which is a model we use to describe 
the flow of energy between living things. But the real world is made up of 
lots and lots of food chains, and those chains can get kind of messy. I mean, look at our polar bear. Sure, 
his favorite food is seal, but in a pinch, he'll eat walrus, dead whales, bird's eggs, 
and if he has absolutely no other choice, plants. The polar bear is at the top of 
multiple food chains, and that's not unusual -- most animals 
don't just eat one thing, and neither do I. I'm at the top of the pancake food 
chain and the carrot food chain. It just so happens I prefer pancakes. So, you can see how food chains are actually 
all tangled around with each other, with many different ones overlapping, 
kind of like a web. So, we call this a "food web." Food webs are big, tangled systems that include 
every plant and animal in a habitat. And, as you might guess, 
all food webs are different. Let's compare two different habitats 
to see how the food webs play out. First, we'll go back to our old stomping ground: the forest. Let's begin with (you know
 this, people!) the plants: trees, grass, and other plants that 
change energy from the sun into sugar. But then you have some animals 
that eat other animals. This is where things get a little more complicated. Today, an owl makes a mouse his lunch,
but tomorrow it may be a rabbit. Today, a snake snacks on a squirrel, 
but a few days later, our owl friend might make a meal of 
another meat eater, like the snake. Finally, the decomposers: 
insects, fungi, and bacteria are breaking down whatever's left over --
from uneaten, rotten fruit to leftover animal carcasses. As they break down matter, they provide more nutrients for the plants. It's a bit of a different story up in 
the Arctic. I mean, look at all that ice! I know what you're thinking: 
where are the plants? How do we have a food web without plants? Zoom in on the sea water. 
Zoom way in-- further, further, stop! Can you see those tiny plants? 
They're called phytoplankton. And just like plants on land, 
they convert energy from the sun. Really small creatures called zooplankton 
eat the phytoplankton. And all kinds of small fish 
dine on the zooplankton. Larger fish eat the smaller fish. There are big marine mammals, too. Beluga whales eat fish, while humpback whales 
eat the tiny plankton and krill. And what else eats fish? Seals. 
That's our polar bear's favorite food, but up here, you can't afford to be picky, so he may 
have to nibble on some whale carcass if necessary. As for decomposers, there aren't many 
bugs or earthworms in this cold climate. There are bacteria, but since it's so cold, the decomposers break down matter 
much more slowly than in the forest. So, you can see, food webs 
and the ecosystems that support them look different in different parts of the world, depending on the habitat conditions. Flat or mountainous land, 
more or less water... these seemingly small changes in habitats 
affect what kind of plants and animals live there. Up in the Arctic, a polar bear has the right conditions to keep him happy. First, he fits into his food web perfectly. The food that's available to him has enough 
fat and protein to keep his energy up. Second, he fits into his habitat perfectly. He has the body adaptations to not just survive, 
but feel really comfortable in the super cold. A polar bear isn't built to survive 
in the desert or the forest. So, let's put our poor polar bear 
back where he belongs. I was starting to feel bad for the guy!

**Transcript**:
[Music] Picture a polar bear...in the desert. No, what you're imagining is way too cute. Take off the sunglasses and the swim trunks. There. He's hot. He's hungry. He's downright miserable. Why is he such a grumpy bear? Well, it's because he's not where he belongs. There aren't any tasty seals to eat, 
no cold water to enjoy, and no snow to sleep in. The desert isn't his habitat. You know that a habitat is 
the area where something lives, but from polar bears to porcupines, 
animals don't just need a place to live -- they also rely on the other living and 
non-living things around them to survive. And life looks different in 
different places around the world. So, what makes a habitat a home? Well, what do you need? I need sandwiches, pancakes, 
carrots, maybe some nice peaches... so I need food, and I need water. 
I need a place to live. And I need a place to film Crash Course videos. You could say this is my habitat. Animals need these things, too! Food, water, shelter, and space to live. For animals, their food comes 
from their neighbors, the other living things in their habitat. You know that plants and animals all 
fall somewhere along the food chain, which is a model we use to describe 
the flow of energy between living things. But the real world is made up of 
lots and lots of food chains, and those chains can get kind of messy. I mean, look at our polar bear. Sure, 
his favorite food is seal, but in a pinch, he'll eat walrus, dead whales, bird's eggs, 
and if he has absolutely no other choice, plants. The polar bear is at the top of 
multiple food chains, and that's not unusual -- most animals 
don't just eat one thing, and neither do I. I'm at the top of the pancake food 
chain and the carrot food chain. It just so happens I prefer pancakes. So, you can see how food chains are actually 
all tangled around with each other, with many different ones overlapping, 
kind of like a web. So, we call this a "food web." Food webs are big, tangled systems that include 
every plant and animal in a habitat. And, as you might guess, 
all food webs are different. Let's compare two different habitats 
to see how the food webs play out. First, we'll go back to our old stomping ground: the forest. Let's begin with (you know
 this, people!) the plants: trees, grass, and other plants that 
change energy from the sun into sugar. But then you have some animals 
that eat other animals. This is where things get a little more complicated. Today, an owl makes a mouse his lunch,
but tomorrow it may be a rabbit. Today, a snake snacks on a squirrel, 
but a few days later, our owl friend might make a meal of 
another meat eater, like the snake. Finally, the decomposers: 
insects, fungi, and bacteria are breaking down whatever's left over --
from uneaten, rotten fruit to leftover animal carcasses. As they break down matter, they provide more nutrients for the plants. It's a bit of a different story up in 
the Arctic. I mean, look at all that ice! I know what you're thinking: 
where are the plants? How do we have a food web without plants? Zoom in on the sea water. 
Zoom way in-- further, further, stop! Can you see those tiny plants? 
They're called phytoplankton. And just like plants on land, 
they convert energy from the sun. Really small creatures called zooplankton 
eat the phytoplankton. And all kinds of small fish 
dine on the zooplankton. Larger fish eat the smaller fish. There are big marine mammals, too. Beluga whales eat fish, while humpback whales 
eat the tiny plankton and krill. And what else eats fish? Seals. 
That's our polar bear's favorite food, but up here, you can't afford to be picky, so he may 
have to nibble on some whale carcass if necessary. As for decomposers, there aren't many 
bugs or earthworms in this cold climate. There are bacteria, but since it's so cold, the decomposers break down matter 
much more slowly than in the forest. So, you can see, food webs 
and the ecosystems that support them look different in different parts of the world, depending on the habitat conditions. Flat or mountainous land, 
more or less water... these seemingly small changes in habitats 
affect what kind of plants and animals live there. Up in the Arctic, a polar bear has the right conditions to keep him happy. First, he fits into his food web perfectly. The food that's available to him has enough 
fat and protein to keep his energy up. Second, he fits into his habitat perfectly. He has the body adaptations to not just survive, 
but feel really comfortable in the super cold. A polar bear isn't built to survive 
in the desert or the forest. So, let's put our poor polar bear 
back where he belongs. I was starting to feel bad for the guy!

**Transcript**:
[music] We all know that we have to eat different
kinds of food to get the nutrition that we need. So eating plants is a great idea if you want
to be healthy. That’s why I like to eat things like carrots, and spinach and tomatoes. I like to eat plants, but what if plants...
tried to eat animals? Well, there are actually a few kinds of plants
that are carnivorous, meaning they eat meat. Now when I say meat, I’m not talking about
chicken nuggets or hamburgers. I’m talking about really small animals,
like insects, spiders, and frogs. Creatures like these have to be extra careful
around meat-eating plants! Probably the most famous carnivorous plant
is known as the Venus Flytrap. Venus Flytraps have leaves at the tops of
their stems that kind of look like tiny, toothy mouths. They’re not really mouths, but they serve
the same purpose: to eat flies, and other insects. Usually, the trap’s leaves are wide open.
And the inside of the trap smells like food to insects. So they fly or crawl right into
it, looking for a meal. But if they aren’t careful, they become
the meal instead. On each half of the trap, there are three
tiny hairs. If an insect touches two of those hairs, the trap shuts, and the slender spines
around the edges of the leaves close together tightly,  trapping the insect inside. Then the trap slowly digests its meal, meaning
it breaks its food down into smaller pieces. It’s too bad for that little insect, but
it will provide energy for that plant to live. And Venus Flytraps aren’t the only kind
of carnivorous plant. Some plants, called sundews, attract bugs
with colorful red and green leaves that are covered with a sweet, sticky “dew” that
sparkles in the sunlight. The thing is, this dew acts like a kind of
glue. Any bug that lands on its leaves looking for
a meal will get stuck. And soon the plant just starts digesting it, soaking up nutrients
from the bug’s body right through the leaves. Now, some other carnivorous plants can consume
even bigger prey. Pitcher plants, for example, have big, brightly
colored leaves, curled up into the shape of a tube. At the bottom of the tube sits a little pool
of sweet liquid called nectar. Once again, lots of different creatures are drawn to its
tasty smell. They creep, crawl, jump, or fly to the edge
of the tube to see what’s in there to eat. But the top is really slippery, and there
are stiff hairs all along the inside of the tube pointing down -- so once a creature starts
to fall in, they can’t get out. This clever kind of trap has allowed pitcher
plants to catch not just bugs,  but also make meals of small frogs and even mice! And finally, there are some meat-eating plants
that don’t even live on land. Bladderworts, for example, live and catch
their prey in water. These plants have tiny containers on their
stems called bladders that float underwater. Each bladder has an opening with a tiny flap
on it, that can open and close, like a hidden trapdoor. When insects, like water fleas, trigger tiny
hairs near the trapdoor, the door swings open, and sucks the little creature in. So now you know -- certain plants sometimes
eat animals. Like I said, it’s nice to have variety in
your diet! Thanks for watching SciShow Kids. Till next
time! [music]

**Transcript**:
[music] We all know that we have to eat different
kinds of food to get the nutrition that we need. So eating plants is a great idea if you want
to be healthy. That’s why I like to eat things like carrots, and spinach and tomatoes. I like to eat plants, but what if plants...
tried to eat animals? Well, there are actually a few kinds of plants
that are carnivorous, meaning they eat meat. Now when I say meat, I’m not talking about
chicken nuggets or hamburgers. I’m talking about really small animals,
like insects, spiders, and frogs. Creatures like these have to be extra careful
around meat-eating plants! Probably the most famous carnivorous plant
is known as the Venus Flytrap. Venus Flytraps have leaves at the tops of
their stems that kind of look like tiny, toothy mouths. They’re not really mouths, but they serve
the same purpose: to eat flies, and other insects. Usually, the trap’s leaves are wide open.
And the inside of the trap smells like food to insects. So they fly or crawl right into
it, looking for a meal. But if they aren’t careful, they become
the meal instead. On each half of the trap, there are three
tiny hairs. If an insect touches two of those hairs, the trap shuts, and the slender spines
around the edges of the leaves close together tightly,  trapping the insect inside. Then the trap slowly digests its meal, meaning
it breaks its food down into smaller pieces. It’s too bad for that little insect, but
it will provide energy for that plant to live. And Venus Flytraps aren’t the only kind
of carnivorous plant. Some plants, called sundews, attract bugs
with colorful red and green leaves that are covered with a sweet, sticky “dew” that
sparkles in the sunlight. The thing is, this dew acts like a kind of
glue. Any bug that lands on its leaves looking for
a meal will get stuck. And soon the plant just starts digesting it, soaking up nutrients
from the bug’s body right through the leaves. Now, some other carnivorous plants can consume
even bigger prey. Pitcher plants, for example, have big, brightly
colored leaves, curled up into the shape of a tube. At the bottom of the tube sits a little pool
of sweet liquid called nectar. Once again, lots of different creatures are drawn to its
tasty smell. They creep, crawl, jump, or fly to the edge
of the tube to see what’s in there to eat. But the top is really slippery, and there
are stiff hairs all along the inside of the tube pointing down -- so once a creature starts
to fall in, they can’t get out. This clever kind of trap has allowed pitcher
plants to catch not just bugs,  but also make meals of small frogs and even mice! And finally, there are some meat-eating plants
that don’t even live on land. Bladderworts, for example, live and catch
their prey in water. These plants have tiny containers on their
stems called bladders that float underwater. Each bladder has an opening with a tiny flap
on it, that can open and close, like a hidden trapdoor. When insects, like water fleas, trigger tiny
hairs near the trapdoor, the door swings open, and sucks the little creature in. So now you know -- certain plants sometimes
eat animals. Like I said, it’s nice to have variety in
your diet! Thanks for watching SciShow Kids. Till next

[INTRO ♪] So you’re in line at the grocery store,
and there’s a parent holding a baby right in front of you. You’re minding your own business, but when
you look up, that baby just won’t stop staring at you
like you’re the most interesting thing on the planet. You might feel like you’ve grown a second
head, or like you have chocolate smeared all over
your mouth, but in reality, that baby just likes looking
at your face. Because there’s a lot to figure out there! From very early in life, babies seem to like
looking at faces, or even just configurations of shapes that
look like faces. They also prefer faces they recognize to ones
they don’t, but they’ll sometimes spend a little more
time looking at strangers because they’re new or different. Faces are important to babies because they’re
basically completely helpless and have to rely on their
caregivers to survive. They need to be able to find and communicate
with the people who feed them and change their diapers, and knowing what they look like is an important
part of that. Even if said communication just involves screaming
at the top of their lungs for a while. Babies are also busy taking in huge amounts
of information to help them understand the world, and faces
can teach them a lot. From our expressions to how our mouths form
words, a lot of our communication as humans happens
through our faces. In those first few months of life, babies
are not only beginning to learn how to recognize their parents or grandparents, but also about all the emotions conveyed by
facial expressions. There’s a lot to learn! So when a baby is staring at you in the grocery
store, her little brain is probably trying to figure
if she knows you and what categories your face fits into, like
if you’re happy or sad. Now, babies might be born ready to learn from
the world around them, but there’s still some question about whether
looking at faces is an innate characteristic— one you’re born with—or if it’s influenced
by experience. And, like with a lot of the age-old, nature
versus nurture debate, it’s a little bit of both. On the nature side, there’s some evidence
that, within hours to days of being born, babies can copy facial expressions they see,
like if you stick out your tongue at them. Not all studies agree with those results,
but it’s possible that there’s an innate ability for finding and mimicking
expressions. Other research has found that within hours
of birth, babies can discriminate between their mother’s
face and a stranger’s, which might mean their brain is ready to recognize
faces without much information. So, some evidence suggests that babies may
be predisposed to look for information from faces right when
they’re born. But other studies have shown that it takes
experience to get really good at it. Either way, all the time babies and their
caregivers spend looking at each other causes rapid improvement in babies’ abilities
to process and recognize faces. Starting around 3 months old, they even begin
to group different kinds of faces— like human versus animals and kids versus
adults. One especially cool study had babies and adults
look at a series of different monkey faces, and also at a bunch of different adult human
faces. They found that 6-month-old babies are actually
better at differentiating between monkey faces than
adults are! But when they’re about 9 months old, that
ability goes away because of what’s called perceptual narrowing, where their perception starts to change based
on their experience. Basically, the baby learns that paying attention
to the differences in human faces is way more important for its life than the
differences in monkey faces, so it should focus more on humans than monkeys. As the brain develops over time, the pathways
used to recognize human faces get more efficient, and the ones
for monkeys get pruned away. But when researchers expose babies to lots
of monkey faces between when they’re 6 and 9 months old, they effectively teach their brains that monkeys
are important to pay attention to, so they keep that ability for a lot longer. Even though babies are born with some skills, experience helps tell them what parts of the
world they should pay attention to, and that shapes how their brain’s perception
and recognition systems develop. So, it’s a little bit of nature and a little
bit of nurture that goes into that cute, big-eyed baby staring
at you. And yeah, in that moment, your face might
just be the most interesting thing on the planet. But don’t rule out the possibility that
you might have a little chocolate on your face, too. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow

like if you stick out your tongue at them. Not all studies agree with those results,
but it’s possible that there’s an innate ability for finding and mimicking
expressions. Other research has found that within hours
of birth, babies can discriminate between their mother’s
face and a stranger’s, which might mean their brain is ready to recognize
faces without much information. So, some evidence suggests that babies may
be predisposed to look for information from faces right when
they’re born. But other studies have shown that it takes
experience to get really good at it. Either way, all the time babies and their
caregivers spend looking at each other causes rapid improvement in babies’ abilities
to process and recognize faces. Starting around 3 months old, they even begin
to group different kinds of faces— like human versus animals and kids versus
adults. One especially cool study had babies and adults
look at a series of different monkey faces, and also at a bunch of different adult human
faces. They found that 6-month-old babies are actually
better at differentiating between monkey faces than
adults are! But when they’re about 9 months old, that
ability goes away because of what’s called perceptual narrowing, where their perception starts to change based
on their experience. Basically, the baby learns that paying attention
to the differences in human faces is way more important for its life than the
differences in monkey faces, so it should focus more on humans than monkeys. As the brain develops over time, the pathways
used to recognize human faces get more efficient, and the ones
for monkeys get pruned away. But when researchers expose babies to lots
of monkey faces between when they’re 6 and 9 months old, they effectively teach their brains that monkeys
are important to pay attention to, so they keep that ability for a lot longer. Even though babies are born with some skills, experience helps tell them what parts of the
world they should pay attention to, and that shapes how their brain’s perception
and recognition systems develop. So, it’s a little bit of nature and a little
bit of nurture that goes into that cute, big-eyed baby staring
at you. And yeah, in that moment, your face might
just be the most interesting thing on the planet. But don’t rule out the possibility that
you might have a little chocolate on your face, too. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow

**Transcript**:
[INTRO ♪] So you’re in line at the grocery store,
and there’s a parent holding a baby right in front of you. You’re minding your own business, but when
you look up, that baby just won’t stop staring at you
like you’re the most interesting thing on the planet. You might feel like you’ve grown a second
head, or like you have chocolate smeared all over
your mouth, but in reality, that baby just likes looking
at your face. Because there’s a lot to figure out there! From very early in life, babies seem to like
looking at faces, or even just configurations of shapes that
look like faces. They also prefer faces they recognize to ones
they don’t, but they’ll sometimes spend a little more
time looking at strangers because they’re new or different. Faces are important to babies because they’re
basically completely helpless and have to rely on their
caregivers to survive. They need to be able to find and communicate
with the people who feed them and change their diapers, and knowing what they look like is an important
part of that. Even if said communication just involves screaming
at the top of their lungs for a while. Babies are also busy taking in huge amounts
of information to help them understand the world, and faces
can teach them a lot. From our expressions to how our mouths form
words, a lot of our communication as humans happens
through our faces. In those first few months of life, babies
are not only beginning to learn how to recognize their parents or grandparents, but also about all the emotions conveyed by
facial expressions. There’s a lot to learn! So when a baby is staring at you in the grocery
store, her little brain is probably trying to figure
if she knows you and what categories your face fits into, like
if you’re happy or sad. Now, babies might be born ready to learn from
the world around them, but there’s still some question about whether
looking at faces is an innate characteristic— one you’re born with—or if it’s influenced
by experience. And, like with a lot of the age-old, nature
versus nurture debate, it’s a little bit of both. On the nature side, there’s some evidence
that, within hours to days of being born, babies can copy facial expressions they see,
like if you stick out your tongue at them. Not all studies agree with those results,
but it’s possible that there’s an innate ability for finding and mimicking
expressions. Other research has found that within hours

face and a stranger’s, which might mean their brain is ready to recognize
faces without much information. So, some evidence suggests that babies may
be predisposed to look for information from faces right when
they’re born. But other studies have shown that it takes
experience to get really good at it. Either way, all the time babies and their
caregivers spend looking at each other causes rapid improvement in babies’ abilities

[Music] you might know of dyslexia as a reading disorder or that one condition that makes letters seem to float around on the page and that's understandable because it does mess with people's ability to read but it's more complex than letters flipping around and floating away years of research suggests that people with dyslexia might struggle with processing letters because they also have trouble processing of all things rhythm people with dyslexia tend to read more slowly than others misspelled words or confuse letters that look similar and the disorder is far from being uncommon most estimates say it affects at least 1 in 10 people but despite its impacts on reading dyslexia may actually be caused at least in part by something more Musical whether you realize it or not language has a whole lot of rhythm whole lotta rhythm a whole lotta rhythm a whole lot of rhythm a whole lotta rhythm just like that and I'm not talking about like beat boxing or slam poetry or whatever I just did I'm talking about everyday speech think about it like this if you say a word like difficult there's a right way to stress and pitch those sounds difficult is right and difficult just it sounds kind of weird this rhythm that's built into language is known as prosody most people have no trouble processing it they do it without even thinking but a study published in 2011 showed that people with dyslexia tend to have a harder time with this they're much less able to tell if a miss stressed word is pronounced right or wrong and if you have trouble parsing the rhythmic stress patterns and words that can make it extra tricky to match letters to the sounds of words in other words if you don't have a good internal representation of what the word is supposed to sound like when you read something there are fewer clues to help you link letters on the page to the meaning of the word scientists believe this might happen because of differences in the way dyslexic brains sample sound according to the theory of temporal sampling as sensory information like speech enters your brain your brain takes snapshots of that information so it doesn't just absorb information continuously it takes a bunch of snapshots at different rates some quicker than others and it uses those snapshots to put together an image or in this case an auditory representation of the signals it's receiving if we stick with the camera metaphor for a sec you can imagine the brain as a camera trying to take a picture of a hummingbird a non dyslexic brain is like a camera with a fast shutter speed it captures a clear moment in time even though the hummingbirds wings are beating really quickly on the other hand a dyslexic brain is more like a camera with a slower shutter speed so instead of capturing the wings clearly it captures a blur in the real world what that means is that sometimes a dyslexic brain doesn't process rhythmic information as fast as it's arriving as a result someone with dyslexia may not lock into rhythms and language as well as someone without dyslexia the difference or at least one of them seems to be in a part of the brain called the arcuate fasciculus which is a kind of connective highway between parts of the brain involved in language and those with dyslexia the arcuate fasciculus is smaller with less white matter to carry information and the fewer connections the harder it becomes to pass information around those language areas along with its role in language the arcuate fasciculus is also really important for music in fact there's some evidence that people with dyslexia could make use of this connection between language and music to improve their reading skills a 2016 study used what's called cognitive musical training or CMT on two groups of children between 8 and 12 years old 12 children had dyslexia and 22 had typical reading skills for 18 hours either spread over three days or six weeks these children practice musical exercises like tapping out rhythms learning about pitch and duration and playing simple melodies before and after their training researchers tested their ability to tell apart similar sounds such as ba and pas as well as pick out examples of incorrect stress in three syllable words the results showed that following CMT training the kids with dyslexia got significantly better at distinguishing sounds from one another as well as picking up on incorrect prosody on top of that a further study by those same authors found that following the six-week training dyslexic kids reading skills improved even without any specific reading training the idea of using this connection between music and language is really exciting but the science isn't settled yet so while studies like this one found strong effects on reading others just haven't so for the moment psychologists need to better understand what exactly might be influencing improvements in reading and whether or not other experiments can get the same results dyslexia is just one of the many variations and how our brains and the world around us but thanks to its complexity it has a lot to show us about how we process things like language and rhythm and use them to

with dyslexia could make use of this connection between language and music to improve their reading skills a 2016 study used what's called cognitive musical training or CMT on two groups of children between 8 and 12 years old 12 children had dyslexia and 22 had typical reading skills for 18 hours either spread over three days or six weeks these children practice musical exercises like tapping out rhythms learning about pitch and duration and playing simple melodies before and after their training researchers tested their ability to tell apart similar sounds such as ba and pas as well as pick out examples of incorrect stress in three syllable words the results showed that following CMT training the kids with dyslexia got significantly better at distinguishing sounds from one another as well as picking up on incorrect prosody on top of that a further study by those same authors found that following the six-week training dyslexic kids reading skills improved even without any specific reading training the idea of using this connection between music and language is really exciting but the science isn't settled yet so while studies like this one found strong effects on reading others just haven't so for the moment psychologists need to better understand what exactly might be influencing improvements in reading and whether or not other experiments can get the same results dyslexia is just one of the many variations and how our brains and the world around us but thanks to its complexity it has a lot to show us about how we process things like language and rhythm and use them to

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine we want to build a new space port at one of four recently settled 
Martian bases, and are holding a vote 
to determine its location. Of the hundred colonists on Mars, 
42 live on West Base, 26 on North Base, 15 on South Base, and 17 on East Base. For our purposes, let’s assume 
that everyone prefers the space port to be as close to their base as possible, 
and will vote accordingly. What is the fairest way 
to conduct that vote? The most straightforward solution 
would be to just let each individual cast a single ballot, and choose 
the location with the most votes. This is known as plurality voting, 
or "first past the post." In this case, West Base wins easily, since it has more residents 
than any other. And yet, most colonists would consider 
this the worst result, given how far it is from everyone else. So is plurality vote 
really the fairest method? What if we tried a system 
like instant runoff voting, which accounts for the full range 
of people’s preferences rather than just their top choices? Here’s how it would work. First, voters rank 
each of the options from 1 to 4, and we compare their top picks. South receives the fewest votes 
for first place, so it’s eliminated. Its 15 votes get allocated 
to those voters’ second choice— East Base— giving it a total of 32. We then compare top preferences 
and cut the last place option again. This time North Base is eliminated. Its residents’ second choice 
would’ve been South Base, but since that’s already gone,
the votes go to their third choice. That gives East 58 votes over West’s 42, 
making it the winner. But this doesn’t seem fair either. Not only did East start out 
in second-to-last place, but a majority ranked it among 
their two least preferred options. Instead of using rankings, we could try 
voting in multiple rounds, with the top two winners 
proceeding to a separate runoff. Normally, this would mean West and North 
winning the first round, and North winning the second. But the residents of East Base realize that while they don’t have 
the votes to win, they can still skew the results 
in their favor. In the first round, they vote 
for South Base instead of their own, successfully keeping North 
from advancing. Thanks to this "tactical voting"
by East Base residents, South wins the second round easily,
despite being the least populated. Can a system be called fair and good 
if it incentivizes lying about your preferences? Maybe what we need to do 
is let voters express a preference in every possible head-to-head matchup. This is known as the Condorcet method. Consider one matchup: 
West versus North. All 100 colonists vote on their preference
between the two. So that's West's 42 versus 
the 58 from North, South, and East, who would all prefer North. Now do the same 
for the other five matchups. The victor will be whichever base 
wins the most times. Here, North wins three 
and South wins two. These are indeed the two 
most central locations, and North has the advantage of not being 
anyone’s least preferred choice. So does that make the Condorcet method 
an ideal voting system in general? Not necessarily. Consider an election 
with three candidates. If voters prefer A over B, and B over C, 
but prefer C over A, this method fails to select a winner. Over the decades, researchers 
and statisticians have come up with dozens of intricate ways 
of conducting and counting votes, and some have even been 
put into practice. But whichever one you choose, it's possible to imagine it delivering 
an unfair result. It turns out that our intuitive concept 
of fairness actually contains a number of assumptions 
that may contradict each other. It doesn’t seem fair for some voters 
to have more influence than others. But nor does it seem fair to simply 
ignore minority preferences, or encourage people to game the system. In fact, mathematical proofs 
have shown that for any election with more than two options, it’s impossible to design a voting system 
that doesn’t violate at least some theoretically
desirable criteria. So while we often think of democracy 
as a simple matter of counting votes, it’s also worth considering who benefits
from the different ways of counting them.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why is it not an ideal outcome for West base to win the vote?
Options: A. It’s farthest away from all the others, B. It has the least residents, C. It’s the least hospitable environment

**Transcript**:
Imagine we want to build a new space port at one of four recently settled 
Martian bases, and are holding a vote 
to determine its location. Of the hundred colonists on Mars, 
42 live on West Base, 26 on North Base, 15 on South Base, and 17 on East Base. For our purposes, let’s assume 
that everyone prefers the space port to be as close to their base as possible, 
and will vote accordingly. What is the fairest way 
to conduct that vote? The most straightforward solution 
would be to just let each individual cast a single ballot, and choose 
the location with the most votes. This is known as plurality voting, 
or "first past the post." In this case, West Base wins easily, since it has more residents 
than any other. And yet, most colonists would consider 
this the worst result, given how far it is from everyone else. So is plurality vote 
really the fairest method? What if we tried a system 
like instant runoff voting, which accounts for the full range 
of people’s preferences rather than just their top choices? Here’s how it would work. First, voters rank 
each of the options from 1 to 4, and we compare their top picks. South receives the fewest votes 
for first place, so it’s eliminated. Its 15 votes get allocated 
to those voters’ second choice— East Base— giving it a total of 32. We then compare top preferences 
and cut the last place option again. This time North Base is eliminated. Its residents’ second choice 
would’ve been South Base, but since that’s already gone,
the votes go to their third choice. That gives East 58 votes over West’s 42, 
making it the winner. But this doesn’t seem fair either. Not only did East start out 
in second-to-last place, but a majority ranked it among 
their two least preferred options. Instead of using rankings, we could try 
voting in multiple rounds, with the top two winners 
proceeding to a separate runoff. Normally, this would mean West and North 
winning the first round, and North winning the second. But the residents of East Base realize that while they don’t have 
the votes to win, they can still skew the results 
in their favor. In the first round, they vote 
for South Base instead of their own, successfully keeping North 
from advancing. Thanks to this "tactical voting"
by East Base residents, South wins the second round easily,
despite being the least populated. Can a system be called fair and good 
if it incentivizes lying about your preferences? Maybe what we need to do 
is let voters express a preference in every possible head-to-head matchup. This is known as the Condorcet method. Consider one matchup: 
West versus North. All 100 colonists vote on their preference
between the two. So that's West's 42 versus 
the 58 from North, South, and East, who would all prefer North. Now do the same 
for the other five matchups. The victor will be whichever base 
wins the most times. Here, North wins three 
and South wins two. These are indeed the two 
most central locations, and North has the advantage of not being 
anyone’s least preferred choice. So does that make the Condorcet method 
an ideal voting system in general? Not necessarily. Consider an election 
with three candidates. If voters prefer A over B, and B over C, 
but prefer C over A, this method fails to select a winner. Over the decades, researchers 
and statisticians have come up with dozens of intricate ways 
of conducting and counting votes, and some have even been 
put into practice. But whichever one you choose, it's possible to imagine it delivering 
an unfair result. It turns out that our intuitive concept 
of fairness actually contains a number of assumptions 
that may contradict each other. It doesn’t seem fair for some voters 
to have more influence than others. But nor does it seem fair to simply 
ignore minority preferences, or encourage people to game the system. In fact, mathematical proofs 
have shown that for any election with more than two options, it’s impossible to design a voting system 
that doesn’t violate at least some theoretically
desirable criteria. So while we often think of democracy 
as a simple matter of counting votes, it’s also worth considering who benefits
from the different ways of counting them.

It’s summer! It’s time for Squeaks and I to get out our
swimsuits, our /cool/ shades, and head outside for some fun in the sun! But I need to make some smart choices before
we go outside. I need to wear sunscreen, because I don’t
want to end up getting a sunburn! Squeaks doesn’t need to worry about sunburns,
since he’s a robot. But we humans can get a sunburn when we stay
out in the sun too long and don’t protect our skin. Even though the rays of the sun feel nice
and warm, and are important for all kinds of life on the Earth, some of the rays from
the sun’s light can harm our skin. Now, our skin /does/ have something in it
that helps to protect it from these harmful rays. But sometimes, like when you’re outside
all day, that’s not enough. If too many of these rays reach your skin,
your skin can become damaged, or hurt. When skin gets damaged, the body does its
best to fix it as soon as possible. It sends more blood to the damaged area, which
causes the skin there to get pink or red, and feel warm when you touch it. The damaged area can feel /really/ sore, and
some of the skin can also peel off. These are all signs of sunburn. There are lots of things that can affect whether
you get a sunburn or not. People with lighter skin sunburn more easily,
and spending more time outside can also lead to more of a sunburn. But anyone can get a sunburn. Luckily, there are plenty of different things
we can do to keep from getting one. For example, wearing clothes that cover our
skin and completely block the sun’s light can keep those harmful rays from getting to
the skin on our bodies. And wearing a hat can keep those rays from
causing a sunburn on our heads. We can also try to spend less time in the
sun when its rays are brightest—that’s usually between ten in the morning and four
in the afternoon. But one of the easiest things we can do is
to wear sunscreen. Sunscreen can be a lotion, a cream, or a spray. But no matter what kind of sunscreen you use,
it keeps some of the sun’s rays from getting to your skin, and can help stop a sunburn. Most sunscreens work by either soaking up
those harmful rays, kind of like a sponge, or by reflecting them, kind of like a mirror. Most experts say that you should put sunscreen
at least ten minutes before you go outside. And you should put on lots of it! It’s a good idea to get some help putting
on sunscreen, especially in places that are kind of hard to reach, like all over your
back. You might also want to get help putting it
on other places — especially places you might not think about, like your ears, the
backs of your legs, and the back of your neck! And once you get your sunscreen on, you should
make sure you keep it on! It’s a great idea to take a break every
few hours and to put on some more sunscreen, especially if you’re running around and
getting sweaty, or you’re swimming at the pool or the beach. So, enjoy your time in sun this summer … but
don’t forget to wear your sunscreen! Thanks for joining us for this episode of

**Transcript**:
It’s summer! It’s time for Squeaks and I to get out our
swimsuits, our /cool/ shades, and head outside for some fun in the sun! But I need to make some smart choices before
we go outside. I need to wear sunscreen, because I don’t
want to end up getting a sunburn! Squeaks doesn’t need to worry about sunburns,
since he’s a robot. But we humans can get a sunburn when we stay
out in the sun too long and don’t protect our skin. Even though the rays of the sun feel nice
and warm, and are important for all kinds of life on the Earth, some of the rays from
the sun’s light can harm our skin. Now, our skin /does/ have something in it
that helps to protect it from these harmful rays. But sometimes, like when you’re outside
all day, that’s not enough. If too many of these rays reach your skin,
your skin can become damaged, or hurt. When skin gets damaged, the body does its
best to fix it as soon as possible. It sends more blood to the damaged area, which
causes the skin there to get pink or red, and feel warm when you touch it. The damaged area can feel /really/ sore, and
some of the skin can also peel off. These are all signs of sunburn. There are lots of things that can affect whether
you get a sunburn or not. People with lighter skin sunburn more easily,
and spending more time outside can also lead to more of a sunburn. But anyone can get a sunburn. Luckily, there are plenty of different things

One of my favorite things to do on this channel
is to get you to look at the world you know in a different way, to take something you
thought was ordinary, and show you why it’s amazing. Today I’m here in Alaska, and you’re never
gonna look at beavers the same way again. They chew down trees, and they build dams. But what most people don’t know is without
beavers, North America–and much of the world–would be totally different than it is today. Beavers are one of the ultimate keystone species—a
plant or animal so important to an ecosystem, that without it, the whole thing would basically
break. Their dams create habitats for dozens of species,
filter and purify water, and enrich the soil by trapping sediment and nutrients. Beaver ponds reshape landscapes on such an
enormous scale it impacts all other wildlife and vegetation in the area. Earth is home to two beaver species today:
one in Europe, and these here in North America. They’re the second largest rodents living
today, and like most rodents they have big front teeth that never stop growing. Beaver teeth are actually reinforced with
iron, and with their enormous jaw muscles they use those teeth to slice through bark
and chop down trees. Besides being carpenters, they even play the
part of plumbers. When a beaver hears the sound of running water,
it drives them nuts, they know the dam has sprung a leak and they have an uncontrollable
instinct to go patch it up. Beavers are ecosystem engineers second only
to humans, and they stay pretty DAM busy keeping this pond nice and full. Beavers’ urge to build can sometimes cause
headaches, but NO beavers can be an even BIGGER problem. Before European colonists arrived, there were
as many as 400 million beavers in the US and Canada! North America was covered with tens of millions
of beaver dams. Imagine between 5 and 30 beavers on every
kilometer of stream or river on the whole continent! That’s a lotta beavers. But over a few hundred years they were almost
hunted to extinction. Beavers were big business. They were trapped for fur, mostly to make
hats, but also for sacs on their butts full of castoreum—a pungent substance used in
perfumes. The British Hudson’s Bay Company even tried
to eradicate beavers from the Pacific Northwestv, figuring with no beavers left to hunt, the
United States would stop its westward expansion. Wherever pioneers went, they killed every
beaver they could find, despite the fact that beavers were responsible for most of the farmland
in the West. Populations dwindled from millions to the
low thousands. Without beaver dams, huge areas of land are
left with less water. hundreds of species (like fish, birds, insects,
and amphibians) are left without a habitat. So… beaver dams are great for other species,
but what’s in it for the beavers? Why do they build them? For beavers the pond created by their dams
is a safe place to build a home, called a lodge, where they raise their young and keep
away from predators. Beavers are pretty awkward on land, but they
are safe and happy in the water. The entrance to a beaver lodge is underwater,
so beavers can safely scoot in and out. Since they don’t hibernate, this lets them
access underwater food stores even when their ponds are frozen over. Beavers’ favorite foods are the leaves and
soft outer bark of trees, but like most mammals, they don’t digest wood very well, so they
eat their excrement to get the most out of a meal… until it eventually comes out looking
like sawdust. A crew of beavers spotted in a pond is usually
a family. Beaver couples often mate for life and beaver
kits live with their parents for a couple years while they practice their engineering
skills. The oldest dams ever discovered are 100,000
years old telling us beavers or their close relatives have been altering our landscapes
even before we moved in. And for most of the thousands of years we’ve
lived together, we’ve lived in harmony. Now that we’ve realized how important they
are, beaver populations are starting to recover. More beavers means more homes for
fish and birds, fresher water, and less damage from flooding and forest fires. Beavers feature prominently in the oral histories
of North America’s First Nations people, even playing a part in many creation myths,

today, and like most rodents they have big front teeth that never stop growing. Beaver teeth are actually reinforced with
iron, and with their enormous jaw muscles they use those teeth to slice through bark
and chop down trees. Besides being carpenters, they even play the
part of plumbers. When a beaver hears the sound of running water,
it drives them nuts, they know the dam has sprung a leak and they have an uncontrollable
instinct to go patch it up. Beavers are ecosystem engineers second only
to humans, and they stay pretty DAM busy keeping this pond nice and full. Beavers’ urge to build can sometimes cause
headaches, but NO beavers can be an even BIGGER problem. Before European colonists arrived, there were
as many as 400 million beavers in the US and Canada! North America was covered with tens of millions
of beaver dams. Imagine between 5 and 30 beavers on every
kilometer of stream or river on the whole continent! That’s a lotta beavers. But over a few hundred years they were almost
hunted to extinction. Beavers were big business. They were trapped for fur, mostly to make
hats, but also for sacs on their butts full of castoreum—a pungent substance used in
perfumes. The British Hudson’s Bay Company even tried
to eradicate beavers from the Pacific Northwestv, figuring with no beavers left to hunt, the
United States would stop its westward expansion. Wherever pioneers went, they killed every
beaver they could find, despite the fact that beavers were responsible for most of the farmland
in the West. Populations dwindled from millions to the
low thousands. Without beaver dams, huge areas of land are
left with less water. hundreds of species (like fish, birds, insects,
and amphibians) are left without a habitat. So… beaver dams are great for other species,
but what’s in it for the beavers? Why do they build them? For beavers the pond created by their dams
is a safe place to build a home, called a lodge, where they raise their young and keep
away from predators. Beavers are pretty awkward on land, but they
are safe and happy in the water. The entrance to a beaver lodge is underwater,
so beavers can safely scoot in and out. Since they don’t hibernate, this lets them
access underwater food stores even when their ponds are frozen over. Beavers’ favorite foods are the leaves and
soft outer bark of trees, but like most mammals, they don’t digest wood very well, so they
eat their excrement to get the most out of a meal… until it eventually comes out looking
like sawdust. A crew of beavers spotted in a pond is usually
a family. Beaver couples often mate for life and beaver
kits live with their parents for a couple years while they practice their engineering
skills. The oldest dams ever discovered are 100,000
years old telling us beavers or their close relatives have been altering our landscapes
even before we moved in. And for most of the thousands of years we’ve
lived together, we’ve lived in harmony. Now that we’ve realized how important they
are, beaver populations are starting to recover. More beavers means more homes for
fish and birds, fresher water, and less damage from flooding and forest fires. Beavers feature prominently in the oral histories
of North America’s First Nations people, even playing a part in many creation myths,
which is neat, because beavers really have created much of the landscape we live in,
showing us how old and important our relationship is with the smartest thing in fur pants. Stay curious! Beavers are big as rodents go today, but during
the Pleistocene, Earth was home to a beaver called Castoroides the size of a black bear. Too bad they went extinct.

**Transcript**:
In 1879, when James Hingsley returned to Australia
from Indonesia he brought back tales of an orchid that engulfed butterflies in its petals
and devoured them alive. A carnivorous plant more beautiful and ravenous
than any other. But that fantastical creature was no plant
– it was a predator... dressed to kill. [OPEN] Blending in is a great way to stay alive,
but it can be just as useful for the hunter as the hunted. That butterfly-eating beast from Indonesia? That isn’t an orchid at all. It’s an orchid mantis, an insect native
to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. These beautiful bugs exhibit a behavior called
aggressive mimicry: that’s using a disguise not to hide, but to stand out. It’s counterintuitive, but you’ve probably
come across one such creature before. Nope, not waldo. Like a snapping turtle’s wriggly worm-tongue,
or an Angler fish’s luminous bait, some animals use the promise of food to conceal
more deadly intentions. Some parasites even mimic their hosts’ prey
to get swallowed. Other mimics rely on smellovision to do the
trick. One spider attracts prey by sending out a
chemical signal that female moths usually use to attract mates. Like the plants they’re named after, these
mantises use their looks to flirt. Orchids display beautiful patterns to attract
their favorite pollinators: bees and flies. And with their petaled legs wrapped in pinks
and yellows, orchid mantises can disappear amongst those forests of flowers. They wear such a good disguise, that every
so often an insect *looking* for dinner *becomes* dinner. At least, that’s what scientists thought…
until one noticed something weird: orchid mantises don’t actually need any flowers
around for their disguises to work. They attract prey even *better* than the real
thing. To understand why, we have to think – and
see – like a flying insect. That means looking beyond our human senses. It would be hard for you or I to pluck an
orchid mantis from a flowery background. Our visual system picks up on the shapes,
edges and finer details of the mantis’s disguise. Our brains see petals, and think “flower”. On the other hand, bees, flies – even beetles
and butterflies see the floral fatales completely differently. Pollinator eyes and brains don’t pick up
on the fine details, but the bigger picture comes in loud and clear. To these prey animals, an orchid mantis doesn’t
just look like a flower, it looks bigger and brighter than a flower – and there lies
the trick. Some flowering plants “get it on” with
anything willing to stop by, but orchids are exclusive with their pollinators. One type only attracts male bees from a single
species. If an orchid mantis’ disguise was too particular,
it would limit the number of animals it might fool. Instead, by looking a little like every flower,
they can attract even more prey. These animal liars *fool* our brains too,
but orchid mantises didn’t *evolve* to fool human brains. In fact, the way they deceive us falls into
a totally different camouflage category: cryptic mimicry. Like their close kin, orchid mantises will
even rock back and forth like a flower swaying in the breeze. We don’t know for sure, but scientists think
looking like an orchid could also help conceal them from predators like birds, lizards, and
monkeys in the same way. Pinning down how these predators and parasites
evolved their deadly strategies of disguise has been almost impossible until recently. And we’re still figuring them out. Some disguises are so good, their true purpose
can be hard to see. Stay curious.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is "aggressive mimicry"?
Options: A. Using a disguise to hide., B. Using a disguise to stand out., C. Having camouflage to avoid predators., D. Acting like another object to stay safe.
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is aggressive mimicry in animals?
Options: A. A behavior where an animal uses a disguise to hide from predators, B. A behavior where an animal uses a disguise to attract prey, C. A behavior where an animal uses a disguise to blend in with its environment, D. A behavior where an animal uses a disguise to communicate with other animals

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1879, when James Hingsley returned to Australia
from Indonesia he brought back tales of an orchid that engulfed butterflies in its petals
and devoured them alive. A carnivorous plant more beautiful and ravenous
than any other. But that fantastical creature was no plant
– it was a predator... dressed to kill. [OPEN] Blending in is a great way to stay alive,
but it can be just as useful for the hunter as the hunted. That butterfly-eating beast from Indonesia? That isn’t an orchid at all. It’s an orchid mantis, an insect native
to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. These beautiful bugs exhibit a behavior called
aggressive mimicry: that’s using a disguise not to hide, but to stand out. It’s counterintuitive, but you’ve probably
come across one such creature before. Nope, not waldo. Like a snapping turtle’s wriggly worm-tongue,
or an Angler fish’s luminous bait, some animals use the promise of food to conceal
more deadly intentions. Some parasites even mimic their hosts’ prey
to get swallowed. Other mimics rely on smellovision to do the
trick. One spider attracts prey by sending out a
chemical signal that female moths usually use to attract mates. Like the plants they’re named after, these
mantises use their looks to flirt. Orchids display beautiful patterns to attract
their favorite pollinators: bees and flies. And with their petaled legs wrapped in pinks
and yellows, orchid mantises can disappear amongst those forests of flowers. They wear such a good disguise, that every
so often an insect *looking* for dinner *becomes* dinner. At least, that’s what scientists thought…
until one noticed something weird: orchid mantises don’t actually need any flowers
around for their disguises to work. They attract prey even *better* than the real
thing. To understand why, we have to think – and
see – like a flying insect. That means looking beyond our human senses. It would be hard for you or I to pluck an
orchid mantis from a flowery background. Our visual system picks up on the shapes,
edges and finer details of the mantis’s disguise. Our brains see petals, and think “flower”. On the other hand, bees, flies – even beetles
and butterflies see the floral fatales completely differently. Pollinator eyes and brains don’t pick up
on the fine details, but the bigger picture comes in loud and clear. To these prey animals, an orchid mantis doesn’t
just look like a flower, it looks bigger and brighter than a flower – and there lies
the trick. Some flowering plants “get it on” with
anything willing to stop by, but orchids are exclusive with their pollinators. One type only attracts male bees from a single
species. If an orchid mantis’ disguise was too particular,
it would limit the number of animals it might fool. Instead, by looking a little like every flower,
they can attract even more prey. These animal liars *fool* our brains too,
but orchid mantises didn’t *evolve* to fool human brains. In fact, the way they deceive us falls into
a totally different camouflage category: cryptic mimicry. Like their close kin, orchid mantises will
even rock back and forth like a flower swaying in the breeze. We don’t know for sure, but scientists think
looking like an orchid could also help conceal them from predators like birds, lizards, and
monkeys in the same way. Pinning down how these predators and parasites
evolved their deadly strategies of disguise has been almost impossible until recently. And we’re still figuring them out. Some disguises are so good, their true purpose
can be hard to see. Stay curious.

**Transcript**:
[ INTRO ] I’m so glad you’re still having fun with
that balloon, Squeaks! [Squeaks thanks her for saving it] Oh right! We did almost lose it earlier today. We were in the pizza store getting some lunch, and the balloon slipped out of Squeaks’
paw! It went up to the ceiling, but the string
was hanging down far enough that I could grab it back. Then we tied it to a water bottle from my
backpack so it wouldn’t get away again. It’s a good thing it didn’t escape while
we were outside! [Squeaks asks what would have happened] Well, a couple of different things can happen
to a balloon that escapes into the sky — the regular type of balloon, I mean, that’s
made out of the stretchy rubber stuff. First, the balloon starts to rise higher and
higher into the air. That’s because balloons aren’t filled
with regular air, like the kind we breathe. They’re filled with something called helium,
and it makes the balloon lighter for its size than the air around it. So it starts to float on the air, just like
certain things float on water. If you try to push a plastic spoon to the
bottom of a bowl of water, the spoon will just float to the top again. If someone lets go of a helium balloon outside,
it starts to rise through the air like the spoon at the bottom of the bowl rises through
the water. But unlike the small amount of water in the
bowl, there’s lots of air all around us, and it stretches up really high in the sky. So the balloon keeps floating higher and higher
and higher. And as it goes higher, the air around it starts
to change. The higher into the sky you go, the less air
there is. There’s still some air, but it becomes more
spread out. And as the air outside the balloon spreads
out, the helium inside the balloon starts to spread out, too, pushing out on the inside
of the balloon. What happens next depends on the strength
of the stuff the balloon is made of. If the balloon isn’t very strong, the helium
pushing on it will pop the balloon before it gets too high up. Then the pieces just fall back down to the
ground. That’s why it’s usually not a good idea
to send balloons into the sky on purpose. When they come back down in those big pieces, they can hurt animals that think they’re
food and try to swallow them. But if the balloon is stronger, something
different will happen. It will keep floating higher and higher up
into the air — sometimes even as high as an airplane! But the air very high up in the sky isn’t
just more spread out — it’s also much colder. When you’re as high up as airplanes go,
it’s freeeeezing. And when rubber gets cold, it becomes stiffer
and less stretchy. So eventually, with the cold combined with
the helium pushing on it from the inside, the balloon can actually /shatter/, breaking
into super tiny little pieces. Those also fall back down to the ground, but
since they’re so small you probably wouldn’t be able to see them. Whether it pops or shatters, the balloon always
does two things: it goes up very high, as far as it can go! And then it comes back down. That’s actually what happened to your balloon
too, Squeaks! Except, since we were inside, it could only go as
high as the ceiling, and then we were able to pull it back down. Have you ever lost a balloon? What do you think happened to it? Ask a grownup to help you leave a comment
below, or send us your questions through our website at patreon.com/scishowkids. We’ll see you next time here at the Fort! [ OUTRO ]

bottom of a bowl of water, the spoon will just float to the top again. If someone lets go of a helium balloon outside,
it starts to rise through the air like the spoon at the bottom of the bowl rises through
the water. But unlike the small amount of water in the
bowl, there’s lots of air all around us, and it stretches up really high in the sky. So the balloon keeps floating higher and higher
and higher. And as it goes higher, the air around it starts
to change. The higher into the sky you go, the less air
there is. There’s still some air, but it becomes more
spread out. And as the air outside the balloon spreads
out, the helium inside the balloon starts to spread out, too, pushing out on the inside
of the balloon. What happens next depends on the strength
of the stuff the balloon is made of. If the balloon isn’t very strong, the helium
pushing on it will pop the balloon before it gets too high up. Then the pieces just fall back down to the
ground. That’s why it’s usually not a good idea
to send balloons into the sky on purpose. When they come back down in those big pieces, they can hurt animals that think they’re
food and try to swallow them. But if the balloon is stronger, something
different will happen. It will keep floating higher and higher up
into the air — sometimes even as high as an airplane! But the air very high up in the sky isn’t
just more spread out — it’s also much colder. When you’re as high up as airplanes go,
it’s freeeeezing. And when rubber gets cold, it becomes stiffer
and less stretchy. So eventually, with the cold combined with
the helium pushing on it from the inside, the balloon can actually /shatter/, breaking
into super tiny little pieces. Those also fall back down to the ground, but
since they’re so small you probably wouldn’t be able to see them. Whether it pops or shatters, the balloon always
does two things: it goes up very high, as far as it can go! And then it comes back down. That’s actually what happened to your balloon
too, Squeaks! Except, since we were inside, it could only go as
high as the ceiling, and then we were able to pull it back down. Have you ever lost a balloon? What do you think happened to it? Ask a grownup to help you leave a comment

**Transcript**:
♪ You’re right, Squeaks; this one is a classic. But did you know that the best part of cartoons
takes place inside your brain? Cartoons like these are made of a bunch of
drawings. When you show those drawings one after another,
super fast, they look like they’re really moving! That’s called an animation. But they’re not really alive, or moving
around — it’s an illusion, a little trick that you can play on your brain. And today Squeaks and I are going to make
our very own version of this trick, called a zoetrope. If we spin all these drawings together really
fast, they just look like a blur. That’s why our zoetrope is going to have
slits, which are little holes. We’ll see each drawing through the slit,
and then see a black space after each one. It will be like we’re seeing each drawing
on its own, but super duper fast. And then when we spin the zoetrope, our brains
will stop noticing the black space and connect the drawings together. The faster the zoetrope spins, the smoother
the animation will be! You can make your own zoetrope along with
us! All you need is: some black construction paper, some white
construction paper, scissors, tape, a ruler, two pencils, a round piece of cardboard or a paper plate,
about 25 centimeters, or 10 inches across, and a grownup to help, because we’ll be
doing some measuring and cutting. For our base, we cut out this round piece
of cardboard, although you can also use a paper plate. We’ll make a small hole in the middle, just
big enough to push one of the pencils through and have the eraser catch on the top. But we won’t put the pencil in yet. Next, we need to make the walls of the zoetrope. For that, we’ll use the black and white
paper. First, we’ll cut two pieces of the black
paper in half, the long way, so we have four long strips. Then we’ll take three of the strips and
tape them together. Next, we’ll wrap them around the outside
of the cardboard bas. We might need to trim a little off the end
to make sure it fits exactly. This is where we’ll put the slits, to look
through and see the animation! We’ll cut 13 slits, each about 3 millimeters,
or an eighth of an inch wide, into the top half of the black strip. We’ll try to make them evenly spaced, about
4 centimeters, or one and a half inches, apart. Just like we did with the black paper, we’ll
cut a piece of white paper in half so we have two long strips. We’re going to take those two, and cut them
in half. That gives us four long strips of paper. We’re going to take three of them, and tape
them all together. Our white strip is now half as tall as our
black strip… and we’re going to cut it so it’s the same length. The white strip of paper will become the rectangles
we use for each drawing. To make those rectangles, we’ll use the
ruler and one of the pencils to measure the strips into 13 rectangles that are each about
4 centimeters, or one and a half inches, across. Now it’s time to draw! Our animation is going to be cyclical, which
means that as soon as it’s done, it’s going to start over again from the beginning. So it’s good to have an animation that ends
right back where it started – like a plane taking off and coming back down, or a person
taking off her hat and putting it back on. We’re going to draw our friend Dino flapping
his wings! Each of your frames should look a lot like
the last one, with tiny changes from one to the next. See how his wings move up and down just a
tiny bit each rectangle? That will help the animation look smoother! Once our drawings are done, we’ll tape them
to the bottom half of the black paper , with each rectangle right below one of the slits. Now we just need to tape the paper around
the base, with the drawings on the inside. Now all we need is to make it spin! So we just stick this pencil through the hole
we made in the base earlier, so the eraser catches on the frame and the pencil doesn’t
fall all the way through. Nice! You could also use chopsticks for this, or
glue the hole in your base to a marble, so that it can spin on a table. Or, with some help from a grown-up, you might
be able to use a record player or a spinning cake platform! And now … we spin. Oh cool! Check it out! If the drawings move fast enough, two illusions
happen to make them look like an animation. In between each frame, there’s a blank spot,
where there’s nothing to see. But when the drawings come quickly enough,
one after the next, your brain stops noticing the blank spaces in between. That’s the first illusion — the effect
of one frame on your eye lasts until the next one comes up. All your brain notices is the drawings. The second illusion is when your brain sees
all those separate drawings and thinks that the pictures are moving! It fills in the blanks in between the frames
for you, and turns them into something that makes sense, like Dino flying! So you can just see the animation – and
enjoy the cartoon. Squeaks, we make an awesome animation team! Did you make a zoetrope too? What would you want to make a cartoon about? We’d love to hear about it! Just ask a grown-up to help you go to patreon.com/scishowkids

**Transcript**:
♪ You’re right, Squeaks; this one is a classic. But did you know that the best part of cartoons
takes place inside your brain? Cartoons like these are made of a bunch of
drawings. When you show those drawings one after another,
super fast, they look like they’re really moving! That’s called an animation. But they’re not really alive, or moving
around — it’s an illusion, a little trick that you can play on your brain. And today Squeaks and I are going to make
our very own version of this trick, called a zoetrope. If we spin all these drawings together really
fast, they just look like a blur. That’s why our zoetrope is going to have
slits, which are little holes. We’ll see each drawing through the slit,
and then see a black space after each one. It will be like we’re seeing each drawing
on its own, but super duper fast. And then when we spin the zoetrope, our brains
will stop noticing the black space and connect the drawings together. The faster the zoetrope spins, the smoother
the animation will be! You can make your own zoetrope along with
us! All you need is: some black construction paper, some white
construction paper, scissors, tape, a ruler, two pencils, a round piece of cardboard or a paper plate,
about 25 centimeters, or 10 inches across, and a grownup to help, because we’ll be
doing some measuring and cutting. For our base, we cut out this round piece
of cardboard, although you can also use a paper plate. We’ll make a small hole in the middle, just
big enough to push one of the pencils through and have the eraser catch on the top. But we won’t put the pencil in yet. Next, we need to make the walls of the zoetrope. For that, we’ll use the black and white
paper. First, we’ll cut two pieces of the black
paper in half, the long way, so we have four long strips. Then we’ll take three of the strips and
tape them together. Next, we’ll wrap them around the outside
of the cardboard bas. We might need to trim a little off the end
to make sure it fits exactly. This is where we’ll put the slits, to look
through and see the animation! We’ll cut 13 slits, each about 3 millimeters,
or an eighth of an inch wide, into the top half of the black strip. We’ll try to make them evenly spaced, about
4 centimeters, or one and a half inches, apart. Just like we did with the black paper, we’ll
cut a piece of white paper in half so we have two long strips. We’re going to take those two, and cut them
in half. That gives us four long strips of paper. We’re going to take three of them, and tape
them all together. Our white strip is now half as tall as our
black strip… and we’re going to cut it so it’s the same length. The white strip of paper will become the rectangles
we use for each drawing. To make those rectangles, we’ll use the
ruler and one of the pencils to measure the strips into 13 rectangles that are each about
4 centimeters, or one and a half inches, across. Now it’s time to draw! Our animation is going to be cyclical, which
means that as soon as it’s done, it’s going to start over again from the beginning. So it’s good to have an animation that ends
right back where it started – like a plane taking off and coming back down, or a person
taking off her hat and putting it back on. We’re going to draw our friend Dino flapping
his wings! Each of your frames should look a lot like
the last one, with tiny changes from one to the next. See how his wings move up and down just a
tiny bit each rectangle? That will help the animation look smoother! Once our drawings are done, we’ll tape them
to the bottom half of the black paper , with each rectangle right below one of the slits. Now we just need to tape the paper around
the base, with the drawings on the inside. Now all we need is to make it spin! So we just stick this pencil through the hole
we made in the base earlier, so the eraser catches on the frame and the pencil doesn’t
fall all the way through. Nice! You could also use chopsticks for this, or
glue the hole in your base to a marble, so that it can spin on a table. Or, with some help from a grown-up, you might
be able to use a record player or a spinning cake platform! And now … we spin. Oh cool! Check it out! If the drawings move fast enough, two illusions
happen to make them look like an animation. In between each frame, there’s a blank spot,
where there’s nothing to see. But when the drawings come quickly enough,
one after the next, your brain stops noticing the blank spaces in between. That’s the first illusion — the effect
of one frame on your eye lasts until the next one comes up. All your brain notices is the drawings. The second illusion is when your brain sees
all those separate drawings and thinks that the pictures are moving! It fills in the blanks in between the frames
for you, and turns them into something that makes sense, like Dino flying! So you can just see the animation – and
enjoy the cartoon. Squeaks, we make an awesome animation team! Did you make a zoetrope too? What would you want to make a cartoon about? We’d love to hear about it! Just ask a grown-up to help you go to patreon.com/scishowkids
and send us a message. We’ll see you next time, here at the Fort! ♪
