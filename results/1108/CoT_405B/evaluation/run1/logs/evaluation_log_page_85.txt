To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Our bodies need lots of energy to keep us
going throughout the day. And do you know where we get that energy? That’s right…from the food we eat! And all kinds of different people enjoy different
kinds of food. But whether your favorite meal includes noodles
or nectarines, tortillas or tofu, most types of food have some of what our bodies need
to stay healthy. You might already know that we can put different
kinds of food into different groups. We call these, you guessed it, food groups! But let’s check out each group, and see
what kind of food belongs where! Let’s start with the fruit group. You gotta love sweet, delicious fruit! This group includes things like apples and
pears, oranges and strawberries. Fresh fruit is the best for you, but fruit
that’s canned or frozen counts, too. After all, many fruits are hard to find in
the winter, and some fruits only grow in certain parts of the world. But don’t forget about fruit that’s been
dried! Raisins are just dried grapes! And prunes are dried-up plums! And even juice is part of the fruit group,
but only if it’s all fruit juice and doesn’t have added sugar. Next comes the grain group. Grains are plants, like oats, wheat, and barley. If a food is made from one of these plants,
or any other grain plant, it belongs here. That means things made of flour, like bread
and noodles, breakfast foods like oatmeal and cereal, and even rice, are all part of
this group. Next up, the vegetable group. I bet you already figured out what goes here! Vegetables come from plants, too -- but unlike
grains, they’re either the roots, stems, or leaves of certain plants that we can eat! Carrots, for example, are the sweet orange
roots of the carrot plant. A head of lettuce is just a bunch of crunchy
leaves. And asparagus is actually a stem of the tasty
asparagus plant! There are so many kinds of veggies out there,
that we can actually split this group into smaller groups. For example, there are dark green veggies,
like spinach. Starchy vegetables, like potatoes and sweet
potatoes. Then, there are red and orange veggies, like
beets and carrots, just to name a few. Now, what other foods can you think of? What about the stuff that’s inside your
sandwich? Meats, like chicken or hamburger, belong to
the protein group. And so do fish, like tuna, and eggs, made
any way you like! But not all members of this group come from
animals. Other foods like beans, peanut butter, and
tofu, which is made from soybeans, are full of protein, so they’re also proud members
of the protein group. And that leaves us with the last group, dairy. If a food is made from cow milk or soy milk,
it’s in the dairy group. So this is where you find things like yogurt,
and all kinds of cheeses, as well as your usual glass of milk. And do you know what else fits in this group? Ice cream! But that reminds me, sweet treats like candy
don’t fit into any of our groups. That’s because they’re made of mostly
sugar, and don’t have any of the things that our bodies need to stay healthy. So, it’s okay to enjoy these foods from
time to time … but just not a lot of the time. Now, do you think you can put a food into
the right group? Let’s take a tasty food quiz and see how
well we know our food groups! We’ll start with a slice of pineapple. What group do you think it goes in? Squeaks says the fruit group. Good job, Squeaks! Yes, pineapple belongs in the fruit group. What about this hard boiled egg? What group do you think this fits into? That’s right, the protein group. Eggs are a good source of protein. Here’s one more. We’ll end our game with a food that fits
into two groups: macaroni and cheese. Let’s look at each part separately. The cheese from the mac and cheese fits into
the dairy group, because it’s made from milk. But what about the macaroni noodles? Well, we learned earlier that noodles are
made of flour from grain. So, that means the macaroni belongs to the
grain group! That’s right! Macaroni and cheese contains foods that are
in the dairy group and the grain group. Whew! All this guessing has made me hungry! Hey Squeaks! Let’s make a snack! And remember, the next time you’re hungry
and head to the pantry or fridge…choose something healthy…and see if you can guess
what group your food fits into! Thanks for joining me us on SciShow Kids. Is there something you’d like to learn more
about? Get some help from a grown up and let us know

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the best kind of fruit in the fruit group, and the correct answer is "All of the above!" (fresh, canned, dried, and 100% fruit juice).

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest match, as it asks about an example of a fruit. However, it does not match the ground truth MCQ's intent and options.

A closer match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the types of fruit that belong to the fruit group. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this intent.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2, but with a low confidence level.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2 (with low confidence)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not closely match the ground truth MCQ, and a new generated MCQ that specifically asks about the types of fruit that belong to the fruit group would be a better match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of grains, while Question 7 asks about the key characteristic that distinguishes vegetables from fruits and provides information about the edible parts of plants, which includes grains.

However, a more relevant question that directly addresses the definition of grains is missing from the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that Question 7 is the closest, but it's not a perfect match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 7

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks, "Which of the following is NOT a member of the protein group?" and provides options that are all members of the protein group, making the correct answer "None of the above."

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the closest match in terms of content, as it discusses characteristics of food groups. However, it does not match the ground truth MCQ's intent.

A closer match in terms of intent is Question 2, which asks about an example of a fruit. While it does not ask about the protein group, it does ask about identifying a member of a specific food group.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 4, which asks about a food that belongs to more than one group. This question requires analysis of the food groups and their members, similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But since none of the questions match exactly, I will choose the one that has the most similar intent, which is not present. But if I really had to choose I would say 

 Question 4

**Transcript**:
Our bodies need lots of energy to keep us
going throughout the day. And do you know where we get that energy? That’s right…from the food we eat! And all kinds of different people enjoy different
kinds of food. But whether your favorite meal includes noodles
or nectarines, tortillas or tofu, most types of food have some of what our bodies need
to stay healthy. You might already know that we can put different
kinds of food into different groups. We call these, you guessed it, food groups! But let’s check out each group, and see
what kind of food belongs where! Let’s start with the fruit group. You gotta love sweet, delicious fruit! This group includes things like apples and
pears, oranges and strawberries. Fresh fruit is the best for you, but fruit
that’s canned or frozen counts, too. After all, many fruits are hard to find in
the winter, and some fruits only grow in certain parts of the world. But don’t forget about fruit that’s been
dried! Raisins are just dried grapes! And prunes are dried-up plums! And even juice is part of the fruit group,
but only if it’s all fruit juice and doesn’t have added sugar. Next comes the grain group. Grains are plants, like oats, wheat, and barley. If a food is made from one of these plants,
or any other grain plant, it belongs here. That means things made of flour, like bread
and noodles, breakfast foods like oatmeal and cereal, and even rice, are all part of
this group. Next up, the vegetable group. I bet you already figured out what goes here! Vegetables come from plants, too -- but unlike
grains, they’re either the roots, stems, or leaves of certain plants that we can eat! Carrots, for example, are the sweet orange
roots of the carrot plant. A head of lettuce is just a bunch of crunchy
leaves. And asparagus is actually a stem of the tasty
asparagus plant! There are so many kinds of veggies out there,
that we can actually split this group into smaller groups. For example, there are dark green veggies,
like spinach. Starchy vegetables, like potatoes and sweet
potatoes. Then, there are red and orange veggies, like
beets and carrots, just to name a few. Now, what other foods can you think of? What about the stuff that’s inside your
sandwich? Meats, like chicken or hamburger, belong to
the protein group. And so do fish, like tuna, and eggs, made
any way you like! But not all members of this group come from
animals. Other foods like beans, peanut butter, and
tofu, which is made from soybeans, are full of protein, so they’re also proud members
of the protein group. And that leaves us with the last group, dairy. If a food is made from cow milk or soy milk,
it’s in the dairy group. So this is where you find things like yogurt,
and all kinds of cheeses, as well as your usual glass of milk. And do you know what else fits in this group? Ice cream! But that reminds me, sweet treats like candy
don’t fit into any of our groups. That’s because they’re made of mostly
sugar, and don’t have any of the things that our bodies need to stay healthy. So, it’s okay to enjoy these foods from
time to time … but just not a lot of the time. Now, do you think you can put a food into
the right group? Let’s take a tasty food quiz and see how
well we know our food groups! We’ll start with a slice of pineapple. What group do you think it goes in? Squeaks says the fruit group. Good job, Squeaks! Yes, pineapple belongs in the fruit group. What about this hard boiled egg? What group do you think this fits into? That’s right, the protein group. Eggs are a good source of protein. Here’s one more. We’ll end our game with a food that fits
into two groups: macaroni and cheese. Let’s look at each part separately. The cheese from the mac and cheese fits into
the dairy group, because it’s made from milk. But what about the macaroni noodles? Well, we learned earlier that noodles are
made of flour from grain. So, that means the macaroni belongs to the
grain group! That’s right! Macaroni and cheese contains foods that are
in the dairy group and the grain group. Whew! All this guessing has made me hungry! Hey Squeaks! Let’s make a snack! And remember, the next time you’re hungry
and head to the pantry or fridge…choose something healthy…and see if you can guess
what group your food fits into! Thanks for joining me us on SciShow Kids. Is there something you’d like to learn more
about? Get some help from a grown up and let us know
in the comments below, or send us an email at kids@thescishow.com! And we’ll see you next time!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 7 does not directly address the dairy group, I re-examined the generated MCQs and found that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest, as it mentions macaroni and cheese, which is a food that belongs to the dairy group (cheese) and the grain group (macaroni).

But, if I were to choose a question that is similar in structure and intent, I would say that Question 7 is the closest.

 Nevertheless, I must point out that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 7

**Transcript**:
You’re cruising down the highway 
when all of a sudden endless rows of brake lights appear ahead. There’s no accident, no stoplight, no change in speed limit 
or narrowing of the road. So why the @#$%! is there 
so much traffic? When traffic comes to a near standstill 
for no apparent reason, it’s called a phantom traffic jam. A phantom traffic jam 
is an emergent phenomenon whose behavior takes on a life of its own,
greater than the sum of its parts. But in spite of this, 
we can actually model these jams, even understand the principles 
that shape them— and we’re closer than you might think to preventing this kind of traffic
in the future. For a phantom traffic jam to form, 
there must be a lot of cars on the road. That doesn’t mean 
there are necessarily too many cars to pass through a stretch 
of roadway smoothly, at least not if every driver maintains 
the same consistent speed and spacing from other drivers. In this dense, but flowing, traffic, it only takes a minor disturbance 
to set off the chain of events that causes a traffic jam. Say one driver brakes slightly. Each successive driver then brakes 
a little more strongly, creating a wave of brake lights 
that propagates backward through the cars on the road. These stop-and-go waves 
can travel along a highway for miles. With a low density of cars on the road, traffic flows smoothly 
because small disturbances, like individual cars changing lanes 
or slowing down at a curve, are absorbed by other 
drivers’ adjustments. But once the number of cars 
on the road exceeds a critical density, generally when cars are spaced 
less than 35 meters apart, the system’s behavior 
changes dramatically. It begins to display dynamic instability, 
meaning small disturbances are amplified. Dynamic instability isn’t unique 
to phantom traffic jams— it’s also responsible for raindrops, 
sand dunes, cloud patterns, and more. The instability is 
a positive feedback loop. Above the critical density, any additional vehicle reduces 
the number of cars per second passing through a given point on the road. This in turn means it takes longer 
for a local pileup to move out of a section of the road, 
increasing vehicle density even more, which eventually adds up 
to stop-and-go traffic. Drivers tend not to realize they need 
to break far in advance of a traffic jam, which means they end up having 
to brake harder to avoid a collision. This strengthens the wave of braking 
from vehicle to vehicle. What’s more, drivers tend to accelerate
too rapidly out of a slowdown, meaning they try to drive faster than the average flow of traffic 
downstream of them. Then, they have to brake again, 
eventually producing another feedback loop that causes more stop-and-go traffic. In both cases, drivers make traffic worse simply because they don’t have a good
sense of the conditions ahead of them. Self driving cars equipped with data 
on traffic conditions ahead from connected vehicles 
or roadway sensors might be able to counteract 
phantom traffic in real-time. These vehicles would maintain 
a uniform speed, safety permitting, that matches the average speed 
of the overall flow, preventing traffic waves from forming. In situations where there’s 
already a traffic wave, the automated vehicle 
would be able to anticipate it, braking sooner and more gradually 
than a human driver and reducing the strength of the wave. And it wouldn’t take that many 
self-driving cars— In a recent experiment, one autonomous 
vehicle for every 20 human drivers was enough to dampen 
and prevent traffic waves. Traffic jams are not only 
a daily annoyance– they’re a major cause of fatalities, wasted resources, 
and planet-threatening pollution. But new technology may help reduce 
these patterns, rendering our roads safer, our daily commutes more efficient, 
and our air cleaner. And the next time you’re stuck in traffic, it may help to remember that other drivers
aren’t necessarily driving spitefully, but are simply unaware of road 
conditions ahead— and drive accordingly.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is about identifying a phenomenon that is not caused by instability. The correct option is "Rush-hour traffic." 

Among the generated MCQs, the one that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content is not explicitly present. However, Question 3 discusses the phenomenon responsible for the amplification of small disturbances, which is related to instability.

Another possible match could be Question 8, which asks about the type of feedback loop responsible for amplifying small disturbances. Although it does not directly ask about phenomena not caused by instability, it deals with a related concept.

Given the available options, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match, but it is still not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
You’re cruising down the highway 
when all of a sudden endless rows of brake lights appear ahead. There’s no accident, no stoplight, no change in speed limit 
or narrowing of the road. So why the @#$%! is there 
so much traffic? When traffic comes to a near standstill 
for no apparent reason, it’s called a phantom traffic jam. A phantom traffic jam 
is an emergent phenomenon whose behavior takes on a life of its own,
greater than the sum of its parts. But in spite of this, 
we can actually model these jams, even understand the principles 
that shape them— and we’re closer than you might think to preventing this kind of traffic
in the future. For a phantom traffic jam to form, 
there must be a lot of cars on the road. That doesn’t mean 
there are necessarily too many cars to pass through a stretch 
of roadway smoothly, at least not if every driver maintains 
the same consistent speed and spacing from other drivers. In this dense, but flowing, traffic, it only takes a minor disturbance 
to set off the chain of events that causes a traffic jam. Say one driver brakes slightly. Each successive driver then brakes 
a little more strongly, creating a wave of brake lights 
that propagates backward through the cars on the road. These stop-and-go waves 
can travel along a highway for miles. With a low density of cars on the road, traffic flows smoothly 
because small disturbances, like individual cars changing lanes 
or slowing down at a curve, are absorbed by other 
drivers’ adjustments. But once the number of cars 
on the road exceeds a critical density, generally when cars are spaced 
less than 35 meters apart, the system’s behavior 
changes dramatically. It begins to display dynamic instability, 
meaning small disturbances are amplified. Dynamic instability isn’t unique 
to phantom traffic jams— it’s also responsible for raindrops, 
sand dunes, cloud patterns, and more. The instability is 
a positive feedback loop. Above the critical density, any additional vehicle reduces 
the number of cars per second passing through a given point on the road. This in turn means it takes longer 
for a local pileup to move out of a section of the road, 
increasing vehicle density even more, which eventually adds up 
to stop-and-go traffic. Drivers tend not to realize they need 
to break far in advance of a traffic jam, which means they end up having 
to brake harder to avoid a collision. This strengthens the wave of braking 
from vehicle to vehicle. What’s more, drivers tend to accelerate
too rapidly out of a slowdown, meaning they try to drive faster than the average flow of traffic 
downstream of them. Then, they have to brake again, 
eventually producing another feedback loop that causes more stop-and-go traffic. In both cases, drivers make traffic worse simply because they don’t have a good
sense of the conditions ahead of them. Self driving cars equipped with data 
on traffic conditions ahead from connected vehicles 
or roadway sensors might be able to counteract 
phantom traffic in real-time. These vehicles would maintain 
a uniform speed, safety permitting, that matches the average speed 
of the overall flow, preventing traffic waves from forming. In situations where there’s 
already a traffic wave, the automated vehicle 
would be able to anticipate it, braking sooner and more gradually 
than a human driver and reducing the strength of the wave. And it wouldn’t take that many 
self-driving cars— In a recent experiment, one autonomous 
vehicle for every 20 human drivers was enough to dampen 
and prevent traffic waves. Traffic jams are not only 
a daily annoyance– they’re a major cause of fatalities, wasted resources, 
and planet-threatening pollution. But new technology may help reduce 
these patterns, rendering our roads safer, our daily commutes more efficient, 
and our air cleaner. And the next time you’re stuck in traffic, it may help to remember that other drivers
aren’t necessarily driving spitefully, but are simply unaware of road 
conditions ahead— and drive accordingly.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

Although Question 6 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the benefits of eliminating phantom traffic jams, while Question 6 asks about what can be used to reduce traffic congestion and improve road safety. Both questions are related to the benefits of addressing traffic congestion.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as they do not ask about the specific benefits of eliminating phantom traffic jams. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 6.

[Music] welcome to brightly story time i'm miss linda and as you can see i am very much in the holiday spirit and so ready to read one of my very favorite holiday books hey where did my book go grinch come out here grinch that's not very nice if you steal my book then all the boys and girls of brightlyville won't get to hear this story [Music] thank you grinch your heart is not so small after all in fact i heard that the grinch and random house kids are working with feeding america to help people who might be hungry this holiday season isn't that right well that's great well now i can't wait to read our story today how the grinch stole christmas by dr seuss every who down in whoville liked christmas a lot but the grinch who lived just north of whoville did not the grinch hated christmas the whole christmas season now please don't ask why no one quite knows the reason it could be his head wasn't screwed on just right it could be perhaps that his shoes were too tight [Music] but i think that the most likely reason of all may have been that his heart was two sizes too small but whatever the reason his heart or his shoes he stood there on christmas eve hating the whos staring down from his cave with a sour grinchy frown at the warm lighted windows below in their town for he knew every who down in whoville beneath was busy now hanging a mistletoe wreath [Music] and they're hanging their stockings he snarled with a sneer tomorrow is christmas it's practically here then he growled with his grinch fingers nervously drumming i must find some way to stop christmas from coming for tomorrow he knew all the who girls and boys would wake bright and early they'd rush for their toys and then oh the noise oh the noise noise noise noise that's one thing he hated the noise noise noise noise then the whos young and old would sit down to a feast and they'd feast and they'd feast and they'd feast feast feast feast they would feast on who pudding and rare who roast beast which was something the grinch couldn't stand in the least [Music] and then they'd do something he liked least of all every who down in whoville the tall and the small would stand close together with christmas bells ringing they'd stand hand in hand and the whos would start singing they'd sing and they'd sing and they'd sing sing sing sing [Music] and the more the grinch thought of this who christmas sing the more the grinch thought i must stop this whole thing why for 53 years i've put up with it now i must stop this christmas from coming but how then he got an idea an awful idea the grinch got a wonderful awful idea i know just what to do the grinch laughed in his throat and he made a quick santy claws hat and a coat [Music] and he chuckled and clucked what a great grinchy trick with this coat and this hat i look just like saint nick all i need is a reindeer the grinch looked around but since reindeer are scarce there was none to be found did that stop the old grinch no the grinch simply said if i can't find a reindeer i'll make one instead so he called his dog max then he took some red thread and he tied a big horn on the top of his head [Music] then he loaded some bags and some old empty sacks on a ramshackle sleigh and he hitched up old max then the grinch said get up and the sleigh started down toward the homes where the whos lay a snooze in their town all their windows were dark quiet snow filled the air all the whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care when he came to the first little house on the square this is stop number one the old grinchy claws hissed and he climbed to the roof empty bags in his fist then he slid down the chimney a rather tight pinch but if santa could do it then so could the grinch he got stuck only once for a moment or two then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flew [Music] were the little who stockings all hung in a row these stockings he grinned are the first things to go then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant around the whole room and he took every present pop guns and bicycles roller skates drums checkerboards tricycles popcorn and plums [Music] and he stuffed them in bags then the grinch very nimbly stuffed all the bags one by one up the chimbley then he slunk to the icebox he took the who's feast he took the who pudding he took the roast beast [Music] he cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash why that grinch even took their last can of who hash [Music] then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee and now grinned the grinch i will stuff up the tree and the grinch grabbed the tree and he started to shove when he heard a small sound like the coup of a dove [Music] he turned around fast and he saw a small who little cindy lou who who was not more than two [Music] the grinch had been caught by this tiny hoo daughter who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water she stared at the grinch and said santy claus why why are you taking our christmas tree why [Music] but you know that old grinch was so smart and so slick he thought up a lie and he thought it up quick why my sweet little tot the fake santy claws lied there's a light on this tree that won't light on one side [Music] so i'm taking it home to my workshop my dear i'll fix it up there then i'll bring it back here and his fib fooled the child then he patted her head and he got her a drink and he sent her to bed [Music] and when cindy lou who went to bed with her cup he went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up then the last thing he took was the log for their fire then he went up the chimney himself the old liar on their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire [Music] and the one speck of food that he left in the house was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse then he did the same thing to the other who's houses leaving crumbs much too small for the other whose mouses it was quarter past dawn all the who's still a bed all the who's still a snooze when he packed up his sled [Music] packed it up with their presents the ribbons the wrappings the tags and the tinsel the trimmings the trappings [Music] three thousand feet up up the side of mount crumpet he rode with his load to the tip top to dump it pooh pooh to the whos he was grinchishly humming they're finding out now that no christmas is coming [Music] they're just waking up i know just what they'll do their mouths will hang open a minute or two then the who's down in whoville will all cry boo hoo that's a noise grinned the grinch that i simply must hear so he paused and the grinch put his hand to his ear [Music] and he did hear a sound rising over the snow it started in low then it started to grow but the sound wasn't sad why the sound sounded merry it couldn't be so but it was mary very [Music] he stared down at whoville the grinch popped his eyes then he shook what he saw was a shocking surprise [Music] every who down in whoville the tall and the small was singing without any presence at all [Music] he hadn't stopped christmas from coming it came somehow or other it came just the same and the grinch with his grinch feet ice cold in the snow stood puzzling and puzzling how could it be so [Music] it came without ribbons it came without tags it came without packages boxes or bags [Music] and he puzzled three hours till his puzzler was sore then the grinch thought of something he hadn't before [Music] maybe christmas he thought doesn't come from a store maybe christmas perhaps means a little bit more [Music] and what happened then well in whoville they say that the grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day and the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight he whizzed with his load through the bright morning light and he brought back the toys and the food for the feast and he he himself the grinch carved the roast beast what a wonderful story i'm so glad that our friend the grinch had a change of heart if you do something nice for someone this holiday season share it using the hashtag grow your heart to be part of the good deeds random house kids and the grinch are doing with feeding america come back for more brightly story time soon or find books to read

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 4: What is the significance of the Whos' celebration of Christmas? Options: A. It's only about material gifts, B. It's only about community and joy, C. It's a combination of material gifts and community joy, D. It's a time for solitude and reflection Correct Option: C

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that directly asks about the Whos' reaction to discovering that the Grinch took their presents and food.

A more suitable match can be inferred from Question 6 or Question 10's correct option and the context provided by the story. When the Whos discover that the Grinch took their presents and food, they sing, which indicates that Christmas is more than just material gifts for them.

Considering this, the most similar generated MCQ would be:

Question 10: What realization does the Grinch come to about Christmas? Options: A. It's only about material gifts, B. It's only about community and joy, C. It's a combination of material gifts and community joy, D. Maybe Christmas doesn't come from a store, maybe it means a little bit more Correct Option: D

This question captures the essence of the Whos' reaction to the Grinch's actions and the true meaning of Christmas.

However, if we were to rewrite the generated MCQs to perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, it would look something like this:

Question: What do the Whos do when they discover that the Grinch took their presents and food? Options: A. Cry, B. Shout, C. Sing, D. Dance Correct Option: C

Since this exact question is not present in the generated MCQs, the closest match is:

Question 10.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 10.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the one that is most similar in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the word tail (or word ending) that the "sticky I" likes best. The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of mentioning a word that contains the "sticky I" sound.

However, if I had to choose a question that is somewhat related to word endings, I would say that Question 7 is the closest. It talks about the representation of the "sticky I" sound in words, which is related to word endings.

But since none of the questions directly ask about the word tail that the "sticky I" likes best, I will choose Question 2 as the most similar, as it is the closest in terms of mentioning a word that contains the "sticky I" sound.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: Which of the following words contains the "sticky I" sound? Options: A. Dog, B. Nation, C. Car, D. Apple Correct Option: B**

However, this question is not a perfect match, as it asks for a word that contains the "sticky I" sound, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks for a word that does NOT contain the "sticky I" sound.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks for a word that does not contain the "sticky I" sound, but such a question is not present in the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose the closest match based on the available options, I would choose:

**Question 2**

But since it's not a perfect match, I'll keep looking for a better option.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I found that **Question 6** is not a good match, but **Question 1** is not relevant to the ground truth MCQ. However, I noticed that some questions are related to the importance of recognizing the "sticky I" sound, but none of them match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

If I had to choose the best match from the available options, I would say that **Question 2** is still the closest match, but it's not a perfect match.

However, I must note that **Question 6: What is an example of applying the knowledge of the "sticky I" sound? Options: A. Ignoring the sound when reading, B. Using it to create rhyming words, C. Identifying the sound in everyday words, D. Avoiding words that contain the sound Correct Option: C** has an option D that says "Avoiding words that contain the sound", which is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

But if I really had to choose the best match from the available options, I would say that **Question 2** is still the closest match.

Since I was asked to provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, I will provide the index of **Question 2**, which is:

**2**

However, please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more suitable match would be a question that asks for a word that does not contain the "sticky I" sound.

**Transcript**:
You’ve been accused of a crime 
you did not commit. It’s impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist that you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty 
and executed. But if you confess, apologize, 
and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession— 
or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing 
those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts 
between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia 
about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor— and a justice system that valued 
repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, 
a group of English protestants. Life was strict and isolated 
for the people of Salem. Battles with their 
Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers
were commonplace. People feared starvation and disease, and relations between villagers 
were strained. To make matters worse, 1692 brought 
one of the coldest winters on record. That winter, two cousins, 9 year old Betty Parris and 
11 year old Abigail Williams started behaving very strangely. A physician found nothing 
physically wrong — but diagnosed the girls 
as under “an evil hand.” Puritans believed that the Devil wreaked 
havoc in the world through human agents, or witches, who blighted nature, 
conjured fiendish apparitions, and tormented children. As news swept through the village, 
the symptoms appeared to spread. Accounts describe 12 so-called 
“afflicted” girls contorting their bodies, having fits, 
and complaining of prickling skin. Four of the girls soon accused three
local women of tormenting them. All three of the accused were considered 
outsiders in some way. On February 29th, 
the authorities arrested Sarah Good, a poor pregnant mother 
of a young daughter, Sarah Osbourne,
who had long been absent from church and was suing the family 
of one of her accusers, and Tituba, an enslaved woman 
in Betty Parris’s home known by her first name only. Tituba denied harming the girls at first. But then she confessed to practicing 
witchcraft on the Devil’s orders, and charged Good and Osbourne 
with having forced her. Osbourne and Good both 
maintained their innocence. Osbourne died in prison, while Good’s 
husband turned against her in court, testifying that she "was a witch 
or would be one very quickly." Good’s 4 year old daughter 
was imprisoned and eventually gave testimony 
against her mother. Meanwhile, Good gave birth in jail. Her baby died, and she was convicted 
and hanged shortly thereafter. Tituba was held in custody until May,
and then released. These three victims were 
just the beginning. As accusations multiplied, 
others, like Tituba, made false confession to save themselves. The authorities even reportedly 
told one accused witch that she would be hanged if she did not 
confess, and freed if she did. They were not particularly interested
in thoroughly investigating the charges— in keeping with their Church’s teachings, 
they preferred that the accused confessed, asked for forgiveness, and promised 
not to engage in more witchcraft. The court accepted all kinds 
of dubious evidence, including so-called “spectral evidence” in which the girls began raving when 
supposedly touched by invisible ghosts. Complicating matters further, 
many of the jurors in the trials were relatives of the accusers,
compromising their objectivity. Those who dared to speak out, 
such as Judge Nathanial Saltonstall, came under suspicion. By the spring of 1693, 
over a hundred people had been imprisoned, and 14 women 
and 6 men had been executed. By this time, accusations were starting 
to spread beyond Salem to neighboring communities, and even 
the most powerful figures were targets. When his own wife was accused, the governor of Massachusetts colony 
suspended the trials. Sentences were amended, 
prisoners released, and arrests stopped. Some have speculated that the girls 
were suffering from hallucinations caused by fungus; or a condition that caused 
swelling of the brain. But ultimately, the reason 
for their behavior is unknown. What we do know is that adults 
accepted wild accusations by children as hard evidence. Today, the Salem Witch Trials remain 
a cautionary tale of the dangers of groupthink 
and scapegoating, and the power of fear 
to manipulate human perception.

and hanged shortly thereafter. Tituba was held in custody until May,
and then released. These three victims were 
just the beginning. As accusations multiplied, 
others, like Tituba, made false confession to save themselves. The authorities even reportedly 
told one accused witch that she would be hanged if she did not 
confess, and freed if she did. They were not particularly interested
in thoroughly investigating the charges— in keeping with their Church’s teachings, 
they preferred that the accused confessed, asked for forgiveness, and promised 
not to engage in more witchcraft. The court accepted all kinds 
of dubious evidence, including so-called “spectral evidence” in which the girls began raving when 
supposedly touched by invisible ghosts. Complicating matters further, 
many of the jurors in the trials were relatives of the accusers,
compromising their objectivity. Those who dared to speak out, 
such as Judge Nathanial Saltonstall, came under suspicion. By the spring of 1693, 
over a hundred people had been imprisoned, and 14 women 
and 6 men had been executed. By this time, accusations were starting 
to spread beyond Salem to neighboring communities, and even 
the most powerful figures were targets. When his own wife was accused, the governor of Massachusetts colony 
suspended the trials. Sentences were amended, 
prisoners released, and arrests stopped. Some have speculated that the girls 
were suffering from hallucinations caused by fungus; or a condition that caused 
swelling of the brain. But ultimately, the reason 
for their behavior is unknown. What we do know is that adults 
accepted wild accusations by children as hard evidence. Today, the Salem Witch Trials remain 
a cautionary tale of the dangers of groupthink 
and scapegoating, and the power of fear 
to manipulate human perception.

**Transcript**:
You’ve been accused of a crime 
you did not commit. It’s impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist that you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty 
and executed. But if you confess, apologize, 
and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession— 
or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing 
those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts 
between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia 
about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor— and a justice system that valued 
repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, 
a group of English protestants. Life was strict and isolated 
for the people of Salem. Battles with their 
Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers
were commonplace. People feared starvation and disease, and relations between villagers 
were strained. To make matters worse, 1692 brought 
one of the coldest winters on record. That winter, two cousins, 9 year old Betty Parris and 
11 year old Abigail Williams started behaving very strangely. A physician found nothing 
physically wrong — but diagnosed the girls 
as under “an evil hand.” Puritans believed that the Devil wreaked 
havoc in the world through human agents, or witches, who blighted nature, 
conjured fiendish apparitions, and tormented children. As news swept through the village, 
the symptoms appeared to spread. Accounts describe 12 so-called 
“afflicted” girls contorting their bodies, having fits, 
and complaining of prickling skin. Four of the girls soon accused three
local women of tormenting them. All three of the accused were considered 
outsiders in some way. On February 29th, 
the authorities arrested Sarah Good, a poor pregnant mother 
of a young daughter, Sarah Osbourne,
who had long been absent from church and was suing the family 
of one of her accusers, and Tituba, an enslaved woman 
in Betty Parris’s home known by her first name only. Tituba denied harming the girls at first. But then she confessed to practicing 
witchcraft on the Devil’s orders, and charged Good and Osbourne 
with having forced her. Osbourne and Good both 
maintained their innocence. Osbourne died in prison, while Good’s 
husband turned against her in court, testifying that she "was a witch 
or would be one very quickly." Good’s 4 year old daughter 
was imprisoned and eventually gave testimony 
against her mother. Meanwhile, Good gave birth in jail. Her baby died, and she was convicted 
and hanged shortly thereafter. Tituba was held in custody until May,
and then released. These three victims were 
just the beginning. As accusations multiplied, 
others, like Tituba, made false confession to save themselves. The authorities even reportedly 
told one accused witch that she would be hanged if she did not 
confess, and freed if she did. They were not particularly interested
in thoroughly investigating the charges— in keeping with their Church’s teachings, 
they preferred that the accused confessed, asked for forgiveness, and promised 
not to engage in more witchcraft. The court accepted all kinds 
of dubious evidence, including so-called “spectral evidence” in which the girls began raving when 
supposedly touched by invisible ghosts. Complicating matters further,

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 8: What was the impact of the trials on the community?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the outcome of the Salem Witch Trials, specifically the number of executions and the release of prisoners. Question 8 asks about the impact of the trials on the community, which includes the execution of innocent people and the destruction of reputations.

However, another question that closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of content is:

**Question 2: How many men were executed during the Salem Witch Trials?**

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ in that it asks about the number of executions, but it only asks about the number of men executed, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the total number of executions and the release of prisoners.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the options provided, I would choose:

**Question 8 is not the best match, Question 2 is not the best match, but Question 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are not matches**

However **Question 8 and Question 2, and other questions are not the best match** 

The best match is: 

**No direct match exists as the questions are quite different, however Question 2 is the closest.**

Hi! OK everybody... The English language has many words. Like this. Ho! So many words! And every word can be split into parts. We call these parts syllables. A word could have one, or two, or three, or
four, or even more syllables. Could a word have 1 million syllables? No, that is too many syllables. What about four syllables? Yes, I already said that. Ha! No more questions! Anyway! A syllable is like a beat. Do you know what a beat is? DRUMMER! Please play a beat. Thank you. That is a good beat. You can make a beat by clapping your hands. Get those hands up! Let’s practice one beat. OK ready, here we go: Clap! Ho ho! Now let's try it with some words. We will start with the easy ones. Words with one syllable - and therefore - one

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I would recommend Question 2 as the closest match.

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the number of syllables in the word "dog," it does ask about the number of syllables in different words, including an option with the word that has one syllable (not "dog" but an option that could be used to infer the answer to the ground truth MCQ).

However, if I had to choose an option that is most similar in terms of the content (the number of syllables in a word), I would suggest Question 7. It does not ask about a specific word but asks about the relationship between the number of syllables in a word and the number of beats it has.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the number of syllables in the word "dog" or a similar word with one syllable.

Given the options, I would choose Question 7 as a more suitable match, but please note that it is not an exact match.

Hi! OK everybody... The English language has many words. Like this. Ho! So many words! And every word can be split into parts. We call these parts syllables. A word could have one, or two, or three, or
four, or even more syllables. Could a word have 1 million syllables? No, that is too many syllables. What about four syllables? Yes, I already said that. Ha! No more questions! Anyway! A syllable is like a beat. Do you know what a beat is? DRUMMER! Please play a beat. Thank you. That is a good beat. You can make a beat by clapping your hands. Get those hands up!

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 2: Which of the following words has four syllables? Options: A. Apple, B. Ladybug, C. Dog, D. Salamander Correct Option: D

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about a word with four syllables, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the number of syllables in the word "ladybug".

A more similar question would be one that directly asks about the number of syllables in a specific word. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose:

None of the questions directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 2 is the closest in terms of content.

But since it does not match the intent, I will try to find another question that is similar in intent.

In this case, I would say that Question 7 is similar in intent, as it talks about the relationship between the number of syllables in a word and the number of beats it has. However, it is still not a direct match.

If I really had to choose one, I would say that the most similar question is not available, but if I really had to choose from the existing options, I would say:

 Question 2 is not the correct answer,  I made a mistake, the correct answer is not available, however the closest would be  Question 11: it talks about judging the number of syllables, it does have the same intent as the original question however the answer and the options do not match.

However I must say that the original MCQ was not found, the one with the most similar intent was question 11

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: Which of the following words has four syllables? Options: A. Apple, B. Ladybug, C. Dog, D. Salamander Correct Option: D.

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options, as the ground truth MCQ is a true or false question about the number of syllables in the word "salamander". 

A more similar question would be one that directly asks about the number of syllables in the word "salamander" or one that asks whether a statement about the number of syllables in "salamander" is true or false.

Since there isn't a more similar question, I will choose Question 2 as the closest match, but with the caveat that it's not an exact match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks if the respondent has ever been a producer, which is a personal and reflective question. Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest in terms of relevance to the concept of producers and consumers, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ's intent.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 5, which mentions a person running a small business as an example of a producer-consumer relationship. This question is still not a direct match, but it is the closest in terms of exploring the concept of producers and consumers in a more personal context.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

This is because both the ground truth MCQ and Question 1 focus on defining the role of a producer. The ground truth MCQ asks "A producer is someone who" and provides options that distinguish between providing goods and services (Option A) and consuming or buying goods (Options B and C). 

Similarly, Question 1 asks "What is the primary role of a producer in the economy?" and provides options that distinguish between making a good or providing a service (Option C) and other incorrect options (A, B, and D). 

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 1.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs directly ask if kids can be producers, which is the main intent of the ground truth MCQ. But Question 5 does mention a scenario where a person (including a kid) can be a producer, which is running a small business, such as a lemonade stand.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 5

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options in Question 2 do not exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the role of a kid selling lemonade. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the closest one, I would say Question 2 is the closest, but with some differences in the options.

But since the options in Question 2 do not match the ground truth MCQ, I will try to find another question that is similar. Question 5 has an option that mentions "a person running a small business" which could be similar to a kid selling lemonade.

However, I noticed that Question 2 has an option B that says "A kid running a lemonade stand" which is the opposite of what the correct answer should be in the context of the ground truth MCQ.

Considering all these factors, I would say that the closest match is Question 2, but with some differences in the options.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: Which of the following is an example of a consumer? 

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that directly asks about the role of the person cutting the hair. 

A question that is more similar in intent is Question 6: What is an example of a service that a producer can provide to a consumer? 

But an even more similar question in terms of content is not present among the generated MCQs. However, if we had to choose one, it would be Question 2, but since the options don't match our ground truth MCQ, let's look at another question.

Question 7 and other questions also don't match our ground truth MCQ. However, looking at the options of our generated MCQs, Question 1 has an option C that says "To make a good or provide a service" which is similar to what a producer does, and our ground truth MCQ asks about a person providing a service (cutting hair).

Our ground truth MCQ is asking whether the person cutting the hair is a producer or consumer. So the most similar generated MCQ based on the intent would be Question 1.

So the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 1.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about identifying a letter that is NOT a vowel, which implies that the question is about understanding the classification of letters into vowels and consonants.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is about understanding the association of letters with sounds and words, but it does not specifically address the classification of letters into vowels and consonants.

However, I would suggest that Question 7 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it deals with the pattern between letters and their sounds, which is related to the concept of vowels and consonants.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

7

Please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the question of identifying a letter that is NOT a vowel.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 11: What is the effectiveness of the "See it, say it, sign it" approach for learning the alphabet?**

Although this question does not directly ask about American Sign Language (ASL) signs for every letter, it implies that the "See it, say it, sign it" approach is effective for learning the alphabet, which includes associating letters with their corresponding ASL signs. The correct option, "C. It is an engaging and interactive way to learn the alphabet", indirectly supports the idea that every letter has its own special ASL sign, as the approach emphasizes signing each letter.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the closest match based on the available options, I would choose Question 11.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **11**

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What is the main concept being taught by the speaker through the game of "cops and robbers"? 

However, the options provided in Question 3 do not directly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A closer match in terms of question intent and options would be a question that directly asks about the definition of "law" as presented in the transcript.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the definition of "law." However, based on the available options, Question 3 is the closest match in terms of question intent.

But since it doesn't directly ask about the definition of law, it would be best to create a new question or modify an existing one to match the ground truth MCQ more closely.

That being said, if I had to choose one from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but with a caveat that it's not a perfect match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of a "lawn," which is mentioned in the transcript as part of the speaker's laws ("keep off the grass" and "i arrest you in the name of the lawn"). While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the definition of a "lawn," Question 2 mentions the law "keep off the grass" as one of the options.

Although not a perfect match, I would suggest Question 2 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it is the only one that mentions the concept of "grass" or "lawn" in relation to the speaker's laws.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest the most similar generated MCQ based on the question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the Alphablocks taking the word "law" and adding an "N" to the end of the word, resulting in a new word that describes something. The correct option is "the grass" because the new word is "lawn".

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 2: "Which of the following laws is NOT mentioned by the speaker?". Although this question does not directly relate to the word "law" and adding an "N" to the end, it does mention the concept of laws and rules, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ. However, the options and content do not exactly match.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the word "law" and its modification to form a new word. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this criteria.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would suggest Question 2, but with a low confidence level due to the mismatch in question intent, options, and content.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about what can "haunt" according to the video, and the correct answer is "A ghost." While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, I found that Question 8 has some relevance to the concept of ghosts, as it mentions the speaker's laws being "arbitrary and humorous" and includes a scenario where the speaker arrests themselves for being a ghost.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 2 is the most similar in terms of intent, as it asks about something that is NOT mentioned by the speaker. Similarly, the ground truth MCQ asks about what CAN "haunt" according to the video.

But the most similar generated MCQ in terms of content is actually none of the above. Since the generated MCQs do not directly address the concept of "haunting," I must choose the one that has the closest match in terms of intent or content.

In this case, I would choose Question 8 as the most similar generated MCQ, but with a low confidence level due to the significant differences between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 8

**Transcript**:
A baby cursed at birth. 
A fierce battle of good and evil. A true love awoken with a kiss. Sleeping Beauty is one of the world’s 
favorite folktales. But one of its most famous renditions
tells the story without a single word. Since premiering in 1890, "The Sleeping Beauty" has become one of the most frequently staged 
ballets in history. So what makes this piece so beloved? And what exactly does ballet bring 
to this— or any other story? At the heart of ballet 
are dozens of gestures that dancers painstakingly perfect
over thousands of hours of practice. This unique set of gestures 
has been used for centuries, each movement rich with meaning 
and history. But you don’t need to study them 
to understand ballet, any more than you need to study 
music to be moved by a song. And just as composers combine notes 
and phrases to form pieces of music, choreographers string these gestures 
together with new movements to form expressive combinations. Working alongside the orchestra’s 
live score, ballerinas precisely perform these 
combinations to convey narrative, emotion, and character. In "The Sleeping Beauty’s" opening scene, a flurry of techniques depicts 
the fairy court bestowing gifts on baby Princess Aurora. The Fairy of Generosity 
delicately walks “en pointe”— meaning on the tips of her toes— in step with the light plucking 
of violins. The ballerina moves in perfect harmony 
with the music, even mimicing the violins’ trill 
with an elegant bourrée. The Fairy of Temperance, bestowing 
the gift of strong will on Aurora, is choreographed as if shooting bolts 
of electricity from her fingers. She bounds across the stage, spinning with quick chaînés 
before decisively jetéing. Some movements are even more literal 
than this. The evil fairy Carabosse curses 
the princess with a lethal “X,” and the benevolent Lilac Fairy 
counters that curse. Of course, the relationship 
between music and movement isn’t always this straightforward. While classical ballet gestures 
often respond to musical elements, the degree to which the dancers 
and orchestra align is another choreographic tool. Some characters and scenes move 
in sync to create rhythmic clarity, while others deliberately diverge 
from the orchestra. Dancers and musicians maintain 
this delicate balance throughout each performance, engaging in a live negotiation 
of speed and rhythm. But prior to the performance, 
a ballet’s most important relationship is between the choreographer 
and the music. Choreographer Marius Petipa 
and composer Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky worked together on every second 
of "The Sleeping Beauty." This is particularly noticeable 
in Princess Aurora’s exuberant entrance on her 16th birthday. Tchaikovsky’s enthusiastic music 
tumbles forward in fits and starts, even cutting short some musical 
phrases to capture her impatience. Petipa choreographs Aurora bouncing 
back and forth with “pas de chat”— French for "cat steps"— 
as she waits for her party to begin. Once the celebration starts,
it’s up to the dancers to deliver on the physical spectacle of performing
these gestures with grace. Aurora has the hardest part of all: 
her famous Rose Adagio. As four suitors vie for her hand, the Princess performs a dizzying array 
of balances, all en pointe. She briefly takes each suitor’s hand, 
but then balances unassisted— a breath-taking display 
of physical strength and skill. However, it’s not just technique 
that carries meaning, but also style and personality. Like an actor delivering their lines, ballerinas can execute their movements
to convey a wide range of emotion. Aurora can be elegant and restrained, throwing her arms in independence 
from her suitors. Or she can be coy and flirtatious,
descending from en pointe with grace and knowing confidence. "The Sleeping Beauty" offers a showcase
for so much of what ballet can do. Its graceful spectacle, 
dramatic physical vocabulary, and enchanting coordination 
of music and movement perfectly reflect the themes 
of this fantastical romance. But ballet isn’t just for epic fairytales. Ballets can be non-narrative 
emotional journeys, experimental deconstructions of form, or pure demonstrations of skill. The artform is always experimenting 
with a centuries old set of rules, making it the perfect medium 
for stories old and new.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 7: How does the relationship between music and movement contribute to the overall effect of the ballet?**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer match is not found in the provided generated MCQs, but if I had to choose one based on the relationship between music and another entity, I would choose:

**Question 4: What is the relationship between music and movement in ballet?**

However, this question is still not a perfect match.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that none of them directly ask about the relationship between a specific entity (e.g., choreographer, conductor, ballerina, orchestra musicians) and the music. Therefore, I must conclude that there is no perfect match among the provided generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the relationship between two entities, I would choose:

**Question 2: Who choreographed and composed "The Sleeping Beauty" ballet?**

This question mentions the relationship between the choreographer (Marius Petipa) and the composer (Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky), which is related to the relationship between the choreographer and the music.

However, please note that this is still not a perfect match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the topic of ballet terminology.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the term for dancing on the tips of the toes, which is "en pointe." While there isn't a generated MCQ that directly asks this question, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to ballet terminology and gestures.

Generated MCQ 3 asks about the significance of the unique set of gestures in ballet, which includes the concept of dancing "en pointe." Although it doesn't directly ask about the term "en pointe," it is related to the topic of ballet terminology and gestures.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say:

Index: 3

Please note that this is a weak match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the question asked in the ground truth MCQ. A better match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the term "en pointe" or a related concept.

**Transcript**:
A baby cursed at birth. 
A fierce battle of good and evil. A true love awoken with a kiss. Sleeping Beauty is one of the world’s 
favorite folktales. But one of its most famous renditions
tells the story without a single word. Since premiering in 1890, "The Sleeping Beauty" has become one of the most frequently staged 
ballets in history. So what makes this piece so beloved? And what exactly does ballet bring 
to this— or any other story? At the heart of ballet 
are dozens of gestures that dancers painstakingly perfect
over thousands of hours of practice. This unique set of gestures 
has been used for centuries, each movement rich with meaning 
and history. But you don’t need to study them 
to understand ballet, any more than you need to study 
music to be moved by a song. And just as composers combine notes 
and phrases to form pieces of music, choreographers string these gestures 
together with new movements to form expressive combinations. Working alongside the orchestra’s 
live score, ballerinas precisely perform these 
combinations to convey narrative, emotion, and character. In "The Sleeping Beauty’s" opening scene, a flurry of techniques depicts 
the fairy court bestowing gifts on baby Princess Aurora. The Fairy of Generosity 
delicately walks “en pointe”— meaning on the tips of her toes— in step with the light plucking 
of violins. The ballerina moves in perfect harmony 
with the music, even mimicing the violins’ trill 
with an elegant bourrée. The Fairy of Temperance, bestowing 
the gift of strong will on Aurora, is choreographed as if shooting bolts 
of electricity from her fingers. She bounds across the stage, spinning with quick chaînés 
before decisively jetéing. Some movements are even more literal 
than this. The evil fairy Carabosse curses 
the princess with a lethal “X,” and the benevolent Lilac Fairy 
counters that curse. Of course, the relationship 
between music and movement isn’t always this straightforward. While classical ballet gestures 
often respond to musical elements, the degree to which the dancers 
and orchestra align is another choreographic tool. Some characters and scenes move 
in sync to create rhythmic clarity, while others deliberately diverge 
from the orchestra. Dancers and musicians maintain 
this delicate balance throughout each performance, engaging in a live negotiation 
of speed and rhythm. But prior to the performance, 
a ballet’s most important relationship is between the choreographer 
and the music. Choreographer Marius Petipa 
and composer Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky worked together on every second 
of "The Sleeping Beauty." This is particularly noticeable 
in Princess Aurora’s exuberant entrance on her 16th birthday. Tchaikovsky’s enthusiastic music 
tumbles forward in fits and starts, even cutting short some musical 
phrases to capture her impatience. Petipa choreographs Aurora bouncing 
back and forth with “pas de chat”— French for "cat steps"— 
as she waits for her party to begin. Once the celebration starts,
it’s up to the dancers to deliver on the physical spectacle of performing
these gestures with grace. Aurora has the hardest part of all: 
her famous Rose Adagio. As four suitors vie for her hand, the Princess performs a dizzying array 
of balances, all en pointe. She briefly takes each suitor’s hand, 
but then balances unassisted— a breath-taking display 
of physical strength and skill. However, it’s not just technique 
that carries meaning, but also style and personality. Like an actor delivering their lines, ballerinas can execute their movements
to convey a wide range of emotion. Aurora can be elegant and restrained, throwing her arms in independence 
from her suitors. Or she can be coy and flirtatious,
descending from en pointe with grace and knowing confidence. "The Sleeping Beauty" offers a showcase
for so much of what ballet can do. Its graceful spectacle, 
dramatic physical vocabulary, and enchanting coordination 
of music and movement perfectly reflect the themes 
of this fantastical romance. But ballet isn’t just for epic fairytales. Ballets can be non-narrative 
emotional journeys, experimental deconstructions of form, or pure demonstrations of skill. The artform is always experimenting 
with a centuries old set of rules, making it the perfect medium 
for stories old and new.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the physical prowess required from Aurora in the "Rose Adagio" scene. The closest generated MCQ is Question 3, which discusses the significance of the unique set of gestures in ballet, including conveying narrative, emotion, and character. However, this question does not specifically mention the "Rose Adagio" scene or Aurora's physical prowess.

A more relevant question would be one that focuses on the technical aspects of ballet, such as Question 8, but it still does not specifically address the "Rose Adagio" scene.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3, but with a note that it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
I teach history at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. On February 14, 2018, my school experienced one of the worst
mass school shootings in American history. People want to know what we saw, what I felt. I don't remember everything, but I do remember I went into crisis mode, mother mode. There was no emotion. I lined up the kids, I held up a sign so they could
follow me through the hall, just like a fire drill. I heard shots from one direction. Luckily, we were already
moving in the opposite direction. We made it outside. We made it to safety. I called my mother. "I'm OK." I called my husband. "I'm OK." Then my daughter called, my voice cracked,
and I knew I had to pull myself together. I sat alone in my thoughts, worried about my colleagues and students. We sat there, only understanding
that somehow, Valentine's Day -- We sat there, only understanding
that somehow, Valentine's Day had ended up with our babies dead, and we didn't know what to do next. It's been two months, and every day I still hear the echoes
of the "pop, pop" sound of the gunfire. I remember the fearful faces
of my students when we knew it wasn't a drill. Still, there's no constant emotion, except for flashes
of pain, grief and anger triggered by the news, or an insensitive comment, or just silence. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School
lost 17 precious lives on that horrible day. After, students asked us, the adults the hardest question: How can we stop the senseless violence? This was the most difficult
question I've been asked. But it was not the first time
I've been humbled by a student's question. I've been teaching
in the public schools for 33 years, so I know you have to admit
what you don't know before you can share what you do know. In fact, there's a method
to being an engaged student, teacher, citizen. First, listen closely
to the person asking you a question. Second, admit your vulnerability.
Admit what you don't know. Third, do your homework. Fourth, humbly share your knowledge. I know all about this process. My students ask really
thoughtful questions all the time. They're eager to learn, and sometimes they're eager
to prove their smarts. And believe me, they know
when I have no idea of the answer, so in those instances, I say to them, "That's a great question.
Let me research that and get back to you." So when my students asked, "How do we stop this senseless violence?" I listened, and then I admitted, "I don't know." And like I always do when I don't know
the answer to one of my questions, I began doing my homework. And as a history teacher, I knew I needed to start
with the Second Amendment and the NRA. In case it's been a while since
you've been sitting in a history class, here is what the Second Amendment actually says: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary
to the security of a free State, the right of the people
to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Meaning, the federal government could not
infringe on the rights of citizens to participate in well-regulated militias. The Second Amendment
was ratified 226 years ago. It was written in a time before
the federal government's armed forces were among the most powerful in the world and when state militias were viewed
as necessary to protect the states. Fast-forward 80 years, to 1871. The American Civil War
had ended a few years prior, but a couple of Union officers had witnessed some pretty shoddy
marksmanship on the battlefield. So in an attempt to prepare their men
for any future conflicts, they founded the National
Rifle Association to promote rifle practice. In short, the Second Amendment
was written to ensure that our newly formed and fragile country had access to organized state militias. And the NRA's original mission was
to ensure future soldiers had good aim. Someone could teach an entire course on how the next 150 years influenced
the gun regulation conversations we're having in the United States and our interpretation
of the Second Amendment. Almost every pivotal moment
in our nation's history in one way or another influenced how we as a people manufacture, debate,
regulate and feel about guns. A lot of change has occurred. As a matter of fact, it wasn't until 2008 that the Supreme Court
ruled for the first time the Second Amendment protects
an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm
for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Within the home. This change over time is striking to me, because it reminds us that the interpretation
of the Second Amendment and cultural attitudes about guns have changed over time. Which gives me hope
they could change again. (Applause) It's an incredibly complex
and dynamic history lesson, but it's not the lesson
I'm here to teach today, because we don't have time. I'm not talking about time, the time that I have here
to stand and speak. I'm talking about the fact
we don't have time to lose. According to the CDC, over the last five years, on average, each day 96 people
are killed by guns in the United States, and if we don't figure out how to answer
my students' question soon, one of us could be next. So, if the question is,
how do we stop this senseless violence, the best way I can think to answer is to look at multiple choice. You remember multiple-choice
questions in high school, don't you? Let's start. Choice A: this will end when we
hold gun manufacturers responsible for the deadliness of their products. It might surprise you to learn that we've
actually thought about this before. Between 1998 and 2000, 30 counties and cities
sued gun manufacturers, saying they should
make their products safer and do a better job of tracking
where their products are sold. In response, manufacturers argued that they had no direct liability
for how their products were used. They said the stores who sold the guns
and the owners who bought them were responsible
should anything bad happen. In response to this
and many other lawsuits, the NRA lobbied
for the passage of the PLCAA, the Protection of Lawful
Commerce in Arms Act. The PLCAA passed
with bipartisan support in 2005 and entrusts gun manufacturers to design guns safely, stores to sell those guns responsibly and someone to own
and use the gun responsibly. And so when 17 students
and faculty die at my school, no one in this chain
will assume responsibility. Let's take a look at another option, Choice B: this will end when we
hold ourselves accountable and regulate the estimated
300 million guns available in America. Yes, voting is one of the best ways to take personal responsibility
for gun violence. Making sure that our lawmakers
are willing to pass commonsense gun reform is one of the most effective ways to get
those 300 million guns under control. And also, gun owners
can take personal initiative. If you own a gun, ask yourself: Do I have an extra gun I don't need? Could it fall into the wrong hands? Have I attended the latest training? Perhaps as a gun owner, you should also ask whether you have been
taking care of your mental health? When it comes to gun violence,
the mental health argument falls flat if we don't acknowledge
our own personal vulnerabilities to mental illness. One in six Americans
will struggle with mental illness. If we own a gun, we should be
rigorously engaged in the upkeep of our emotional well-being so we don't pull a trigger in times of illness. Otherwise, we should
seriously ask ourselves whether we really have the time
and attention to own a gun. Perhaps for some of us it's time to lay down our arms. Then we have Choice C: this will end when we do a better job
of taking care of each other. Many social issues affect
why people buy and use guns. Sixty-two percent of US gun fatalities between 2012 and 2016 were suicides, yet we call people maniacs
and psychos, shaming them. We are creating barriers
for people that need help. Why are we embarrassing each other? Let's make it easier, not harder, for people to access
better mental health care. What else? Sexism, racism
and poverty affect gun ownership and gun-related fatalities. On average, it's estimated that 50 women
were fatally shot each month between 2010 and 2014 due to domestic violence, and women are still dying in their homes. Let's empower women and give our young boys a chance to learn how to work out their conflicts
and emotions with words, not weapons. And the "Washington Post"
reported that last year, nearly 1,000 people were fatally wounded by on-duty police officers. Talk to Black Lives Matter
and the police union about that. We need to tackle this. (Applause) At the end of the day, perhaps people won't feel the need to buy and use a gun when they all equally feel safe, healthy, respected and cared for. All right, discussion time is over. It's now time to answer the question. How do we stop this senseless violence? Is it Choice A, Choice B, Choice C? Now, I know what you're all thinking. You remember that
multiple-choice questions almost never end
with just three possibilities. There's always that fourth,
Choice D: all of the above. Maybe that's the answer here. Or maybe "all of the above" is too easy,
and this is not an easy problem. It requires deep analytical
thinking by all of us. So instead, I'm asking you
to do your homework, write your own Choice D using supporting detail. And if you're not sure where to start,
look to my students as role models. They are armed with incredible
communication skills and a sense of citizenship
that I find so inspiring. (Applause) These are public school kids
engaged in the issue of gun regulation, and their endeavor has moved our hearts. And they shouldn't have
to do this on their own. They're asking you, they're asking all of us, to get involved. This isn't a spectator sport. So what's the right answer? I don't know. Listen,
I'm no gun control expert. I teach the humanities. To be human is to learn, and to be part of a civilization
is to share your knowledge. This kind of honest,
brave and sincere engagement is what I ask of my students, what I expect of myself as a teacher and what I demand of you now. Every one of you
needs to do your homework. And then what? Humbly share your knowledge
with each other. Please teach your family, teach your community, your city council, your state legislature. Teach Congress a lesson. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of content and intent. However, it does not match the ground truth MCQ.

A more relevant question is Question 6, but it also does not match the ground truth MCQ. 

However, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the "Protection for Lawful Commerce Act" or the Supreme Court passing an act in 2005.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would say that none of the questions directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic.

Generated MCQ 1 is related to the Second Amendment, and Generated MCQ 6 is related to the relationship between the Second Amendment, gun violence, and societal factors. However, neither of these questions directly matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that there is no direct match, but the closest related question would be Generated MCQ 6, with the understanding that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: 6 (with the caveat that it's not a direct match)

I've been humbled by a student's question. I've been teaching
in the public schools for 33 years, so I know you have to admit
what you don't know before you can share what you do know. In fact, there's a method
to being an engaged student, teacher, citizen. First, listen closely
to the person asking you a question. Second, admit your vulnerability.
Admit what you don't know. Third, do your homework. Fourth, humbly share your knowledge. I know all about this process. My students ask really
thoughtful questions all the time. They're eager to learn, and sometimes they're eager
to prove their smarts. And believe me, they know
when I have no idea of the answer, so in those instances, I say to them, "That's a great question.
Let me research that and get back to you." So when my students asked, "How do we stop this senseless violence?" I listened, and then I admitted, "I don't know." And like I always do when I don't know
the answer to one of my questions, I began doing my homework. And as a history teacher, I knew I needed to start
with the Second Amendment and the NRA. In case it's been a while since
you've been sitting in a history class, here is what the Second Amendment actually says: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary
to the security of a free State, the right of the people
to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Meaning, the federal government could not
infringe on the rights of citizens to participate in well-regulated militias. The Second Amendment
was ratified 226 years ago. It was written in a time before
the federal government's armed forces were among the most powerful in the world and when state militias were viewed
as necessary to protect the states. Fast-forward 80 years, to 1871. The American Civil War
had ended a few years prior, but a couple of Union officers had witnessed some pretty shoddy
marksmanship on the battlefield. So in an attempt to prepare their men
for any future conflicts, they founded the National
Rifle Association to promote rifle practice. In short, the Second Amendment
was written to ensure that our newly formed and fragile country had access to organized state militias. And the NRA's original mission was
to ensure future soldiers had good aim. Someone could teach an entire course on how the next 150 years influenced
the gun regulation conversations we're having in the United States and our interpretation
of the Second Amendment. Almost every pivotal moment
in our nation's history in one way or another influenced how we as a people manufacture, debate,
regulate and feel about guns. A lot of change has occurred. As a matter of fact, it wasn't until 2008 that the Supreme Court
ruled for the first time the Second Amendment protects
an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm
for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Within the home. This change over time is striking to me, because it reminds us that the interpretation
of the Second Amendment and cultural attitudes about guns have changed over time. Which gives me hope
they could change again. (Applause) It's an incredibly complex
and dynamic history lesson, but it's not the lesson
I'm here to teach today, because we don't have time. I'm not talking about time, the time that I have here
to stand and speak. I'm talking about the fact
we don't have time to lose. According to the CDC, over the last five years, on average, each day 96 people
are killed by guns in the United States, and if we don't figure out how to answer
my students' question soon, one of us could be next. So, if the question is,
how do we stop this senseless violence, the best way I can think to answer is to look at multiple choice. You remember multiple-choice
questions in high school, don't you? Let's start. Choice A: this will end when we
hold gun manufacturers responsible for the deadliness of their products. It might surprise you to learn that we've
actually thought about this before. Between 1998 and 2000, 30 counties and cities
sued gun manufacturers, saying they should
make their products safer and do a better job of tracking
where their products are sold. In response, manufacturers argued that they had no direct liability
for how their products were used. They said the stores who sold the guns
and the owners who bought them were responsible
should anything bad happen. In response to this
and many other lawsuits, the NRA lobbied
for the passage of the PLCAA, the Protection of Lawful
Commerce in Arms Act. The PLCAA passed
with bipartisan support in 2005 and entrusts gun manufacturers to design guns safely, stores to sell those guns responsibly and someone to own
and use the gun responsibly. And so when 17 students
and faculty die at my school, no one in this chain
will assume responsibility. Let's take a look at another option, Choice B: this will end when we
hold ourselves accountable and regulate the estimated
300 million guns available in America. Yes, voting is one of the best ways to take personal responsibility
for gun violence. Making sure that our lawmakers
are willing to pass commonsense gun reform is one of the most effective ways to get
those 300 million guns under control. And also, gun owners
can take personal initiative. If you own a gun, ask yourself: Do I have an extra gun I don't need? Could it fall into the wrong hands? Have I attended the latest training? Perhaps as a gun owner, you should also ask whether you have been
taking care of your mental health? When it comes to gun violence,
the mental health argument falls flat if we don't acknowledge
our own personal vulnerabilities to mental illness. One in six Americans
will struggle with mental illness. If we own a gun, we should be
rigorously engaged in the upkeep of our emotional well-being so we don't pull a trigger in times of illness. Otherwise, we should
seriously ask ourselves whether we really have the time
and attention to own a gun. Perhaps for some of us it's time to lay down our arms. Then we have Choice C: this will end when we do a better job
of taking care of each other. Many social issues affect
why people buy and use guns. Sixty-two percent of US gun fatalities between 2012 and 2016 were suicides, yet we call people maniacs
and psychos, shaming them. We are creating barriers
for people that need help. Why are we embarrassing each other? Let's make it easier, not harder, for people to access
better mental health care. What else? Sexism, racism
and poverty affect gun ownership and gun-related fatalities. On average, it's estimated that 50 women
were fatally shot each month between 2010 and 2014 due to domestic violence, and women are still dying in their homes. Let's empower women and give our young boys a chance to learn how to work out their conflicts
and emotions with words, not weapons. And the "Washington Post"
reported that last year, nearly 1,000 people were fatally wounded by on-duty police officers. Talk to Black Lives Matter
and the police union about that. We need to tackle this. (Applause) At the end of the day, perhaps people won't feel the need to buy and use a gun when they all equally feel safe, healthy, respected and cared for. All right, discussion time is over. It's now time to answer the question. How do we stop this senseless violence? Is it Choice A, Choice B, Choice C? Now, I know what you're all thinking. You remember that
multiple-choice questions almost never end
with just three possibilities. There's always that fourth,
Choice D: all of the above. Maybe that's the answer here. Or maybe "all of the above" is too easy,
and this is not an easy problem. It requires deep analytical
thinking by all of us. So instead, I'm asking you
to do your homework, write your own Choice D using supporting detail. And if you're not sure where to start,
look to my students as role models. They are armed with incredible
communication skills and a sense of citizenship
that I find so inspiring. (Applause) These are public school kids
engaged in the issue of gun regulation, and their endeavor has moved our hearts. And they shouldn't have
to do this on their own. They're asking you, they're asking all of us, to get involved. This isn't a spectator sport. So what's the right answer? I don't know. Listen,
I'm no gun control expert. I teach the humanities. To be human is to learn, and to be part of a civilization
is to share your knowledge. This kind of honest,
brave and sincere engagement is what I ask of my students, what I expect of myself as a teacher and what I demand of you now. Every one of you
needs to do your homework. And then what? Humbly share your knowledge
with each other. Please teach your family, teach your community, your city council, your state legislature. Teach Congress a lesson. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I grew up with my identical twin, who was an incredibly loving brother. Now, one thing about being a twin is, it makes you an expert
at spotting favoritism. If his cookie was even
slightly bigger than my cookie, I had questions. And clearly, I wasn't starving. (Laughter) When I became a psychologist,
I began to notice favoritism of a different kind; and that is, how much more we value
the body than we do the mind. I spent nine years at university
earning my doctorate in psychology, and I can't tell you how many people
look at my business card and say, "Oh -- a psychologist.
So, not a real doctor," as if it should say that on my card. [Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist
(Not a Real Doctor)] (Laughter) This favoritism we show the body
over the mind -- I see it everywhere. I recently was at a friend's house, and their five-year-old
was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool
by the sink, brushing his teeth, when he slipped and scratched his leg
on the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute,
but then he got back up, got back on the stool, and reached out
for a box of Band-Aids to put one on his cut. Now, this kid could barely
tie his shoelaces, but he knew you have to cover a cut
so it doesn't become infected, and you have to care for your teeth
by brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain
our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene, right? We've known it since
we were five years old. But what do we know about maintaining
our psychological health? Well, nothing. What do we teach our children
about emotional hygiene? Nothing. How is it that we spend more time
taking care of our teeth than we do our minds? Why is it that our physical health
is so much more important to us than our psychological health? We sustain psychological injuries
even more often than we do physical ones, injuries like failure
or rejection or loneliness. And they can also get worse
if we ignore them, and they can impact our lives
in dramatic ways. And yet, even though there are
scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these
kinds of psychological injuries, we don't. It doesn't even occur to us
that we should. "Oh, you're feeling depressed?
Just shake it off; it's all in your head." Can you imagine saying that
to somebody with a broken leg: "Oh, just walk it off;
it's all in your leg." (Laughter) It is time we closed the gap between our physical
and our psychological health. It's time we made them more equal, more like twins. Speaking of which,
my brother is also a psychologist. So he's not a real doctor, either. (Laughter) We didn't study together, though. In fact, the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic
to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology. We were apart then
for the first time in our lives, and the separation was brutal
for both of us. But while he remained
among family and friends, I was alone in a new country. We missed each other terribly, but international phone calls
were really expensive then, and we could only afford to speak
for five minutes a week. When our birthday rolled around, it was the first
we wouldn't be spending together. We decided to splurge, and that week,
we would talk for 10 minutes. (Laughter) I spent the morning pacing around my room,
waiting for him to call -- and waiting ... and waiting. But the phone didn't ring. Given the time difference, I assumed, "OK, he's out with friends,
he'll call later." There were no cell phones then. But he didn't. And I began to realize
that after being away for over 10 months, he no longer missed me
the way I missed him. I knew he would call in the morning, but that night was one of the saddest
and longest nights of my life. I woke up the next morning. I glanced down at the phone, and I realized
I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before. I stumbled out of bed, I put the phone back on the receiver,
and it rang a second later. And it was my brother, and boy, was he pissed. (Laughter) It was the saddest and longest
night of his life as well. Now, I tried to explain
what happened, but he said, "I don't understand. If you saw I wasn't calling you, why didn't you just pick up
the phone and call me?" He was right. Why didn't I call him? I didn't have an answer then. But I do today, and it's a simple one: loneliness. Loneliness creates a deep
psychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions
and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us
care much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out, because why set yourself up
for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching
more than you can stand? I was in the grips
of real loneliness back then, but I was surrounded by people all day,
so it never occurred to me. But loneliness is defined
purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel
emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you. And I did. There is a lot of research on loneliness,
and all of it is horrifying. Loneliness won't just make you miserable; it will kill you. I'm not kidding. Chronic loneliness increases
your likelihood of an early death by 14 percent. Fourteen percent! Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning
of your immune system, making you vulnerable to all kinds
of illnesses and diseases. In fact, scientists have concluded
that taken together, chronic loneliness
poses as significant a risk for your long-term health and longevity as cigarette smoking. Now, cigarette packs come with warnings
saying, "This could kill you." But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize
our psychological health, that we practice emotional hygiene. Because you can't treat
a psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured. Loneliness isn't the only
psychological wound that distorts our perceptions
and misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center, where I saw three toddlers
play with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling
the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back
and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her
watched this happen, then turned to his box and burst
into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight. So: three toddlers
with identical plastic toys, but with very different
reactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented
them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them
into believing they could not. Now, adults get tricked this way
as well, all the time. In fact, we all have a default set
of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever
we encounter frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how
your mind reacts to failure? You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you
you're incapable of something, and you believe it, then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon,
or you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more
convinced you can't succeed. You see, that's why so many people
function below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way,
sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't
succeed, and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something,
it's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way
when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends
down a dark road at night, when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area
and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car,
and shined his flashlight on the driver, then on my brother in the front seat, and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said, "Where have I seen your face before?" (Laughter) And I said, "In the front seat." (Laughter) But that made no sense to him whatsoever, so now he thought I was on drugs. (Laughter) So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me, he marches me over to the police car, and only when he verified
I didn't have a police record, could I show him
I had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away, you could see by the look
on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. (Laughter) Our mind is hard to change
once we become convinced. So it might be very natural
to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself
to become convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight
feelings of helplessness. You have to gain control
over the situation. And you have to break
this kind of negative cycle before it begins. [Stop Emotional Bleeding] Our minds and our feelings -- they're not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were. They're more like a really moody friend, who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman
who, after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online, and he seemed nice
and he seemed successful, and most importantly,
he seemed really into her. So she was very excited,
she bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date,
the man stands up and says, "I'm not interested," and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said:
"Well, what do you expect? You have big hips,
you have nothing interesting to say. Why would a handsome,
successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you?" Shocking, right, that a friend
could be so cruel? But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't
the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do, especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults
and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were,
what we wish we weren't. We call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do, because our self-esteem
is already hurting. Why would we want to go
and damage it even further? We wouldn't make a physical injury
worse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm
and decide, "Oh! I know -- I'm going to take a knife and see
how much deeper I can make it." But we do that with psychological
injuries all the time. Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize
our psychological health. We know from dozens of studies
that when your self-esteem is lower, you are more vulnerable
to stress and to anxiety; that failures and rejections hurt more, and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected,
the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self-esteem, not join Fight Club
and beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain, treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend. [Protect Your Self-Esteem] We have to catch our unhealthy
psychological habits and change them. And one of unhealthiest and most common
is called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you or your professor
makes you feel stupid in class, or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying
the scene in your head for days, sometimes for weeks on end. Now, ruminating about upsetting events
in this way can easily become a habit, and it's a very costly one, because by spending so much time focused
on upsetting and negative thoughts, you are actually putting yourself
at significant risk for developing clinical depression, alcoholism, eating disorders, and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is, the urge to ruminate can feel
really strong and really important, so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact, because a little over a year ago,
I developed the habit myself. You see, my twin brother was diagnosed
with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremely aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course
of chemotherapy. And I couldn't stop thinking
about what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking
about how much he was suffering, even though he never complained, not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy,
but psychologically, I was a mess. But I knew what to do. Studies tell us that even a two-minute
distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate
in that moment. And so each time I had a worrying,
upsetting, negative thought, I forced myself to concentrate
on something else until the urge passed. And within one week,
my whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful. [Battle Negative Thinking] Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
my brother had a CAT scan, and I was by his side
when he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds
of chemotherapy to go, but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely, by changing your responses to failure, by protecting your self-esteem, by battling negative thinking, you won't just heal
your psychological wounds, you will build emotional resilience, you will thrive. A hundred years ago, people began
practicing personal hygiene, and life expectancy rates
rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life
could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing
emotional hygiene. Can you imagine
what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier? If there were less loneliness
and less depression? If people knew how to overcome failure? If they felt better about themselves
and more empowered? If they were happier and more fulfilled? I can, because that's the world
I want to live in. And that's the world
my brother wants to live in as well. And if you just become informed
and change a few simple habits, well -- that's the world we can all live in. Thank you very much. (Applause)

slightly bigger than my cookie, I had questions. And clearly, I wasn't starving. (Laughter) When I became a psychologist,
I began to notice favoritism of a different kind; and that is, how much more we value
the body than we do the mind. I spent nine years at university
earning my doctorate in psychology, and I can't tell you how many people
look at my business card and say, "Oh -- a psychologist.
So, not a real doctor," as if it should say that on my card. [Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist
(Not a Real Doctor)] (Laughter) This favoritism we show the body
over the mind -- I see it everywhere. I recently was at a friend's house, and their five-year-old
was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool
by the sink, brushing his teeth, when he slipped and scratched his leg
on the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute,
but then he got back up, got back on the stool, and reached out
for a box of Band-Aids to put one on his cut. Now, this kid could barely
tie his shoelaces, but he knew you have to cover a cut
so it doesn't become infected, and you have to care for your teeth
by brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain
our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene, right? We've known it since
we were five years old. But what do we know about maintaining
our psychological health? Well, nothing. What do we teach our children
about emotional hygiene? Nothing. How is it that we spend more time
taking care of our teeth than we do our minds? Why is it that our physical health
is so much more important to us than our psychological health? We sustain psychological injuries
even more often than we do physical ones, injuries like failure
or rejection or loneliness. And they can also get worse
if we ignore them, and they can impact our lives
in dramatic ways. And yet, even though there are
scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these
kinds of psychological injuries, we don't. It doesn't even occur to us
that we should. "Oh, you're feeling depressed?
Just shake it off; it's all in your head." Can you imagine saying that
to somebody with a broken leg: "Oh, just walk it off;
it's all in your leg." (Laughter) It is time we closed the gap between our physical
and our psychological health. It's time we made them more equal, more like twins. Speaking of which,
my brother is also a psychologist. So he's not a real doctor, either. (Laughter) We didn't study together, though. In fact, the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic
to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology. We were apart then
for the first time in our lives, and the separation was brutal
for both of us. But while he remained
among family and friends, I was alone in a new country. We missed each other terribly, but international phone calls
were really expensive then, and we could only afford to speak
for five minutes a week. When our birthday rolled around, it was the first
we wouldn't be spending together. We decided to splurge, and that week,
we would talk for 10 minutes. (Laughter) I spent the morning pacing around my room,
waiting for him to call -- and waiting ... and waiting. But the phone didn't ring. Given the time difference, I assumed, "OK, he's out with friends,
he'll call later." There were no cell phones then. But he didn't. And I began to realize
that after being away for over 10 months, he no longer missed me
the way I missed him. I knew he would call in the morning, but that night was one of the saddest
and longest nights of my life. I woke up the next morning. I glanced down at the phone, and I realized
I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before. I stumbled out of bed, I put the phone back on the receiver,
and it rang a second later. And it was my brother, and boy, was he pissed. (Laughter) It was the saddest and longest
night of his life as well. Now, I tried to explain
what happened, but he said, "I don't understand. If you saw I wasn't calling you, why didn't you just pick up
the phone and call me?" He was right. Why didn't I call him? I didn't have an answer then. But I do today, and it's a simple one: loneliness. Loneliness creates a deep
psychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions
and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us
care much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out, because why set yourself up
for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching
more than you can stand? I was in the grips
of real loneliness back then, but I was surrounded by people all day,
so it never occurred to me. But loneliness is defined
purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel
emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you. And I did. There is a lot of research on loneliness,
and all of it is horrifying. Loneliness won't just make you miserable; it will kill you. I'm not kidding. Chronic loneliness increases
your likelihood of an early death by 14 percent. Fourteen percent! Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning
of your immune system, making you vulnerable to all kinds
of illnesses and diseases. In fact, scientists have concluded
that taken together, chronic loneliness
poses as significant a risk for your long-term health and longevity as cigarette smoking. Now, cigarette packs come with warnings
saying, "This could kill you." But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize
our psychological health, that we practice emotional hygiene. Because you can't treat
a psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured. Loneliness isn't the only
psychological wound that distorts our perceptions
and misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center, where I saw three toddlers
play with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling
the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back
and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her
watched this happen, then turned to his box and burst
into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight. So: three toddlers
with identical plastic toys, but with very different
reactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented
them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them
into believing they could not. Now, adults get tricked this way
as well, all the time. In fact, we all have a default set
of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever
we encounter frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how
your mind reacts to failure? You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you
you're incapable of something, and you believe it, then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon,
or you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more
convinced you can't succeed. You see, that's why so many people
function below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way,
sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't
succeed, and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something,
it's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way
when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends
down a dark road at night, when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area
and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car,
and shined his flashlight on the driver, then on my brother in the front seat, and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said, "Where have I seen your face before?" (Laughter) And I said, "In the front seat." (Laughter) But that made no sense to him whatsoever, so now he thought I was on drugs. (Laughter) So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me, he marches me over to the police car, and only when he verified
I didn't have a police record, could I show him
I had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away, you could see by the look
on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. (Laughter) Our mind is hard to change
once we become convinced. So it might be very natural
to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself
to become convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight
feelings of helplessness. You have to gain control
over the situation. And you have to break
this kind of negative cycle before it begins. [Stop Emotional Bleeding] Our minds and our feelings -- they're not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were. They're more like a really moody friend, who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman
who, after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online, and he seemed nice
and he seemed successful, and most importantly,
he seemed really into her. So she was very excited,
she bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date,
the man stands up and says, "I'm not interested," and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said:
"Well, what do you expect? You have big hips,
you have nothing interesting to say. Why would a handsome,
successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you?" Shocking, right, that a friend
could be so cruel? But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't
the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do, especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults
and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were,
what we wish we weren't. We call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do, because our self-esteem
is already hurting. Why would we want to go
and damage it even further? We wouldn't make a physical injury
worse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm
and decide, "Oh! I know -- I'm going to take a knife and see
how much deeper I can make it." But we do that with psychological
injuries all the time. Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize
our psychological health. We know from dozens of studies
that when your self-esteem is lower, you are more vulnerable
to stress and to anxiety; that failures and rejections hurt more, and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected,
the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self-esteem, not join Fight Club
and beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain, treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend. [Protect Your Self-Esteem] We have to catch our unhealthy
psychological habits and change them. And one of unhealthiest and most common
is called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you or your professor
makes you feel stupid in class, or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying
the scene in your head for days, sometimes for weeks on end. Now, ruminating about upsetting events
in this way can easily become a habit, and it's a very costly one, because by spending so much time focused
on upsetting and negative thoughts, you are actually putting yourself
at significant risk for developing clinical depression, alcoholism, eating disorders, and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is, the urge to ruminate can feel
really strong and really important, so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact, because a little over a year ago,
I developed the habit myself. You see, my twin brother was diagnosed
with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremely aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course
of chemotherapy. And I couldn't stop thinking
about what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking
about how much he was suffering, even though he never complained, not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy,
but psychologically, I was a mess. But I knew what to do. Studies tell us that even a two-minute
distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate
in that moment. And so each time I had a worrying,
upsetting, negative thought, I forced myself to concentrate
on something else until the urge passed. And within one week,
my whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful. [Battle Negative Thinking] Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
my brother had a CAT scan, and I was by his side
when he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds
of chemotherapy to go, but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely, by changing your responses to failure, by protecting your self-esteem, by battling negative thinking, you won't just heal
your psychological wounds, you will build emotional resilience, you will thrive. A hundred years ago, people began
practicing personal hygiene, and life expectancy rates
rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life
could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing
emotional hygiene. Can you imagine
what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier? If there were less loneliness
and less depression? If people knew how to overcome failure? If they felt better about themselves
and more empowered? If they were happier and more fulfilled? I can, because that's the world
I want to live in. And that's the world
my brother wants to live in as well. And if you just become informed
and change a few simple habits, well -- that's the world we can all live in. Thank you very much. (Applause)

(Not a Real Doctor)] (Laughter) This favoritism we show the body
over the mind -- I see it everywhere. I recently was at a friend's house, and their five-year-old
was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool
by the sink, brushing his teeth, when he slipped and scratched his leg
on the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute,

psychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions
and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us
care much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out, because why set yourself up
for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching
more than you can stand? I was in the grips

purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel
emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you. And I did. There is a lot of research on loneliness,
and all of it is horrifying. Loneliness won't just make you miserable; it will kill you. I'm not kidding. Chronic loneliness increases
your likelihood of an early death by 14 percent. Fourteen percent! Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning
of your immune system, making you vulnerable to all kinds
of illnesses and diseases. In fact, scientists have concluded
that taken together, chronic loneliness
poses as significant a risk for your long-term health and longevity as cigarette smoking. Now, cigarette packs come with warnings
saying, "This could kill you." But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize
our psychological health, that we practice emotional hygiene. Because you can't treat
a psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured. Loneliness isn't the only
psychological wound that distorts our perceptions
and misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center, where I saw three toddlers
play with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling
the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back
and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her
watched this happen, then turned to his box and burst
into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight. So: three toddlers
with identical plastic toys, but with very different
reactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented
them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them
into believing they could not. Now, adults get tricked this way
as well, all the time. In fact, we all have a default set
of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever
we encounter frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how
your mind reacts to failure? You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you
you're incapable of something, and you believe it, then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon,
or you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more
convinced you can't succeed. You see, that's why so many people
function below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way,
sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't
succeed, and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something,
it's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way
when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends
down a dark road at night, when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area
and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car,
and shined his flashlight on the driver, then on my brother in the front seat, and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said, "Where have I seen your face before?" (Laughter) And I said, "In the front seat." (Laughter) But that made no sense to him whatsoever, so now he thought I was on drugs. (Laughter) So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me, he marches me over to the police car, and only when he verified
I didn't have a police record, could I show him
I had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away, you could see by the look
on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. (Laughter) Our mind is hard to change
once we become convinced. So it might be very natural
to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself
to become convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight
feelings of helplessness. You have to gain control
over the situation. And you have to break
this kind of negative cycle before it begins. [Stop Emotional Bleeding] Our minds and our feelings -- they're not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were. They're more like a really moody friend, who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman
who, after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online, and he seemed nice
and he seemed successful, and most importantly,
he seemed really into her. So she was very excited,
she bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date,
the man stands up and says, "I'm not interested," and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said:
"Well, what do you expect? You have big hips,
you have nothing interesting to say. Why would a handsome,
successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you?" Shocking, right, that a friend
could be so cruel? But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't
the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do, especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults
and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were,
what we wish we weren't. We call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do, because our self-esteem
is already hurting. Why would we want to go
and damage it even further? We wouldn't make a physical injury
worse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm
and decide, "Oh! I know -- I'm going to take a knife and see
how much deeper I can make it." But we do that with psychological
injuries all the time. Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize
our psychological health. We know from dozens of studies
that when your self-esteem is lower, you are more vulnerable
to stress and to anxiety; that failures and rejections hurt more, and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected,
the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self-esteem, not join Fight Club
and beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain, treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend. [Protect Your Self-Esteem] We have to catch our unhealthy
psychological habits and change them. And one of unhealthiest and most common
is called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you or your professor
makes you feel stupid in class, or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying
the scene in your head for days, sometimes for weeks on end. Now, ruminating about upsetting events
in this way can easily become a habit, and it's a very costly one, because by spending so much time focused
on upsetting and negative thoughts, you are actually putting yourself
at significant risk for developing clinical depression, alcoholism, eating disorders, and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is, the urge to ruminate can feel
really strong and really important, so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact, because a little over a year ago,
I developed the habit myself. You see, my twin brother was diagnosed
with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremely aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course
of chemotherapy. And I couldn't stop thinking
about what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking
about how much he was suffering, even though he never complained, not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy,
but psychologically, I was a mess. But I knew what to do. Studies tell us that even a two-minute
distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate
in that moment. And so each time I had a worrying,
upsetting, negative thought, I forced myself to concentrate
on something else until the urge passed. And within one week,
my whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful. [Battle Negative Thinking] Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
my brother had a CAT scan, and I was by his side
when he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds
of chemotherapy to go, but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely, by changing your responses to failure, by protecting your self-esteem, by battling negative thinking, you won't just heal
your psychological wounds, you will build emotional resilience, you will thrive. A hundred years ago, people began
practicing personal hygiene, and life expectancy rates
rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life
could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing
emotional hygiene. Can you imagine
what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier? If there were less loneliness
and less depression? If people knew how to overcome failure? If they felt better about themselves
and more empowered? If they were happier and more fulfilled? I can, because that's the world
I want to live in. And that's the world
my brother wants to live in as well. And if you just become informed
and change a few simple habits, well -- that's the world we can all live in. Thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I grew up with my identical twin, who was an incredibly loving brother. Now, one thing about being a twin is, it makes you an expert
at spotting favoritism. If his cookie was even
slightly bigger than my cookie, I had questions. And clearly, I wasn't starving. (Laughter) When I became a psychologist,
I began to notice favoritism of a different kind; and that is, how much more we value
the body than we do the mind. I spent nine years at university
earning my doctorate in psychology, and I can't tell you how many people
look at my business card and say, "Oh -- a psychologist.
So, not a real doctor," as if it should say that on my card. [Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist
(Not a Real Doctor)] (Laughter) This favoritism we show the body
over the mind -- I see it everywhere. I recently was at a friend's house, and their five-year-old
was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool
by the sink, brushing his teeth, when he slipped and scratched his leg
on the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute,
but then he got back up, got back on the stool, and reached out
for a box of Band-Aids to put one on his cut. Now, this kid could barely
tie his shoelaces, but he knew you have to cover a cut
so it doesn't become infected, and you have to care for your teeth
by brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain
our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene, right? We've known it since
we were five years old. But what do we know about maintaining
our psychological health? Well, nothing. What do we teach our children
about emotional hygiene? Nothing. How is it that we spend more time
taking care of our teeth than we do our minds? Why is it that our physical health
is so much more important to us than our psychological health? We sustain psychological injuries
even more often than we do physical ones, injuries like failure
or rejection or loneliness. And they can also get worse
if we ignore them, and they can impact our lives
in dramatic ways. And yet, even though there are
scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these
kinds of psychological injuries, we don't. It doesn't even occur to us
that we should. "Oh, you're feeling depressed?
Just shake it off; it's all in your head." Can you imagine saying that
to somebody with a broken leg: "Oh, just walk it off;
it's all in your leg." (Laughter) It is time we closed the gap between our physical
and our psychological health. It's time we made them more equal, more like twins. Speaking of which,
my brother is also a psychologist. So he's not a real doctor, either. (Laughter) We didn't study together, though. In fact, the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic
to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology. We were apart then
for the first time in our lives, and the separation was brutal
for both of us. But while he remained
among family and friends, I was alone in a new country. We missed each other terribly, but international phone calls
were really expensive then, and we could only afford to speak
for five minutes a week. When our birthday rolled around, it was the first
we wouldn't be spending together. We decided to splurge, and that week,
we would talk for 10 minutes. (Laughter) I spent the morning pacing around my room,
waiting for him to call -- and waiting ... and waiting. But the phone didn't ring. Given the time difference, I assumed, "OK, he's out with friends,
he'll call later." There were no cell phones then. But he didn't. And I began to realize
that after being away for over 10 months, he no longer missed me
the way I missed him. I knew he would call in the morning, but that night was one of the saddest
and longest nights of my life. I woke up the next morning. I glanced down at the phone, and I realized
I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before. I stumbled out of bed, I put the phone back on the receiver,
and it rang a second later. And it was my brother, and boy, was he pissed. (Laughter) It was the saddest and longest
night of his life as well. Now, I tried to explain
what happened, but he said, "I don't understand. If you saw I wasn't calling you, why didn't you just pick up
the phone and call me?" He was right. Why didn't I call him? I didn't have an answer then. But I do today, and it's a simple one: loneliness. Loneliness creates a deep
psychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions
and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us
care much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out, because why set yourself up
for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching
more than you can stand? I was in the grips
of real loneliness back then, but I was surrounded by people all day,
so it never occurred to me. But loneliness is defined
purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel
emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you. And I did. There is a lot of research on loneliness,
and all of it is horrifying. Loneliness won't just make you miserable; it will kill you. I'm not kidding. Chronic loneliness increases
your likelihood of an early death by 14 percent. Fourteen percent! Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning
of your immune system, making you vulnerable to all kinds
of illnesses and diseases. In fact, scientists have concluded
that taken together, chronic loneliness
poses as significant a risk for your long-term health and longevity as cigarette smoking. Now, cigarette packs come with warnings
saying, "This could kill you." But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize
our psychological health, that we practice emotional hygiene. Because you can't treat
a psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured. Loneliness isn't the only
psychological wound that distorts our perceptions
and misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center, where I saw three toddlers
play with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling
the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back
and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her
watched this happen, then turned to his box and burst
into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight. So: three toddlers
with identical plastic toys, but with very different
reactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented
them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them
into believing they could not. Now, adults get tricked this way
as well, all the time. In fact, we all have a default set
of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever
we encounter frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how
your mind reacts to failure? You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you
you're incapable of something, and you believe it, then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon,
or you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more
convinced you can't succeed. You see, that's why so many people
function below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way,
sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't
succeed, and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something,
it's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way
when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends
down a dark road at night, when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area
and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car,
and shined his flashlight on the driver, then on my brother in the front seat, and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said, "Where have I seen your face before?" (Laughter) And I said, "In the front seat." (Laughter) But that made no sense to him whatsoever, so now he thought I was on drugs. (Laughter) So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me, he marches me over to the police car, and only when he verified
I didn't have a police record, could I show him
I had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away, you could see by the look
on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. (Laughter) Our mind is hard to change
once we become convinced. So it might be very natural
to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself
to become convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight
feelings of helplessness. You have to gain control
over the situation. And you have to break
this kind of negative cycle before it begins. [Stop Emotional Bleeding] Our minds and our feelings -- they're not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were. They're more like a really moody friend, who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman
who, after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online, and he seemed nice
and he seemed successful, and most importantly,
he seemed really into her. So she was very excited,
she bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date,
the man stands up and says, "I'm not interested," and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said:
"Well, what do you expect? You have big hips,
you have nothing interesting to say. Why would a handsome,
successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you?" Shocking, right, that a friend
could be so cruel? But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't
the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do, especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults
and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were,
what we wish we weren't. We call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do, because our self-esteem
is already hurting. Why would we want to go
and damage it even further? We wouldn't make a physical injury
worse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm
and decide, "Oh! I know -- I'm going to take a knife and see
how much deeper I can make it." But we do that with psychological
injuries all the time. Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize
our psychological health. We know from dozens of studies
that when your self-esteem is lower, you are more vulnerable
to stress and to anxiety; that failures and rejections hurt more, and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected,
the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self-esteem, not join Fight Club
and beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain, treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend. [Protect Your Self-Esteem] We have to catch our unhealthy
psychological habits and change them. And one of unhealthiest and most common
is called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you or your professor
makes you feel stupid in class, or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying
the scene in your head for days, sometimes for weeks on end. Now, ruminating about upsetting events
in this way can easily become a habit, and it's a very costly one, because by spending so much time focused
on upsetting and negative thoughts, you are actually putting yourself
at significant risk for developing clinical depression, alcoholism, eating disorders, and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is, the urge to ruminate can feel
really strong and really important, so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact, because a little over a year ago,
I developed the habit myself. You see, my twin brother was diagnosed
with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremely aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course
of chemotherapy. And I couldn't stop thinking
about what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking
about how much he was suffering, even though he never complained, not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy,
but psychologically, I was a mess. But I knew what to do. Studies tell us that even a two-minute
distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate
in that moment. And so each time I had a worrying,
upsetting, negative thought, I forced myself to concentrate
on something else until the urge passed. And within one week,
my whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful. [Battle Negative Thinking] Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
my brother had a CAT scan, and I was by his side
when he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds
of chemotherapy to go, but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely, by changing your responses to failure, by protecting your self-esteem, by battling negative thinking, you won't just heal
your psychological wounds, you will build emotional resilience, you will thrive. A hundred years ago, people began
practicing personal hygiene, and life expectancy rates
rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life
could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing
emotional hygiene. Can you imagine
what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier? If there were less loneliness
and less depression? If people knew how to overcome failure? If they felt better about themselves
and more empowered? If they were happier and more fulfilled? I can, because that's the world
I want to live in. And that's the world
my brother wants to live in as well. And if you just become informed
and change a few simple habits, well -- that's the world we can all live in. Thank you very much. (Applause)

into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight. So: three toddlers
with identical plastic toys, but with very different
reactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented
them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them
into believing they could not. Now, adults get tricked this way
as well, all the time. In fact, we all have a default set
of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever
we encounter frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how
your mind reacts to failure? You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you
you're incapable of something, and you believe it, then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon,
or you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more
convinced you can't succeed. You see, that's why so many people
function below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way,
sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't
succeed, and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something,
it's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way
when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends
down a dark road at night, when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area
and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car,
and shined his flashlight on the driver, then on my brother in the front seat, and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said, "Where have I seen your face before?" (Laughter) And I said, "In the front seat." (Laughter) But that made no sense to him whatsoever, so now he thought I was on drugs. (Laughter) So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me, he marches me over to the police car, and only when he verified
I didn't have a police record, could I show him
I had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away, you could see by the look
on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. (Laughter) Our mind is hard to change
once we become convinced. So it might be very natural
to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself
to become convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight
feelings of helplessness. You have to gain control
over the situation. And you have to break
this kind of negative cycle before it begins. [Stop Emotional Bleeding] Our minds and our feelings -- they're not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were. They're more like a really moody friend, who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman
who, after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online, and he seemed nice
and he seemed successful, and most importantly,
he seemed really into her. So she was very excited,
she bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date,
the man stands up and says, "I'm not interested," and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said:
"Well, what do you expect? You have big hips,
you have nothing interesting to say. Why would a handsome,
successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you?" Shocking, right, that a friend
could be so cruel? But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't
the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do, especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults
and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were,
what we wish we weren't. We call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do, because our self-esteem
is already hurting. Why would we want to go
and damage it even further? We wouldn't make a physical injury
worse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm
and decide, "Oh! I know -- I'm going to take a knife and see
how much deeper I can make it." But we do that with psychological
injuries all the time. Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize
our psychological health. We know from dozens of studies
that when your self-esteem is lower, you are more vulnerable
to stress and to anxiety; that failures and rejections hurt more, and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected,
the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self-esteem, not join Fight Club
and beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain, treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend. [Protect Your Self-Esteem] We have to catch our unhealthy
psychological habits and change them. And one of unhealthiest and most common
is called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you or your professor
makes you feel stupid in class, or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying
the scene in your head for days, sometimes for weeks on end. Now, ruminating about upsetting events
in this way can easily become a habit, and it's a very costly one, because by spending so much time focused
on upsetting and negative thoughts, you are actually putting yourself
at significant risk for developing clinical depression, alcoholism, eating disorders, and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is, the urge to ruminate can feel
really strong and really important, so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact, because a little over a year ago,
I developed the habit myself. You see, my twin brother was diagnosed
with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremely aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course
of chemotherapy. And I couldn't stop thinking
about what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking
about how much he was suffering, even though he never complained, not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy,
but psychologically, I was a mess. But I knew what to do. Studies tell us that even a two-minute
distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate
in that moment. And so each time I had a worrying,
upsetting, negative thought, I forced myself to concentrate
on something else until the urge passed. And within one week,
my whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful. [Battle Negative Thinking] Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
my brother had a CAT scan, and I was by his side
when he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds
of chemotherapy to go, but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely, by changing your responses to failure, by protecting your self-esteem, by battling negative thinking, you won't just heal
your psychological wounds, you will build emotional resilience, you will thrive. A hundred years ago, people began
practicing personal hygiene, and life expectancy rates
rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life
could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing
emotional hygiene. Can you imagine
what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier? If there were less loneliness
and less depression? If people knew how to overcome failure? If they felt better about themselves
and more empowered? If they were happier and more fulfilled? I can, because that's the world
I want to live in. And that's the world
my brother wants to live in as well. And if you just become informed
and change a few simple habits, well -- that's the world we can all live in. Thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress. For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however,
told a very different story. My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win. But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart
in a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement
from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal
snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest
races in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy
an Indian girl was running. But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers
that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating. Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk
about the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story
of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time
in my entire life that I had done something
that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect. And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate
towards careers and professions that they know
they're going to be great in, that they know they're
going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught
to avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars
and then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise
or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated
to take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously
unless you've had two failed start-ups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave. Some people worry
about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society,
we're just losing out because we're not raising
our girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why
women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look. In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders
handled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls
were quick to give up. The higher the IQ,
the more likely they were to give up. Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material
to be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely
to redouble their efforts. What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys
in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys
and girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found
that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent
of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent
of the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked
as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized
to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. (Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take
less risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs
that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy
is being left behind on all the innovation and problems
women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. (Applause) So in 2012, I started a company
to teach girls to code, and what I found
is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process
of trial and error, of trying to get the right command
in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference
between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying
to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher
tells me the same story. During the first week,
when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over
and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write." The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better,
she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes
just staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student
wrote code and then deleted it. She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing
the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust. It turns out that our girls
are really good at coding, but it's not enough
just to teach them to code. My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours
with computer science students. When the guys are struggling
with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with my code." The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with me." We have to begin to undo
the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it
with building a sisterhood that lets girls know
that they are not alone. Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me, "I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network
cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. Take, for instance,
two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love
for her new country by building an app
to help Americans get to the polls. Or a 16-year-old girl
who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer
is benign or malignant in the off chance
that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just
three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been
socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying,
who have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams. And those dreams have never been
more important for our country. For the American economy,
for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind
half our population. We have to socialize our girls
to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them
to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. We have to teach them
to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential
to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them
that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you
to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece,
your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach
girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement
of young women who are brave and who will build
a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have.
You have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls
are involved now in your program? Reshma Saujani: Yeah.
So in 2012, we taught 20 girls. This year we'll teach 40,000
in all 50 states. (Applause) And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated
7,500 women in computer science. Like, the problem is so bad that we can make
that type of change quickly. CA: And you're working with some
of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming
graduates from your program? RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. And if you're not signed up,
I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code
classroom in their office. CA: And you have some stories
back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams,
good things happen. RS: Great things happen. I mean, I think that it's crazy to me
to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all
consumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate
of 600 percent more than men. We own the Internet, and we should be building
the companies of tomorrow. And I think when companies
have diverse teams, and they have incredible women
that are part of their engineering teams, they build awesome things,
and we see it every day. CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.
You're doing incredibly important work. This whole community is cheering you on.
More power to you. Thank you. RS: Thank you. (Applause)

as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized
to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. (Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take
less risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs
that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy
is being left behind on all the innovation and problems
women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. (Applause) So in 2012, I started a company
to teach girls to code, and what I found
is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process
of trial and error, of trying to get the right command
in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference
between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying
to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher
tells me the same story. During the first week,
when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over
and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write." The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better,
she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes
just staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student
wrote code and then deleted it. She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing
the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust. It turns out that our girls
are really good at coding, but it's not enough
just to teach them to code. My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours
with computer science students. When the guys are struggling
with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with my code." The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with me." We have to begin to undo
the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it
with building a sisterhood that lets girls know
that they are not alone. Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me, "I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network
cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. Take, for instance,
two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love
for her new country by building an app
to help Americans get to the polls. Or a 16-year-old girl
who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer
is benign or malignant in the off chance
that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just
three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been
socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying,
who have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams. And those dreams have never been
more important for our country. For the American economy,
for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind
half our population. We have to socialize our girls
to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them
to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. We have to teach them
to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential
to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them
that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you
to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece,
your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach
girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement
of young women who are brave and who will build
a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have.
You have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls
are involved now in your program? Reshma Saujani: Yeah.
So in 2012, we taught 20 girls. This year we'll teach 40,000
in all 50 states. (Applause) And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated
7,500 women in computer science. Like, the problem is so bad that we can make
that type of change quickly. CA: And you're working with some
of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming
graduates from your program? RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. And if you're not signed up,
I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code
classroom in their office. CA: And you have some stories
back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams,
good things happen. RS: Great things happen. I mean, I think that it's crazy to me
to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all
consumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate
of 600 percent more than men. We own the Internet, and we should be building
the companies of tomorrow. And I think when companies
have diverse teams, and they have incredible women
that are part of their engineering teams, they build awesome things,
and we see it every day. CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.
You're doing incredibly important work. This whole community is cheering you on.
More power to you. Thank you. RS: Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress. For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however,
told a very different story. My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win. But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart
in a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement
from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal
snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest
races in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy
an Indian girl was running. But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers
that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating. Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk
about the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story
of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time
in my entire life that I had done something
that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect. And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate
towards careers and professions that they know
they're going to be great in, that they know they're
going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught
to avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars
and then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise
or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated
to take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously
unless you've had two failed start-ups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave. Some people worry
about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society,
we're just losing out because we're not raising
our girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why
women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look. In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders
handled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls
were quick to give up. The higher the IQ,
the more likely they were to give up. Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material
to be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely
to redouble their efforts. What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys
in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys
and girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found
that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent
of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent
of the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked
as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized
to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. (Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take

to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher
tells me the same story. During the first week,
when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over
and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write." The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better,
she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes
just staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student
wrote code and then deleted it. She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing
the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust. It turns out that our girls
are really good at coding, but it's not enough
just to teach them to code. My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours
with computer science students. When the guys are struggling
with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with my code." The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with me." We have to begin to undo
the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it
with building a sisterhood that lets girls know
that they are not alone. Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me, "I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network
cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. Take, for instance,
two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love
for her new country by building an app
to help Americans get to the polls. Or a 16-year-old girl
who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer
is benign or malignant in the off chance
that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just
three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been
socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying,
who have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams. And those dreams have never been
more important for our country. For the American economy,
for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind
half our population. We have to socialize our girls
to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them
to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. We have to teach them
to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential
to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them
that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you
to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece,
your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach
girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement
of young women who are brave and who will build
a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have.
You have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls
are involved now in your program? Reshma Saujani: Yeah.
So in 2012, we taught 20 girls. This year we'll teach 40,000
in all 50 states. (Applause) And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated
7,500 women in computer science. Like, the problem is so bad that we can make
that type of change quickly. CA: And you're working with some
of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming
graduates from your program? RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. And if you're not signed up,
I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code
classroom in their office. CA: And you have some stories
back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams,
good things happen. RS: Great things happen. I mean, I think that it's crazy to me
to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all
consumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate
of 600 percent more than men. We own the Internet, and we should be building
the companies of tomorrow. And I think when companies
have diverse teams, and they have incredible women
that are part of their engineering teams, they build awesome things,
and we see it every day. CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.
You're doing incredibly important work. This whole community is cheering you on.
More power to you. Thank you. RS: Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress. For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however,
told a very different story. My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win. But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart
in a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement
from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal
snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest
races in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy
an Indian girl was running. But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers
that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating. Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk
about the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story
of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time
in my entire life that I had done something
that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect. And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate
towards careers and professions that they know
they're going to be great in, that they know they're
going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught
to avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars
and then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise
or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated
to take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously
unless you've had two failed start-ups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave. Some people worry
about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society,
we're just losing out because we're not raising
our girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why
women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look. In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders
handled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls
were quick to give up. The higher the IQ,
the more likely they were to give up. Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material
to be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely
to redouble their efforts. What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys
in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys
and girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found
that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent
of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent
of the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked
as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized
to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. (Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take
less risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs
that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy
is being left behind on all the innovation and problems
women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. (Applause) So in 2012, I started a company
to teach girls to code, and what I found
is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process
of trial and error, of trying to get the right command
in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference
between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying
to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher
tells me the same story. During the first week,
when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over
and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write." The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better,

the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it

that they are not alone. Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me, "I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network

Anything we ever achieved started with someone
imagining it first. So if we can’t imagine a way out of the climate
crisis it just can’t happen. We know that the crisis is getting worse every,
single, day and many of us are losing hope for our future. But despair is not an option. We must rise up meet the greatest challenge
of our lives with stubborn optimism. And imagining is the first step So, are you ready to imagine? In this critical decade The biggest tree-planting campaign in history
is sucking billions of tons of carbon out of the air. And forests and indigenous lands? They’re protected! This is what your city looks like...it’s
green. I mean, everywhere. Streets are pedestrian and kid friendly. Food growing on rooftops, in car parks, which
by the way, we don’t need any more, because we don’t own cars any more. And here’s something Birds Can you imagine your city as a sanctuary for
nature and wildlife?! There are solar panels on every rooftop across the globe. Clean, interconnected energy lights every
home, every clinic, every school. We no longer choke on the toxic fumes of fossil
fuels. It’s not hard to imagine. This technology already exists! And what about the millions of new jobs created? Are you picturing it? Really picturing it. Roads? They are green too. Traffic’s cut right down
Public transport everywhere is electric, dependable - and free. Can you smell the air? Clean. Farming? All regenerative. Which means healthy soil and better food. And we don’t eat much meat. Can you imagine what we could do with a third
of the world’s crop land currently used to grow animal feed? Here’s something to imagine:
Fields of seaweed, miles long, grown in oceans across the planet.
They draw down billions of tons of carbon, restore sea life, and guess what, they’re
a limitless source of protein rich food. And we can do so much more. Re-wild our land. Protect our cities from rising sea levels. Restore coral reefs. These things we are imagining? They are all possible now, just with technology
that’s available today. We are the last generation that can prevent
catastrophic, run-away climate change. We cannot give up! Anything we ever achieved started with
someone imagining it first. This is the decade to make this imagined future
happen. Share this video and help those around you
have the courage to imagine it too.

**Transcript**:
At roughly 4pm on July 20, 1969, mankind was just minutes away 
from landing on the surface of the moon. But before the astronauts 
began their final descent, an emergency alarm lit up. Something was overloading 
the computer, and threatened to abort the landing. Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton 
held her breath. She'd led the team developing 
the pioneering in-flight software, so she knew this mission 
had no room for error. But the nature 
of this last-second emergency would soon prove her software 
was working exactly as planned. Born 33 years earlier in Paoli, Indiana, 
Hamilton had always been inquisitive. In college, she studied mathematics
and philosophy, before taking a research position at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pay for grad school. Here, she encountered her first computer
while developing software to support research 
into the new field of chaos theory. Next at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Hamilton developed software 
for America’s first air defense system to search for enemy aircraft. But when she heard 
that renowned engineer Charles Draper was looking for help 
sending mankind to the moon, she immediately joined his team. NASA looked to Draper and his group 
of over 400 engineers to invent the first compact 
digital flight computer, the Apollo Guidance Computer. Using input from astronauts, this device would be responsible 
for guiding, navigating and controlling the spacecraft. At a time when unreliable computers 
filled entire rooms, the AGC needed to operate 
without any errors, and fit in one cubic foot of space. Draper divided the lab into two teams, one for designing hardware 
and one for developing software. Hamilton led the team that built 
the on-board flight software for both the Command and Lunar Modules. This work, for which she coined the term
“software engineering," was incredibly high stakes. Human lives were on the line, 
so every program had to be perfect. Margaret’s software needed to quickly
detect unexpected errors and recover from them in real time. But this kind of adaptable program 
was difficult to build, since early software could only process 
jobs in a predetermined order. To solve this problem, Margaret designed her program 
to be “asynchronous,” meaning the software's more important
jobs would interrupt less important ones. Her team assigned every task 
a unique priority to ensure that each job 
occurred in the correct order and at the right time—
regardless of any surprises. After this breakthrough, Margaret realized her software 
could help the astronauts work in an asynchronous environment as well. She designed Priority Displays that would interrupt 
astronaut’s regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies. The astronaut could then communicate
with Mission Control to determine the best path forward. This marked the first time flight software
communicated directly— and asynchronously— 
with a pilot. It was these fail safes that triggered 
the alarms just before the lunar landing. Buzz Aldrin quickly realized his mistake— he’d inadvertently flipped 
the rendezvous radar switch. This radar would be essential 
on their journey home, but here it was using up 
vital computational resources. Fortunately, the Apollo Guidance Computer
was well equipped to manage this. During the overload, 
the software restart programs allowed only the highest priority jobs 
to be processed— including the programs 
necessary for landing. The Priority Displays 
gave the astronauts a choice— to land or not to land. With minutes to spare, 
Mission Control gave the order. The Apollo 11 landing was about 
the astronauts, Mission Control, software and hardware all working together
as an integrated system of systems. Hamilton’s contributions were essential
to the work of engineers and scientists inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s 
goal to reach the Moon. And her life-saving work 
went far beyond Apollo 11— no bugs were ever found in the in-flight
software for any crewed Apollo missions. After her work on Apollo, Hamilton founded a company that uses 
its unique universal systems language to create breakthroughs 
for systems and software. In 2003, NASA honored her achievements 
with the largest financial award they’d ever given to an individual. And 47 years after her software
first guided astronauts to the moon, Hamilton was awarded 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom for changing the way we think 
about technology.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the project that 400 scientists, including Margaret Hamilton, worked on at MIT to help send people to the Moon. The correct answer is the Apollo Guidance Computer.

Among the generated MCQs, none of them ask about the specific project that 400 scientists worked on at MIT. However, Question 5 mentions the Apollo Guidance Computer and its functionality, which is related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

But a more relevant question is Question 8, which mentions the importance of error-free operation for the Apollo Guidance Computer. Although it doesn't ask about the team size or the project name explicitly, it does relate to the context of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would say that none of the questions match the ground truth MCQ closely. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 5 is the closest, as it at least mentions the Apollo Guidance Computer.

the software restart programs allowed only the highest priority jobs 
to be processed— including the programs 
necessary for landing. The Priority Displays 
gave the astronauts a choice— to land or not to land. With minutes to spare, 
Mission Control gave the order. The Apollo 11 landing was about 
the astronauts, Mission Control, software and hardware all working together
as an integrated system of systems. Hamilton’s contributions were essential
to the work of engineers and scientists inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s 
goal to reach the Moon. And her life-saving work 
went far beyond Apollo 11— no bugs were ever found in the in-flight
software for any crewed Apollo missions. After her work on Apollo, Hamilton founded a company that uses 
its unique universal systems language to create breakthroughs 
for systems and software. In 2003, NASA honored her achievements 
with the largest financial award they’d ever given to an individual. And 47 years after her software
first guided astronauts to the moon, Hamilton was awarded 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom for changing the way we think

**Transcript**:
At roughly 4pm on July 20, 1969, mankind was just minutes away 
from landing on the surface of the moon. But before the astronauts 
began their final descent, an emergency alarm lit up. Something was overloading 
the computer, and threatened to abort the landing. Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton 
held her breath. She'd led the team developing 
the pioneering in-flight software, so she knew this mission 
had no room for error. But the nature 
of this last-second emergency would soon prove her software 
was working exactly as planned. Born 33 years earlier in Paoli, Indiana, 
Hamilton had always been inquisitive. In college, she studied mathematics
and philosophy, before taking a research position at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pay for grad school. Here, she encountered her first computer
while developing software to support research 
into the new field of chaos theory. Next at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Hamilton developed software 
for America’s first air defense system to search for enemy aircraft. But when she heard 
that renowned engineer Charles Draper was looking for help 
sending mankind to the moon, she immediately joined his team. NASA looked to Draper and his group 
of over 400 engineers to invent the first compact 
digital flight computer, the Apollo Guidance Computer. Using input from astronauts, this device would be responsible 
for guiding, navigating and controlling the spacecraft. At a time when unreliable computers 
filled entire rooms, the AGC needed to operate 
without any errors, and fit in one cubic foot of space. Draper divided the lab into two teams, one for designing hardware 
and one for developing software. Hamilton led the team that built 
the on-board flight software for both the Command and Lunar Modules. This work, for which she coined the term
“software engineering," was incredibly high stakes. Human lives were on the line, 
so every program had to be perfect. Margaret’s software needed to quickly
detect unexpected errors and recover from them in real time. But this kind of adaptable program 
was difficult to build, since early software could only process 
jobs in a predetermined order. To solve this problem, Margaret designed her program 
to be “asynchronous,” meaning the software's more important
jobs would interrupt less important ones. Her team assigned every task 
a unique priority to ensure that each job 
occurred in the correct order and at the right time—
regardless of any surprises. After this breakthrough, Margaret realized her software 
could help the astronauts work in an asynchronous environment as well. She designed Priority Displays that would interrupt 
astronaut’s regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies. The astronaut could then communicate
with Mission Control to determine the best path forward. This marked the first time flight software
communicated directly— and asynchronously— 
with a pilot. It was these fail safes that triggered 
the alarms just before the lunar landing. Buzz Aldrin quickly realized his mistake— he’d inadvertently flipped 
the rendezvous radar switch. This radar would be essential 
on their journey home, but here it was using up 
vital computational resources. Fortunately, the Apollo Guidance Computer
was well equipped to manage this. During the overload, 
the software restart programs allowed only the highest priority jobs 
to be processed— including the programs 
necessary for landing. The Priority Displays 
gave the astronauts a choice— to land or not to land. With minutes to spare, 
Mission Control gave the order. The Apollo 11 landing was about 
the astronauts, Mission Control, software and hardware all working together
as an integrated system of systems. Hamilton’s contributions were essential
to the work of engineers and scientists inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s 
goal to reach the Moon. And her life-saving work

**Transcript**:
A woman in rags emerged from the swamp
flanked by seven giant scorpions. Carrying a baby, she headed 
for the nearest village to beg for food. She approached a magnificent mansion, but the mistress of the house 
took one look at her grimy clothes and unusual companions 
and slammed the door in her face. So she continued down the road 
until she came to a cottage. The woman there took pity on the stranger
and offered her what she could: a simple meal and a bed of straw. Her guest was no ordinary beggar. She was Isis, 
the most powerful goddess in Egypt. Isis was in hiding from her brother Set, who murdered her husband and wanted 
to murder her infant son, Horus. Set was also a powerful god, 
and he was looking for them. So to keep her cover, 
Isis had to be very discreet— she couldn’t risk using her powers. But she was not without aid. Serket, goddess of venomous creatures, had sent seven of her fiercest servants 
to guard Isis and her son. As Isis and Horus settled 
into their humble accommodation, the scorpions fumed at how the wealthy
woman had offended their divine mistress. They all combined their venom 
and gave it to one of the seven, Tefen. In the dead of night, 
Tefen crept over to the mansion. As he crawled under the door, he saw the owner’s young son 
sleeping peacefully and gave him a mighty sting. Isis and her hostess were soon awakened
by loud wailing. As they peered out of the doorway 
of the cottage, they saw a mother running 
through the street, weeping as she cradled her son. When Isis recognized the woman 
who had turned her away, she understood what her 
scorpions had done. Isis took the boy in her arms 
and began to recite a powerful spell: "O poison of Tefen, come out of him 
and fall upon the ground! Poison of Befen, advance not, 
penetrate no farther, come out of him, and fall upon the ground! For I am Isis, the great Enchantress, 
the Speaker of spells. Fall down, O poison of Mestet! 
Hasten not, poison of Mestetef! Rise not, poison of Petet and Thetet! 
Approach not, poison of Matet!" With each name she invoked, 
that scorpion’s poison was neutralized. The child stirred, 
and his mother wept with gratitude and lamented her earlier callousness, offering all her wealth 
to Isis in repentance. The woman who had taken Isis in 
watched in awe— she had had no idea who she’d brought
under her roof. And from that day on, the people learned to make a poultice 
to treat scorpion bites, speaking magical incantations 
just as the goddess had.

**Transcript**:
A woman in rags emerged from the swamp
flanked by seven giant scorpions. Carrying a baby, she headed 
for the nearest village to beg for food. She approached a magnificent mansion, but the mistress of the house 
took one look at her grimy clothes and unusual companions 
and slammed the door in her face. So she continued down the road 
until she came to a cottage. The woman there took pity on the stranger
and offered her what she could: a simple meal and a bed of straw. Her guest was no ordinary beggar. She was Isis, 
the most powerful goddess in Egypt. Isis was in hiding from her brother Set, who murdered her husband and wanted 
to murder her infant son, Horus. Set was also a powerful god, 
and he was looking for them. So to keep her cover, 
Isis had to be very discreet— she couldn’t risk using her powers. But she was not without aid. Serket, goddess of venomous creatures, had sent seven of her fiercest servants 
to guard Isis and her son. As Isis and Horus settled 
into their humble accommodation, the scorpions fumed at how the wealthy
woman had offended their divine mistress. They all combined their venom 
and gave it to one of the seven, Tefen. In the dead of night, 
Tefen crept over to the mansion. As he crawled under the door, he saw the owner’s young son 
sleeping peacefully and gave him a mighty sting. Isis and her hostess were soon awakened
by loud wailing. As they peered out of the doorway 
of the cottage, they saw a mother running 
through the street, weeping as she cradled her son. When Isis recognized the woman 
who had turned her away, she understood what her 
scorpions had done. Isis took the boy in her arms 
and began to recite a powerful spell: "O poison of Tefen, come out of him 
and fall upon the ground! Poison of Befen, advance not, 
penetrate no farther, come out of him, and fall upon the ground! For I am Isis, the great Enchantress, 
the Speaker of spells. Fall down, O poison of Mestet! 
Hasten not, poison of Mestetef! Rise not, poison of Petet and Thetet! 
Approach not, poison of Matet!" With each name she invoked, 
that scorpion’s poison was neutralized. The child stirred, 
and his mother wept with gratitude and lamented her earlier callousness, offering all her wealth 
to Isis in repentance. The woman who had taken Isis in 
watched in awe— she had had no idea who she’d brought
under her roof. And from that day on, the people learned to make a poultice 
to treat scorpion bites, speaking magical incantations 
just as the goddess had.

**Transcript**:
In 2013, a team of researchers 
held a math test. The exam was administered 
to over 1,100 American adults, and designed, in part, to test 
their ability to evaluate sets of data. Hidden among these math problems 
were two almost identical questions. Both problems 
used the same difficult data set, and each had one objectively 
correct answer. The first asked about the correlation 
between rashes and a new skin cream. The second asked about the correlation 
between crime rates and gun control legislation. Participants with strong math skills were much more likely 
to get the first question correct. But despite being 
mathematically identical, the results for the second question 
looked totally different. Here, math skills 
weren’t the best predictor of which participants answered correctly. Instead, another variable the researchers 
had been tracking came into play: political identity. Participants whose political beliefs aligned with a correct interpretation 
of the data were far more likely 
to answer the problem right. Even the study’s top mathematicians were 45% more likely 
to get the second question wrong when the correct answer 
challenged their political beliefs. What is it about politics that inspires 
this kind of illogical error? Can someone’s political identity 
actually affect their ability to process information? The answer lies in a cognitive phenomenon that has become increasingly visible 
in public life: partisanship. While it’s often invoked 
in the context of politics, partisanship is more broadly defined 
as a strong preference or bias towards any particular group or idea. Our political, ethnic, religious, 
and national identities are all different forms of partisanship. Of course, identifying with social groups is an essential and healthy part 
of human life. Our sense of self is defined not only by 
who we are as individuals, but also by the groups we belong to. As a result, we’re strongly motivated 
to defend our group identities, protecting both our sense of self 
and our social communities. But this becomes a problem 
when the group’s beliefs are at odds with reality. Imagine watching your favorite sports team
commit a serious foul. You know that’s against the rules, but your fellow fans 
think it’s totally acceptable. The tension between 
these two incompatible thoughts is called cognitive dissonance, and most people are driven to resolve 
this uncomfortable state of limbo. You might start to blame the referee, 
complain that the other team started it, or even convince yourself 
there was no foul in the first place. In a case like this, people are often more motivated 
to maintain a positive relationship with their group 
than perceive the world accurately. This behavior 
is especially dangerous in politics. On an individual scale, allegiance to a party allows people 
to create a political identity and support policies they agree with. But partisan-based cognitive dissonance 
can lead people to reject evidence that’s inconsistent with the party line 
or discredits party leaders. And when entire groups of people revise 
the facts in service of partisan beliefs, it can lead to policies 
that aren’t grounded in truth or reason. This problem isn’t new— political identities 
have been around for centuries. But studies show 
that partisan polarization has increased dramatically 
in the last few decades. One theory explaining this increase is the trend towards clustering 
geographically in like-minded communities. Another is the growing tendency 
to rely on partisan news or social media bubbles. These often act like echo chambers, delivering news and ideas 
from people with similar views. Fortunately, cognitive scientists 
have uncovered some strategies for resisting this distortion filter. One is to remember that you’re probably 
more biased than you think. So when you encounter new information, make a deliberate effort 
to push through your initial intuition and evaluate it analytically. In your own groups, try to make 
fact-checking and questioning assumptions a valued part of the culture. Warning people that they might have been 
presented with misinformation can also help. And when you’re trying 
to persuade someone else, affirming their values 
and framing the issue in their language can help make people more receptive. We still have a long way to go before 
solving the problem of partisanship. But hopefully, these tools 
can help keep us better informed, and capable of making evidence-based 
decisions about our shared reality.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In 2013, a team of researchers 
held a math test. The exam was administered 
to over 1,100 American adults, and designed, in part, to test 
their ability to evaluate sets of data. Hidden among these math problems 
were two almost identical questions. Both problems 
used the same difficult data set, and each had one objectively 
correct answer. The first asked about the correlation 
between rashes and a new skin cream. The second asked about the correlation 
between crime rates and gun control legislation. Participants with strong math skills were much more likely 
to get the first question correct. But despite being 
mathematically identical, the results for the second question 
looked totally different. Here, math skills 
weren’t the best predictor of which participants answered correctly. Instead, another variable the researchers 
had been tracking came into play: political identity. Participants whose political beliefs aligned with a correct interpretation 
of the data were far more likely 
to answer the problem right. Even the study’s top mathematicians were 45% more likely 
to get the second question wrong when the correct answer 
challenged their political beliefs. What is it about politics that inspires 
this kind of illogical error? Can someone’s political identity 
actually affect their ability to process information? The answer lies in a cognitive phenomenon that has become increasingly visible 
in public life: partisanship. While it’s often invoked 
in the context of politics, partisanship is more broadly defined 
as a strong preference or bias towards any particular group or idea. Our political, ethnic, religious, 
and national identities are all different forms of partisanship. Of course, identifying with social groups is an essential and healthy part 
of human life. Our sense of self is defined not only by 
who we are as individuals, but also by the groups we belong to. As a result, we’re strongly motivated 
to defend our group identities, protecting both our sense of self 
and our social communities. But this becomes a problem 
when the group’s beliefs are at odds with reality. Imagine watching your favorite sports team
commit a serious foul. You know that’s against the rules, but your fellow fans 
think it’s totally acceptable. The tension between 
these two incompatible thoughts is called cognitive dissonance, and most people are driven to resolve 
this uncomfortable state of limbo. You might start to blame the referee, 
complain that the other team started it, or even convince yourself 
there was no foul in the first place. In a case like this, people are often more motivated 
to maintain a positive relationship with their group 
than perceive the world accurately. This behavior 
is especially dangerous in politics. On an individual scale, allegiance to a party allows people 
to create a political identity and support policies they agree with. But partisan-based cognitive dissonance 
can lead people to reject evidence that’s inconsistent with the party line 
or discredits party leaders. And when entire groups of people revise 
the facts in service of partisan beliefs, it can lead to policies 
that aren’t grounded in truth or reason. This problem isn’t new— political identities 
have been around for centuries. But studies show 
that partisan polarization has increased dramatically 
in the last few decades. One theory explaining this increase is the trend towards clustering 
geographically in like-minded communities. Another is the growing tendency 
to rely on partisan news or social media bubbles. These often act like echo chambers, delivering news and ideas 
from people with similar views. Fortunately, cognitive scientists 
have uncovered some strategies for resisting this distortion filter. One is to remember that you’re probably 
more biased than you think. So when you encounter new information, make a deliberate effort 
to push through your initial intuition and evaluate it analytically. In your own groups, try to make 
fact-checking and questioning assumptions a valued part of the culture. Warning people that they might have been 
presented with misinformation can also help. And when you’re trying 
to persuade someone else, affirming their values 
and framing the issue in their language can help make people more receptive. We still have a long way to go before 
solving the problem of partisanship. But hopefully, these tools 
can help keep us better informed, and capable of making evidence-based 
decisions about our shared reality.

Correct Option: B

Although this question does not directly ask about persuading someone from another group, it does provide a relevant strategy (fact-checking and questioning assumptions) that can be applied in a broader context, including persuasion. Additionally, the ground truth MCQ's correct option "Use their language" is related to the idea of framing the issue in the other person's language, which is mentioned in the transcript as a strategy for persuasion.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more closely related to persuasion, I would suggest that a new question be generated based on the content of the transcript.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new question that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

Alternatively, I can also provide the index of a question that I think is somewhat related, but not a perfect match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. However, the options provided in Question 5 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

A more similar generated MCQ is Question 10, but it is still not an exact match.

Upon closer inspection, Question 6 is also a good match, but it does not explicitly mention the distortion filter of identity.

Considering all the options, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match, but it would be more accurate to create a new question that combines elements of Questions 5, 6, and 10.

However, if I had to choose one of the existing questions, I would choose Question 5.

**Transcript**:
Centuries ago, the Inca developed 
ingenuous suits of armor that could flex 
with the blows of sharp spears and maces, protecting warriors 
from even the fiercest physical attacks. These hardy structures 
were made not from iron or steel, but rather something unexpectedly soft: 
cotton. These thickly woven, 
layered quilts of cotton could distribute the energy from a blow 
across a large surface area, shielding warriors 
without restricting their mobility. These seemingly contradictory features— strength and flexibility, 
softness and durability— have their roots in the intricate biology 
of the nearly invisible cotton fiber. These fibers begin life 
deep within a cotton flower, on the surface of a seed. As many as 16,000 fibers 
will festoon a single seed, bulging from the seed’s surface 
like miniature water balloons. Each cotton fiber, 
no matter how large it grows, is made of just one cell. That cell has multiple layers 
of cell wall. After a few days, 
the sides of the first layer, called the primary cell wall, stiffen, pushing cell growth 
in one direction and causing the fiber to elongate. The fiber elongates 
quickly for about 16 days. Then it begins the next stage: 
strengthening the cell wall. It does this by making more 
of the carbohydrate cellulose. Cellulose will make up 
34% of the cell wall at this stage and swiftly increases. This new growth 
also reinforces the cell wall by going against the grain 
of the existing wall. The strengthened wall is more rigid, 
restricting further growth. That means if the fiber 
remodels its walls too early, it will be short, and ultimately make rough, weak fabrics. But if cell wall strengthening 
begins too late, the wall won’t be sturdy enough— producing fibers that are too weak 
to hold fabrics together well. In ideal growing conditions— with the right temperature, water, 
fertilizer, pest control, and light— a cotton fiber can grow 
up to 3.6 centimeters long with only a 25 micrometer width. Long, fine fibers 
can wrap around one another better than shorter, 
less fine fibers, which means those long, fine fibers 
make stronger threads that hang together better as fabric. Cotton with these qualities 
has diverse uses— from soft textiles 
to the U.S. dollar bill, which is 75% cotton. The next crucial stage 
of the cotton fiber’s growth begins as it thickens 
its secondary cell wall by depositing large quantities 
of cellulose into the secondary layer. Cellulose goes on to make up 
over 90% of the fiber’s weight. The more cellulose that gets deposited, the denser that secondary layer becomes— and this determines 
the strength of the final fiber. This stage is essential 
for developing long-lasting material for the likes of, say, a t-shirt. The garment’s capacity 
to withstand years of washing and wear is largely determined by the density 
of that secondary cell wall. On the other hand, its softness is strongly influenced 
by the length of the fiber, established with the remodeling 
of the primary wall layer. Finally, after about 50 days, 
the fiber is fully grown. The living matter 
within the cell dies off, leaving behind only the cellulose. The dried cotton seed pod, or boll, 
that surrounds the fibers cracks open, unveiling a burst of several thousand 
fiber cells in a fluffy mass. The thread-like fibers we see— 
thinner than a human hair— are the remains of those dense, 
dried out walls of cellulose. Tens of thousands of these fibers 
spun into yarn will go on to make everything from fabric,
to coffee filters, diapers, and fishing nets. And with the help of modern science, cotton might soon be softer, stronger, 
and more resilient than ever as researchers investigate 
how to optimize its growth based on nutrients, weather conditions, 
and genetics.

**Transcript**:
Centuries ago, the Inca developed 
ingenuous suits of armor that could flex 
with the blows of sharp spears and maces, protecting warriors 
from even the fiercest physical attacks. These hardy structures 
were made not from iron or steel, but rather something unexpectedly soft: 
cotton. These thickly woven, 
layered quilts of cotton could distribute the energy from a blow 
across a large surface area, shielding warriors 
without restricting their mobility. These seemingly contradictory features— strength and flexibility, 
softness and durability— have their roots in the intricate biology 
of the nearly invisible cotton fiber. These fibers begin life 
deep within a cotton flower, on the surface of a seed. As many as 16,000 fibers 
will festoon a single seed, bulging from the seed’s surface 
like miniature water balloons. Each cotton fiber, 
no matter how large it grows, is made of just one cell. That cell has multiple layers 
of cell wall. After a few days, 
the sides of the first layer, called the primary cell wall, stiffen, pushing cell growth 
in one direction and causing the fiber to elongate. The fiber elongates 
quickly for about 16 days. Then it begins the next stage: 
strengthening the cell wall. It does this by making more 
of the carbohydrate cellulose. Cellulose will make up 
34% of the cell wall at this stage and swiftly increases. This new growth 
also reinforces the cell wall by going against the grain 
of the existing wall. The strengthened wall is more rigid, 
restricting further growth. That means if the fiber 
remodels its walls too early, it will be short, and ultimately make rough, weak fabrics. But if cell wall strengthening 
begins too late, the wall won’t be sturdy enough— producing fibers that are too weak 
to hold fabrics together well. In ideal growing conditions— with the right temperature, water, 
fertilizer, pest control, and light— a cotton fiber can grow 
up to 3.6 centimeters long with only a 25 micrometer width. Long, fine fibers 
can wrap around one another better than shorter, 
less fine fibers, which means those long, fine fibers 
make stronger threads that hang together better as fabric. Cotton with these qualities 
has diverse uses— from soft textiles 
to the U.S. dollar bill, which is 75% cotton. The next crucial stage 
of the cotton fiber’s growth begins as it thickens 
its secondary cell wall by depositing large quantities 
of cellulose into the secondary layer. Cellulose goes on to make up 
over 90% of the fiber’s weight. The more cellulose that gets deposited, the denser that secondary layer becomes— and this determines 
the strength of the final fiber. This stage is essential 
for developing long-lasting material for the likes of, say, a t-shirt. The garment’s capacity 
to withstand years of washing and wear is largely determined by the density 
of that secondary cell wall. On the other hand, its softness is strongly influenced 
by the length of the fiber, established with the remodeling 
of the primary wall layer. Finally, after about 50 days, 
the fiber is fully grown. The living matter 
within the cell dies off, leaving behind only the cellulose. The dried cotton seed pod, or boll, 
that surrounds the fibers cracks open, unveiling a burst of several thousand 
fiber cells in a fluffy mass. The thread-like fibers we see— 
thinner than a human hair— are the remains of those dense, 
dried out walls of cellulose. Tens of thousands of these fibers 
spun into yarn will go on to make everything from fabric,
to coffee filters, diapers, and fishing nets. And with the help of modern science, cotton might soon be softer, stronger, 
and more resilient than ever as researchers investigate 
how to optimize its growth based on nutrients, weather conditions, 
and genetics.

Transcriber: Joseph Geni
Reviewer: Morton Bast When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job
in management consulting for a job that was even more
demanding: teaching. I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher,
I made quizzes and tests. I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back,
I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ
was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers
did not have stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids
weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking. The kinds of things you need
to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals,
the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced
that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion
that what we need in education is a much better understanding
of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective. In education, the one thing
we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing
well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn
quickly and easily? So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school
to become a psychologist. I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super
challenging settings, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why? My research team and I went
to West Point Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training
and which would drop out. We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children
would advance farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers
working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still
going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year, and of those, who will be
the most effective at improving learning
outcomes for their students? We partnered with private
companies, asking, which of these salespeople
is going to keep their jobs? And who's going to earn the most money? In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged
as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit. Grit is passion and perseverance
for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future,
day in, day out, not just for the week,
not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard
to make that future a reality. Grit is living life
like it's a marathon, not a sprint. A few years ago, I started studying grit
in the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more
likely to graduate, even when I matched them
on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt
when they were at school. So it's not just at West Point
or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school, especially for kids
at risk for dropping out. To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows,
about building it. Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I build grit in kids? What do I do to teach kids
a solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated
for the long run?" The honest answer is, I don't know. (Laughter) What I do know is that talent
doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through
on their commitments. In fact, in our data,
grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related
to measures of talent. So far, the best idea I've heard
about building grit in kids is something called "growth mindset." This is an idea developed
at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability
to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read
and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows
in response to challenge, they're much more likely
to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure
is a permanent condition. So growth mindset
is a great idea for building grit. But we need more. And that's where I'm going
to end my remarks, because that's where we are. That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas,
our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them. We need to measure
whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing
to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. Thank you. (Applause)

Our bodies need lots of energy to keep us
going throughout the day. And do you know where we get that energy? That’s right…from the food we eat! And all kinds of different people enjoy different
kinds of food. But whether your favorite meal includes noodles
or nectarines, tortillas or tofu, most types of food have some of what our bodies need
to stay healthy. You might already know that we can put different
kinds of food into different groups. We call these, you guessed it, food groups! But let’s check out each group, and see
what kind of food belongs where! Let’s start with the fruit group. You gotta love sweet, delicious fruit! This group includes things like apples and
pears, oranges and strawberries. Fresh fruit is the best for you, but fruit
that’s canned or frozen counts, too. After all, many fruits are hard to find in
the winter, and some fruits only grow in certain parts of the world. But don’t forget about fruit that’s been
dried! Raisins are just dried grapes! And prunes are dried-up plums! And even juice is part of the fruit group,
but only if it’s all fruit juice and doesn’t have added sugar. Next comes the grain group. Grains are plants, like oats, wheat, and barley. If a food is made from one of these plants,
or any other grain plant, it belongs here. That means things made of flour, like bread
and noodles, breakfast foods like oatmeal and cereal, and even rice, are all part of
this group. Next up, the vegetable group. I bet you already figured out what goes here! Vegetables come from plants, too -- but unlike
grains, they’re either the roots, stems, or leaves of certain plants that we can eat! Carrots, for example, are the sweet orange
roots of the carrot plant. A head of lettuce is just a bunch of crunchy
leaves. And asparagus is actually a stem of the tasty
asparagus plant! There are so many kinds of veggies out there,
that we can actually split this group into smaller groups. For example, there are dark green veggies,
like spinach. Starchy vegetables, like potatoes and sweet
potatoes. Then, there are red and orange veggies, like
beets and carrots, just to name a few. Now, what other foods can you think of? What about the stuff that’s inside your
sandwich? Meats, like chicken or hamburger, belong to
the protein group. And so do fish, like tuna, and eggs, made
any way you like! But not all members of this group come from
animals. Other foods like beans, peanut butter, and
tofu, which is made from soybeans, are full of protein, so they’re also proud members
of the protein group. And that leaves us with the last group, dairy. If a food is made from cow milk or soy milk,
it’s in the dairy group. So this is where you find things like yogurt,
and all kinds of cheeses, as well as your usual glass of milk. And do you know what else fits in this group? Ice cream! But that reminds me, sweet treats like candy
don’t fit into any of our groups. That’s because they’re made of mostly
sugar, and don’t have any of the things that our bodies need to stay healthy. So, it’s okay to enjoy these foods from
time to time … but just not a lot of the time. Now, do you think you can put a food into
the right group? Let’s take a tasty food quiz and see how
well we know our food groups! We’ll start with a slice of pineapple. What group do you think it goes in? Squeaks says the fruit group. Good job, Squeaks! Yes, pineapple belongs in the fruit group. What about this hard boiled egg? What group do you think this fits into? That’s right, the protein group. Eggs are a good source of protein. Here’s one more. We’ll end our game with a food that fits
into two groups: macaroni and cheese. Let’s look at each part separately. The cheese from the mac and cheese fits into
the dairy group, because it’s made from milk. But what about the macaroni noodles? Well, we learned earlier that noodles are
made of flour from grain. So, that means the macaroni belongs to the
grain group! That’s right! Macaroni and cheese contains foods that are
in the dairy group and the grain group. Whew! All this guessing has made me hungry! Hey Squeaks! Let’s make a snack! And remember, the next time you’re hungry
and head to the pantry or fridge…choose something healthy…and see if you can guess

**Transcript**:
Our bodies need lots of energy to keep us
going throughout the day. And do you know where we get that energy? That’s right…from the food we eat! And all kinds of different people enjoy different
kinds of food. But whether your favorite meal includes noodles
or nectarines, tortillas or tofu, most types of food have some of what our bodies need
to stay healthy. You might already know that we can put different
kinds of food into different groups. We call these, you guessed it, food groups! But let’s check out each group, and see
what kind of food belongs where! Let’s start with the fruit group. You gotta love sweet, delicious fruit! This group includes things like apples and
pears, oranges and strawberries. Fresh fruit is the best for you, but fruit
that’s canned or frozen counts, too. After all, many fruits are hard to find in
the winter, and some fruits only grow in certain parts of the world. But don’t forget about fruit that’s been
dried! Raisins are just dried grapes! And prunes are dried-up plums! And even juice is part of the fruit group,
but only if it’s all fruit juice and doesn’t have added sugar. Next comes the grain group. Grains are plants, like oats, wheat, and barley. If a food is made from one of these plants,

or narrowing of the road. So why the @#$%! is there 
so much traffic? When traffic comes to a near standstill 
for no apparent reason, it’s called a phantom traffic jam. A phantom traffic jam 
is an emergent phenomenon whose behavior takes on a life of its own,
greater than the sum of its parts. But in spite of this, 
we can actually model these jams, even understand the principles 
that shape them— and we’re closer than you might think to preventing this kind of traffic
in the future. For a phantom traffic jam to form, 
there must be a lot of cars on the road. That doesn’t mean 
there are necessarily too many cars to pass through a stretch 
of roadway smoothly, at least not if every driver maintains 
the same consistent speed and spacing from other drivers. In this dense, but flowing, traffic, it only takes a minor disturbance 
to set off the chain of events that causes a traffic jam. Say one driver brakes slightly. Each successive driver then brakes 
a little more strongly, creating a wave of brake lights 
that propagates backward through the cars on the road. These stop-and-go waves 
can travel along a highway for miles. With a low density of cars on the road, traffic flows smoothly 
because small disturbances, like individual cars changing lanes 
or slowing down at a curve, are absorbed by other 
drivers’ adjustments. But once the number of cars 
on the road exceeds a critical density, generally when cars are spaced 
less than 35 meters apart, the system’s behavior 
changes dramatically. It begins to display dynamic instability, 
meaning small disturbances are amplified. Dynamic instability isn’t unique 
to phantom traffic jams— it’s also responsible for raindrops, 
sand dunes, cloud patterns, and more. The instability is 
a positive feedback loop. Above the critical density, any additional vehicle reduces 
the number of cars per second passing through a given point on the road. This in turn means it takes longer 
for a local pileup to move out of a section of the road, 
increasing vehicle density even more, which eventually adds up 
to stop-and-go traffic. Drivers tend not to realize they need 
to break far in advance of a traffic jam, which means they end up having 
to brake harder to avoid a collision. This strengthens the wave of braking 
from vehicle to vehicle. What’s more, drivers tend to accelerate
too rapidly out of a slowdown, meaning they try to drive faster than the average flow of traffic 
downstream of them. Then, they have to brake again, 
eventually producing another feedback loop that causes more stop-and-go traffic. In both cases, drivers make traffic worse simply because they don’t have a good
sense of the conditions ahead of them. Self driving cars equipped with data 
on traffic conditions ahead from connected vehicles 
or roadway sensors might be able to counteract 
phantom traffic in real-time. These vehicles would maintain 
a uniform speed, safety permitting, that matches the average speed 
of the overall flow, preventing traffic waves from forming. In situations where there’s 
already a traffic wave, the automated vehicle 
would be able to anticipate it, braking sooner and more gradually 
than a human driver and reducing the strength of the wave. And it wouldn’t take that many 
self-driving cars— In a recent experiment, one autonomous 
vehicle for every 20 human drivers was enough to dampen 
and prevent traffic waves. Traffic jams are not only 
a daily annoyance– they’re a major cause of fatalities, wasted resources, 
and planet-threatening pollution. But new technology may help reduce 
these patterns, rendering our roads safer, our daily commutes more efficient, 
and our air cleaner. And the next time you’re stuck in traffic, it may help to remember that other drivers
aren’t necessarily driving spitefully, but are simply unaware of road 
conditions ahead— and drive accordingly.

and our air cleaner. And the next time you’re stuck in traffic, it may help to remember that other drivers
aren’t necessarily driving spitefully, but are simply unaware of road 
conditions ahead— and drive accordingly.

grinch simply said if i can't find a reindeer i'll make one instead so he called his dog max then he took some red thread and he tied a big horn on the top of his head [Music] then he loaded some bags and some old empty sacks on a ramshackle sleigh and he hitched up old max then the grinch said get up and the sleigh started down toward the homes where the whos lay a snooze in their town all their windows were dark quiet snow filled the air all the whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care when he came to the first little house on the square this is stop number one the old grinchy claws hissed and he climbed to the roof empty bags in his fist then he slid down the chimney a rather tight pinch but if santa could do it then so could the grinch he got stuck only once for a moment or two

most unpleasant around the whole room and he took every present pop guns and bicycles roller skates drums checkerboards tricycles popcorn and plums [Music] and he stuffed them in bags then the grinch very nimbly stuffed all the bags one by one up the chimbley then he slunk to the icebox he took the who's feast he took the who pudding he took the roast beast [Music] he cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash why that grinch even took their last can of who hash [Music] then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee and now grinned the grinch i will stuff up the tree and the grinch grabbed the tree and he started to shove when he heard a small sound like the coup of a dove [Music] he turned around fast and he saw a small who little cindy lou who who was not more than two [Music] the grinch had been caught by this tiny hoo daughter who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water she stared at the grinch and said santy claus why why are you taking our christmas tree why [Music] but you know that old grinch was so smart and so slick he thought up a lie and he thought it up quick why my sweet little tot the fake santy claws lied there's a light on this tree that won't light on one side [Music] so i'm taking it home to my workshop my dear i'll fix it up there then i'll bring it back here and his fib fooled the child then he patted her head and he got her a drink and he sent her to bed [Music] and when cindy lou who went to bed with her cup he went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up then the last thing he took was the log for their fire then he went up the chimney himself the old liar on their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire [Music] and the one speck of food that he left in the house was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse then he did the same thing to the other who's houses leaving crumbs much too small for the other whose mouses it was quarter past dawn all the who's still a bed all the who's still a snooze when he packed up his sled [Music] packed it up with their presents the ribbons the wrappings the tags and the tinsel the trimmings the trappings [Music] three thousand feet up up the side of mount crumpet he rode with his load

will hang open a minute or two then the who's down in whoville will all cry boo hoo that's a noise grinned the grinch that i simply must hear so he paused and the grinch put his hand to his ear [Music] and he did hear a sound rising over the snow it started in low then it started to grow but the sound wasn't sad why the sound sounded merry it couldn't be so but it was mary very [Music] he

However, I noticed that the correct option for the Ground Truth MCQ was listed as A, but it should be B. The Grinch decides to steal Christmas from the Whos.

If I were to find a better match for the Ground Truth MCQ, I would look for a generated question that asks about the Grinch's target for stealing Christmas. 

Let's assume I found a new generated MCQ:

**Transcript**:
You’ve been accused of a crime 
you did not commit. It’s impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist that you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty 
and executed. But if you confess, apologize, 
and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession— 
or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing 
those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts 
between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia 
about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor— and a justice system that valued 
repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, 
a group of English protestants. Life was strict and isolated 
for the people of Salem. Battles with their 
Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers
were commonplace. People feared starvation and disease, and relations between villagers 
were strained. To make matters worse, 1692 brought 
one of the coldest winters on record. That winter, two cousins, 9 year old Betty Parris and 
11 year old Abigail Williams started behaving very strangely. A physician found nothing 
physically wrong — but diagnosed the girls 
as under “an evil hand.” Puritans believed that the Devil wreaked 
havoc in the world through human agents, or witches, who blighted nature, 
conjured fiendish apparitions, and tormented children. As news swept through the village, 
the symptoms appeared to spread. Accounts describe 12 so-called 
“afflicted” girls contorting their bodies, having fits, 
and complaining of prickling skin. Four of the girls soon accused three
local women of tormenting them. All three of the accused were considered 
outsiders in some way. On February 29th, 
the authorities arrested Sarah Good, a poor pregnant mother 
of a young daughter, Sarah Osbourne,
who had long been absent from church and was suing the family 
of one of her accusers, and Tituba, an enslaved woman 
in Betty Parris’s home known by her first name only. Tituba denied harming the girls at first. But then she confessed to practicing 
witchcraft on the Devil’s orders, and charged Good and Osbourne 
with having forced her. Osbourne and Good both 
maintained their innocence. Osbourne died in prison, while Good’s 
husband turned against her in court, testifying that she "was a witch 
or would be one very quickly." Good’s 4 year old daughter 
was imprisoned and eventually gave testimony 
against her mother. Meanwhile, Good gave birth in jail. Her baby died, and she was convicted 
and hanged shortly thereafter. Tituba was held in custody until May,
and then released. These three victims were 
just the beginning. As accusations multiplied, 
others, like Tituba, made false confession to save themselves. The authorities even reportedly 
told one accused witch that she would be hanged if she did not 
confess, and freed if she did. They were not particularly interested
in thoroughly investigating the charges— in keeping with their Church’s teachings, 
they preferred that the accused confessed, asked for forgiveness, and promised 
not to engage in more witchcraft. The court accepted all kinds 
of dubious evidence, including so-called “spectral evidence” in which the girls began raving when 
supposedly touched by invisible ghosts. Complicating matters further, 
many of the jurors in the trials were relatives of the accusers,
compromising their objectivity. Those who dared to speak out, 
such as Judge Nathanial Saltonstall, came under suspicion. By the spring of 1693, 
over a hundred people had been imprisoned, and 14 women 
and 6 men had been executed. By this time, accusations were starting 
to spread beyond Salem to neighboring communities, and even 
the most powerful figures were targets. When his own wife was accused, the governor of Massachusetts colony 
suspended the trials. Sentences were amended, 
prisoners released, and arrests stopped. Some have speculated that the girls 
were suffering from hallucinations caused by fungus; or a condition that caused 
swelling of the brain. But ultimately, the reason 
for their behavior is unknown. What we do know is that adults 
accepted wild accusations by children as hard evidence. Today, the Salem Witch Trials remain 
a cautionary tale of the dangers of groupthink 
and scapegoating, and the power of fear 
to manipulate human perception.

**Transcript**:
You’ve been accused of a crime 
you did not commit. It’s impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist that you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty 
and executed. But if you confess, apologize, 
and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession— 
or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing 
those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts 
between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia 
about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor— and a justice system that valued 
repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, 
a group of English protestants. Life was strict and isolated 
for the people of Salem. Battles with their 
Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers
were commonplace. People feared starvation and disease, and relations between villagers 
were strained. To make matters worse, 1692 brought 
one of the coldest winters on record. That winter, two cousins, 9 year old Betty Parris and 
11 year old Abigail Williams started behaving very strangely. A physician found nothing 
physically wrong — but diagnosed the girls 
as under “an evil hand.” Puritans believed that the Devil wreaked 
havoc in the world through human agents, or witches, who blighted nature, 
conjured fiendish apparitions, and tormented children. As news swept through the village, 
the symptoms appeared to spread. Accounts describe 12 so-called 
“afflicted” girls contorting their bodies, having fits, 
and complaining of prickling skin. Four of the girls soon accused three
local women of tormenting them. All three of the accused were considered 
outsiders in some way. On February 29th, 
the authorities arrested Sarah Good, a poor pregnant mother 
of a young daughter, Sarah Osbourne,
who had long been absent from church and was suing the family 
of one of her accusers, and Tituba, an enslaved woman 
in Betty Parris’s home known by her first name only. Tituba denied harming the girls at first. But then she confessed to practicing 
witchcraft on the Devil’s orders, and charged Good and Osbourne 
with having forced her. Osbourne and Good both 
maintained their innocence. Osbourne died in prison, while Good’s 
husband turned against her in court, testifying that she "was a witch 
or would be one very quickly." Good’s 4 year old daughter 
was imprisoned and eventually gave testimony 
against her mother. Meanwhile, Good gave birth in jail. Her baby died, and she was convicted 
and hanged shortly thereafter. Tituba was held in custody until May,
and then released. These three victims were 
just the beginning. As accusations multiplied, 
others, like Tituba, made false confession to save themselves. The authorities even reportedly 
told one accused witch that she would be hanged if she did not 
confess, and freed if she did. They were not particularly interested
in thoroughly investigating the charges— in keeping with their Church’s teachings, 
they preferred that the accused confessed, asked for forgiveness, and promised 
not to engage in more witchcraft. The court accepted all kinds 
of dubious evidence, including so-called “spectral evidence” in which the girls began raving when 
supposedly touched by invisible ghosts. Complicating matters further, 
many of the jurors in the trials were relatives of the accusers,
compromising their objectivity. Those who dared to speak out, 
such as Judge Nathanial Saltonstall, came under suspicion. By the spring of 1693, 
over a hundred people had been imprisoned, and 14 women 
and 6 men had been executed. By this time, accusations were starting 
to spread beyond Salem to neighboring communities, and even 
the most powerful figures were targets. When his own wife was accused, the governor of Massachusetts colony 
suspended the trials. Sentences were amended, 
prisoners released, and arrests stopped. Some have speculated that the girls 
were suffering from hallucinations caused by fungus; or a condition that caused 
swelling of the brain. But ultimately, the reason 
for their behavior is unknown. What we do know is that adults 
accepted wild accusations by children as hard evidence. Today, the Salem Witch Trials remain 
a cautionary tale of the dangers of groupthink 
and scapegoating, and the power of fear 
to manipulate human perception.

Hi! OK everybody... The English language has many words. Like this. Ho! So many words! And every word can be split into parts. We call these parts syllables. A word could have one, or two, or three, or
four, or even more syllables. Could a word have 1 million syllables? No, that is too many syllables. What about four syllables? Yes, I already said that. Ha! No more questions! Anyway! A syllable is like a beat. Do you know what a beat is? DRUMMER! Please play a beat. Thank you. That is a good beat. You can make a beat by clapping your hands. Get those hands up! Let’s practice one beat. OK ready, here we go: Clap! Ho ho! Now let's try it with some words. We will start with the easy ones. Words with one syllable - and therefore - one
beat. The first word is dog. Dog. I SAID DOG! Ha ha! Good girl. Now everybody clap your hands to make one
beat when I say the word Dog. OK ready, here we go: Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog! Hey! Good job. Next we will try a word with two syllables:
Apple. Apple. I SAID APPLE! Ho! Thank you! The word Apple has two syllables - and therefore
- two beats. It is kind of like it is split into two parts,
like this. The first part is 'Ap' and the second is 'ple'. Now everybody clap your hands and make a beat
when I say each part of the word Apple. OK ready, here we go: Ap-ple Ap-ple Ap-ple
Ap-ple Ap-ple. Yay! Ho ho! You're doing great! Next we will try a word with three syllables:
Ladybug. Ladybug. I SAID LADYBUG! Wow, that is a big ladybug. The word Ladybug has three syllables - and
therefore - three beats. It is kind of like it is split into three
parts. The first part is 'Lay', the second is 'dy'
and the third part is 'bug'. Now everybody clap your hands and make a beat
when I say each part of the word Ladybug. OK ready, here we go: La-dy-bug La-dy-bug
La-dy-bug La-dy-bug La-dy-bug! Good job. And finally, we will try a word with four syllables:
Salamander. Salamander. I SAID SALAMANDER! Ho! Hi Salamander. The word Salamander has four syllables - and
therefore - four beats. It is kind of like it is split into four parts. The first part is 'Sal' the second part is 'a',
the third part is 'man', and the last is 'der'. Now everybody clap your hands and make a beat
when I say each part of the word Salamander. OK ready, here we go: Sal-a-man-der Sal-a-man-der
Sal-a-man-der Sal-a-man-der! Ho! Yay! Superb! Wow! That's it for now! Until next time, see you later!

**Transcript**:
A baby cursed at birth. 
A fierce battle of good and evil. A true love awoken with a kiss. Sleeping Beauty is one of the world’s 
favorite folktales. But one of its most famous renditions
tells the story without a single word. Since premiering in 1890, "The Sleeping Beauty" has become one of the most frequently staged 
ballets in history. So what makes this piece so beloved? And what exactly does ballet bring 
to this— or any other story? At the heart of ballet 
are dozens of gestures that dancers painstakingly perfect
over thousands of hours of practice. This unique set of gestures 
has been used for centuries, each movement rich with meaning 
and history. But you don’t need to study them 
to understand ballet, any more than you need to study 
music to be moved by a song. And just as composers combine notes 
and phrases to form pieces of music, choreographers string these gestures 
together with new movements to form expressive combinations. Working alongside the orchestra’s 
live score, ballerinas precisely perform these 
combinations to convey narrative, emotion, and character. In "The Sleeping Beauty’s" opening scene, a flurry of techniques depicts 
the fairy court bestowing gifts on baby Princess Aurora. The Fairy of Generosity 
delicately walks “en pointe”— meaning on the tips of her toes— in step with the light plucking 
of violins. The ballerina moves in perfect harmony 
with the music, even mimicing the violins’ trill 
with an elegant bourrée. The Fairy of Temperance, bestowing 
the gift of strong will on Aurora, is choreographed as if shooting bolts 
of electricity from her fingers. She bounds across the stage, spinning with quick chaînés 
before decisively jetéing. Some movements are even more literal 
than this. The evil fairy Carabosse curses 
the princess with a lethal “X,” and the benevolent Lilac Fairy 
counters that curse. Of course, the relationship 
between music and movement isn’t always this straightforward. While classical ballet gestures 
often respond to musical elements, the degree to which the dancers 
and orchestra align is another choreographic tool. Some characters and scenes move 
in sync to create rhythmic clarity, while others deliberately diverge 
from the orchestra. Dancers and musicians maintain 
this delicate balance throughout each performance, engaging in a live negotiation 
of speed and rhythm. But prior to the performance, 
a ballet’s most important relationship is between the choreographer 
and the music. Choreographer Marius Petipa 
and composer Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky worked together on every second 
of "The Sleeping Beauty." This is particularly noticeable 
in Princess Aurora’s exuberant entrance on her 16th birthday. Tchaikovsky’s enthusiastic music 
tumbles forward in fits and starts, even cutting short some musical 
phrases to capture her impatience. Petipa choreographs Aurora bouncing 
back and forth with “pas de chat”— French for "cat steps"— 
as she waits for her party to begin. Once the celebration starts,
it’s up to the dancers to deliver on the physical spectacle of performing
these gestures with grace. Aurora has the hardest part of all: 
her famous Rose Adagio. As four suitors vie for her hand, the Princess performs a dizzying array 
of balances, all en pointe. She briefly takes each suitor’s hand, 
but then balances unassisted— a breath-taking display 
of physical strength and skill. However, it’s not just technique 
that carries meaning, but also style and personality. Like an actor delivering their lines, ballerinas can execute their movements
to convey a wide range of emotion. Aurora can be elegant and restrained, throwing her arms in independence 
from her suitors. Or she can be coy and flirtatious,
descending from en pointe with grace and knowing confidence. "The Sleeping Beauty" offers a showcase
for so much of what ballet can do. Its graceful spectacle, 
dramatic physical vocabulary, and enchanting coordination 
of music and movement perfectly reflect the themes 
of this fantastical romance. But ballet isn’t just for epic fairytales. Ballets can be non-narrative 
emotional journeys, experimental deconstructions of form, or pure demonstrations of skill. The artform is always experimenting 
with a centuries old set of rules, making it the perfect medium 
for stories old and new.

are dozens of gestures that dancers painstakingly perfect
over thousands of hours of practice. This unique set of gestures 
has been used for centuries, each movement rich with meaning 
and history. But you don’t need to study them 
to understand ballet, any more than you need to study 
music to be moved by a song. And just as composers combine notes 
and phrases to form pieces of music, choreographers string these gestures 
together with new movements to form expressive combinations. Working alongside the orchestra’s 
live score, ballerinas precisely perform these 
combinations to convey narrative, emotion, and character. In "The Sleeping Beauty’s" opening scene, a flurry of techniques depicts 
the fairy court bestowing gifts on baby Princess Aurora. The Fairy of Generosity 
delicately walks “en pointe”— meaning on the tips of her toes— in step with the light plucking 
of violins. The ballerina moves in perfect harmony 
with the music, even mimicing the violins’ trill 
with an elegant bourrée. The Fairy of Temperance, bestowing 
the gift of strong will on Aurora, is choreographed as if shooting bolts 
of electricity from her fingers. She bounds across the stage, spinning with quick chaînés 
before decisively jetéing. Some movements are even more literal 
than this. The evil fairy Carabosse curses 
the princess with a lethal “X,” and the benevolent Lilac Fairy 
counters that curse. Of course, the relationship 
between music and movement isn’t always this straightforward. While classical ballet gestures 
often respond to musical elements, the degree to which the dancers 
and orchestra align is another choreographic tool. Some characters and scenes move 
in sync to create rhythmic clarity, while others deliberately diverge 
from the orchestra. Dancers and musicians maintain 
this delicate balance throughout each performance, engaging in a live negotiation 
of speed and rhythm. But prior to the performance, 
a ballet’s most important relationship is between the choreographer 
and the music. Choreographer Marius Petipa 
and composer Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky worked together on every second 
of "The Sleeping Beauty." This is particularly noticeable 
in Princess Aurora’s exuberant entrance on her 16th birthday. Tchaikovsky’s enthusiastic music 
tumbles forward in fits and starts, even cutting short some musical 
phrases to capture her impatience. Petipa choreographs Aurora bouncing 
back and forth with “pas de chat”— French for "cat steps"— 
as she waits for her party to begin. Once the celebration starts,
it’s up to the dancers to deliver on the physical spectacle of performing
these gestures with grace. Aurora has the hardest part of all: 
her famous Rose Adagio. As four suitors vie for her hand, the Princess performs a dizzying array 
of balances, all en pointe. She briefly takes each suitor’s hand, 
but then balances unassisted— a breath-taking display 
of physical strength and skill. However, it’s not just technique 
that carries meaning, but also style and personality. Like an actor delivering their lines, ballerinas can execute their movements
to convey a wide range of emotion. Aurora can be elegant and restrained, throwing her arms in independence 
from her suitors. Or she can be coy and flirtatious,
descending from en pointe with grace and knowing confidence. "The Sleeping Beauty" offers a showcase
for so much of what ballet can do. Its graceful spectacle, 
dramatic physical vocabulary, and enchanting coordination 
of music and movement perfectly reflect the themes 
of this fantastical romance. But ballet isn’t just for epic fairytales. Ballets can be non-narrative 
emotional journeys, experimental deconstructions of form, or pure demonstrations of skill. The artform is always experimenting 
with a centuries old set of rules, making it the perfect medium 
for stories old and new.

A baby cursed at birth. 
A fierce battle of good and evil. A true love awoken with a kiss. Sleeping Beauty is one of the world’s

**Transcript**:
I teach history at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. On February 14, 2018, my school experienced one of the worst
mass school shootings in American history. People want to know what we saw, what I felt. I don't remember everything, but I do remember I went into crisis mode, mother mode. There was no emotion. I lined up the kids, I held up a sign so they could
follow me through the hall, just like a fire drill. I heard shots from one direction. Luckily, we were already
moving in the opposite direction. We made it outside. We made it to safety. I called my mother. "I'm OK." I called my husband. "I'm OK." Then my daughter called, my voice cracked,
and I knew I had to pull myself together. I sat alone in my thoughts, worried about my colleagues and students. We sat there, only understanding
that somehow, Valentine's Day -- We sat there, only understanding
that somehow, Valentine's Day had ended up with our babies dead, and we didn't know what to do next. It's been two months, and every day I still hear the echoes
of the "pop, pop" sound of the gunfire. I remember the fearful faces
of my students when we knew it wasn't a drill. Still, there's no constant emotion, except for flashes
of pain, grief and anger triggered by the news, or an insensitive comment, or just silence. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School
lost 17 precious lives on that horrible day. After, students asked us, the adults the hardest question: How can we stop the senseless violence? This was the most difficult
question I've been asked. But it was not the first time
I've been humbled by a student's question. I've been teaching
in the public schools for 33 years, so I know you have to admit
what you don't know before you can share what you do know. In fact, there's a method
to being an engaged student, teacher, citizen. First, listen closely
to the person asking you a question. Second, admit your vulnerability.
Admit what you don't know. Third, do your homework. Fourth, humbly share your knowledge. I know all about this process. My students ask really
thoughtful questions all the time. They're eager to learn, and sometimes they're eager
to prove their smarts. And believe me, they know
when I have no idea of the answer, so in those instances, I say to them, "That's a great question.
Let me research that and get back to you." So when my students asked, "How do we stop this senseless violence?" I listened, and then I admitted, "I don't know." And like I always do when I don't know
the answer to one of my questions, I began doing my homework. And as a history teacher, I knew I needed to start
with the Second Amendment and the NRA. In case it's been a while since
you've been sitting in a history class, here is what the Second Amendment actually says: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary
to the security of a free State, the right of the people
to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Meaning, the federal government could not
infringe on the rights of citizens to participate in well-regulated militias. The Second Amendment
was ratified 226 years ago. It was written in a time before
the federal government's armed forces were among the most powerful in the world and when state militias were viewed
as necessary to protect the states. Fast-forward 80 years, to 1871. The American Civil War
had ended a few years prior, but a couple of Union officers had witnessed some pretty shoddy
marksmanship on the battlefield. So in an attempt to prepare their men
for any future conflicts, they founded the National
Rifle Association to promote rifle practice. In short, the Second Amendment
was written to ensure that our newly formed and fragile country had access to organized state militias. And the NRA's original mission was
to ensure future soldiers had good aim. Someone could teach an entire course on how the next 150 years influenced
the gun regulation conversations we're having in the United States and our interpretation
of the Second Amendment. Almost every pivotal moment
in our nation's history in one way or another influenced how we as a people manufacture, debate,
regulate and feel about guns. A lot of change has occurred. As a matter of fact, it wasn't until 2008 that the Supreme Court
ruled for the first time the Second Amendment protects
an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm
for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Within the home. This change over time is striking to me, because it reminds us that the interpretation
of the Second Amendment and cultural attitudes about guns have changed over time. Which gives me hope
they could change again. (Applause) It's an incredibly complex
and dynamic history lesson, but it's not the lesson
I'm here to teach today, because we don't have time. I'm not talking about time, the time that I have here
to stand and speak. I'm talking about the fact
we don't have time to lose. According to the CDC, over the last five years, on average, each day 96 people
are killed by guns in the United States, and if we don't figure out how to answer
my students' question soon, one of us could be next. So, if the question is,
how do we stop this senseless violence, the best way I can think to answer is to look at multiple choice. You remember multiple-choice
questions in high school, don't you? Let's start. Choice A: this will end when we
hold gun manufacturers responsible for the deadliness of their products. It might surprise you to learn that we've
actually thought about this before. Between 1998 and 2000, 30 counties and cities
sued gun manufacturers, saying they should
make their products safer and do a better job of tracking
where their products are sold. In response, manufacturers argued that they had no direct liability
for how their products were used. They said the stores who sold the guns
and the owners who bought them were responsible
should anything bad happen. In response to this
and many other lawsuits, the NRA lobbied
for the passage of the PLCAA, the Protection of Lawful
Commerce in Arms Act. The PLCAA passed
with bipartisan support in 2005 and entrusts gun manufacturers to design guns safely, stores to sell those guns responsibly and someone to own
and use the gun responsibly. And so when 17 students
and faculty die at my school, no one in this chain
will assume responsibility. Let's take a look at another option, Choice B: this will end when we
hold ourselves accountable and regulate the estimated
300 million guns available in America. Yes, voting is one of the best ways to take personal responsibility
for gun violence. Making sure that our lawmakers
are willing to pass commonsense gun reform is one of the most effective ways to get
those 300 million guns under control. And also, gun owners
can take personal initiative. If you own a gun, ask yourself: Do I have an extra gun I don't need? Could it fall into the wrong hands? Have I attended the latest training? Perhaps as a gun owner, you should also ask whether you have been
taking care of your mental health? When it comes to gun violence,
the mental health argument falls flat if we don't acknowledge
our own personal vulnerabilities to mental illness. One in six Americans
will struggle with mental illness. If we own a gun, we should be
rigorously engaged in the upkeep of our emotional well-being so we don't pull a trigger in times of illness. Otherwise, we should
seriously ask ourselves whether we really have the time
and attention to own a gun. Perhaps for some of us it's time to lay down our arms. Then we have Choice C: this will end when we do a better job
of taking care of each other. Many social issues affect
why people buy and use guns. Sixty-two percent of US gun fatalities between 2012 and 2016 were suicides, yet we call people maniacs
and psychos, shaming them. We are creating barriers
for people that need help. Why are we embarrassing each other? Let's make it easier, not harder, for people to access
better mental health care. What else? Sexism, racism
and poverty affect gun ownership and gun-related fatalities. On average, it's estimated that 50 women
were fatally shot each month between 2010 and 2014 due to domestic violence, and women are still dying in their homes. Let's empower women and give our young boys a chance to learn how to work out their conflicts
and emotions with words, not weapons. And the "Washington Post"
reported that last year, nearly 1,000 people were fatally wounded by on-duty police officers. Talk to Black Lives Matter
and the police union about that. We need to tackle this. (Applause) At the end of the day, perhaps people won't feel the need to buy and use a gun when they all equally feel safe, healthy, respected and cared for. All right, discussion time is over. It's now time to answer the question. How do we stop this senseless violence? Is it Choice A, Choice B, Choice C? Now, I know what you're all thinking. You remember that
multiple-choice questions almost never end
with just three possibilities. There's always that fourth,
Choice D: all of the above. Maybe that's the answer here. Or maybe "all of the above" is too easy,
and this is not an easy problem. It requires deep analytical
thinking by all of us. So instead, I'm asking you
to do your homework, write your own Choice D using supporting detail. And if you're not sure where to start,
look to my students as role models. They are armed with incredible
communication skills and a sense of citizenship
that I find so inspiring. (Applause) These are public school kids
engaged in the issue of gun regulation, and their endeavor has moved our hearts. And they shouldn't have
to do this on their own. They're asking you, they're asking all of us, to get involved. This isn't a spectator sport. So what's the right answer? I don't know. Listen,
I'm no gun control expert. I teach the humanities. To be human is to learn, and to be part of a civilization
is to share your knowledge. This kind of honest,
brave and sincere engagement is what I ask of my students, what I expect of myself as a teacher and what I demand of you now. Every one of you
needs to do your homework. And then what? Humbly share your knowledge
with each other. Please teach your family, teach your community, your city council, your state legislature. Teach Congress a lesson. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

regulate and feel about guns. A lot of change has occurred. As a matter of fact, it wasn't until 2008 that the Supreme Court
ruled for the first time the Second Amendment protects
an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm
for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Within the home. This change over time is striking to me, because it reminds us that the interpretation
of the Second Amendment and cultural attitudes about guns have changed over time. Which gives me hope
they could change again. (Applause) It's an incredibly complex
and dynamic history lesson, but it's not the lesson
I'm here to teach today, because we don't have time. I'm not talking about time, the time that I have here
to stand and speak. I'm talking about the fact
we don't have time to lose. According to the CDC, over the last five years, on average, each day 96 people
are killed by guns in the United States, and if we don't figure out how to answer
my students' question soon, one of us could be next. So, if the question is,
how do we stop this senseless violence, the best way I can think to answer is to look at multiple choice. You remember multiple-choice
questions in high school, don't you? Let's start. Choice A: this will end when we
hold gun manufacturers responsible for the deadliness of their products. It might surprise you to learn that we've
actually thought about this before. Between 1998 and 2000, 30 counties and cities
sued gun manufacturers, saying they should
make their products safer and do a better job of tracking
where their products are sold. In response, manufacturers argued that they had no direct liability
for how their products were used. They said the stores who sold the guns
and the owners who bought them were responsible
should anything bad happen. In response to this
and many other lawsuits, the NRA lobbied
for the passage of the PLCAA, the Protection of Lawful
Commerce in Arms Act. The PLCAA passed
with bipartisan support in 2005 and entrusts gun manufacturers to design guns safely, stores to sell those guns responsibly and someone to own
and use the gun responsibly. And so when 17 students
and faculty die at my school, no one in this chain
will assume responsibility. Let's take a look at another option, Choice B: this will end when we
hold ourselves accountable and regulate the estimated
300 million guns available in America. Yes, voting is one of the best ways to take personal responsibility
for gun violence. Making sure that our lawmakers
are willing to pass commonsense gun reform is one of the most effective ways to get
those 300 million guns under control. And also, gun owners
can take personal initiative. If you own a gun, ask yourself: Do I have an extra gun I don't need? Could it fall into the wrong hands? Have I attended the latest training? Perhaps as a gun owner, you should also ask whether you have been
taking care of your mental health? When it comes to gun violence,
the mental health argument falls flat if we don't acknowledge
our own personal vulnerabilities to mental illness. One in six Americans
will struggle with mental illness. If we own a gun, we should be
rigorously engaged in the upkeep of our emotional well-being so we don't pull a trigger in times of illness. Otherwise, we should
seriously ask ourselves whether we really have the time
and attention to own a gun. Perhaps for some of us it's time to lay down our arms. Then we have Choice C: this will end when we do a better job
of taking care of each other. Many social issues affect
why people buy and use guns. Sixty-two percent of US gun fatalities between 2012 and 2016 were suicides, yet we call people maniacs
and psychos, shaming them. We are creating barriers
for people that need help. Why are we embarrassing each other? Let's make it easier, not harder, for people to access
better mental health care. What else? Sexism, racism
and poverty affect gun ownership and gun-related fatalities. On average, it's estimated that 50 women
were fatally shot each month between 2010 and 2014 due to domestic violence, and women are still dying in their homes. Let's empower women and give our young boys a chance to learn how to work out their conflicts
and emotions with words, not weapons. And the "Washington Post"
reported that last year, nearly 1,000 people were fatally wounded by on-duty police officers. Talk to Black Lives Matter
and the police union about that. We need to tackle this. (Applause) At the end of the day, perhaps people won't feel the need to buy and use a gun when they all equally feel safe, healthy, respected and cared for. All right, discussion time is over. It's now time to answer the question. How do we stop this senseless violence? Is it Choice A, Choice B, Choice C? Now, I know what you're all thinking. You remember that
multiple-choice questions almost never end
with just three possibilities. There's always that fourth,
Choice D: all of the above. Maybe that's the answer here. Or maybe "all of the above" is too easy,
and this is not an easy problem. It requires deep analytical
thinking by all of us. So instead, I'm asking you
to do your homework, write your own Choice D using supporting detail. And if you're not sure where to start,
look to my students as role models. They are armed with incredible
communication skills and a sense of citizenship
that I find so inspiring. (Applause) These are public school kids
engaged in the issue of gun regulation, and their endeavor has moved our hearts. And they shouldn't have
to do this on their own. They're asking you, they're asking all of us, to get involved. This isn't a spectator sport. So what's the right answer? I don't know. Listen,
I'm no gun control expert. I teach the humanities. To be human is to learn, and to be part of a civilization
is to share your knowledge. This kind of honest,
brave and sincere engagement is what I ask of my students, what I expect of myself as a teacher and what I demand of you now. Every one of you
needs to do your homework. And then what? Humbly share your knowledge
with each other. Please teach your family, teach your community, your city council, your state legislature. Teach Congress a lesson. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I teach history at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. On February 14, 2018, my school experienced one of the worst
mass school shootings in American history. People want to know what we saw, what I felt. I don't remember everything, but I do remember I went into crisis mode, mother mode. There was no emotion. I lined up the kids, I held up a sign so they could
follow me through the hall, just like a fire drill. I heard shots from one direction. Luckily, we were already
moving in the opposite direction. We made it outside. We made it to safety. I called my mother. "I'm OK." I called my husband. "I'm OK." Then my daughter called, my voice cracked,
and I knew I had to pull myself together. I sat alone in my thoughts, worried about my colleagues and students. We sat there, only understanding
that somehow, Valentine's Day -- We sat there, only understanding
that somehow, Valentine's Day had ended up with our babies dead, and we didn't know what to do next. It's been two months, and every day I still hear the echoes
of the "pop, pop" sound of the gunfire. I remember the fearful faces
of my students when we knew it wasn't a drill. Still, there's no constant emotion, except for flashes
of pain, grief and anger triggered by the news, or an insensitive comment, or just silence. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School
lost 17 precious lives on that horrible day. After, students asked us, the adults the hardest question: How can we stop the senseless violence? This was the most difficult
question I've been asked. But it was not the first time
I've been humbled by a student's question. I've been teaching
in the public schools for 33 years, so I know you have to admit
what you don't know before you can share what you do know. In fact, there's a method
to being an engaged student, teacher, citizen. First, listen closely
to the person asking you a question. Second, admit your vulnerability.
Admit what you don't know. Third, do your homework. Fourth, humbly share your knowledge. I know all about this process. My students ask really
thoughtful questions all the time. They're eager to learn, and sometimes they're eager
to prove their smarts. And believe me, they know
when I have no idea of the answer, so in those instances, I say to them, "That's a great question.
Let me research that and get back to you." So when my students asked, "How do we stop this senseless violence?" I listened, and then I admitted, "I don't know." And like I always do when I don't know
the answer to one of my questions, I began doing my homework. And as a history teacher, I knew I needed to start
with the Second Amendment and the NRA. In case it's been a while since
you've been sitting in a history class, here is what the Second Amendment actually says: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary
to the security of a free State, the right of the people
to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Meaning, the federal government could not
infringe on the rights of citizens to participate in well-regulated militias. The Second Amendment
was ratified 226 years ago. It was written in a time before
the federal government's armed forces were among the most powerful in the world and when state militias were viewed
as necessary to protect the states. Fast-forward 80 years, to 1871. The American Civil War
had ended a few years prior, but a couple of Union officers had witnessed some pretty shoddy
marksmanship on the battlefield. So in an attempt to prepare their men
for any future conflicts, they founded the National
Rifle Association to promote rifle practice. In short, the Second Amendment
was written to ensure that our newly formed and fragile country had access to organized state militias. And the NRA's original mission was
to ensure future soldiers had good aim. Someone could teach an entire course on how the next 150 years influenced
the gun regulation conversations we're having in the United States and our interpretation
of the Second Amendment. Almost every pivotal moment
in our nation's history in one way or another influenced how we as a people manufacture, debate,
regulate and feel about guns. A lot of change has occurred. As a matter of fact, it wasn't until 2008 that the Supreme Court
ruled for the first time the Second Amendment protects
an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm
for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Within the home. This change over time is striking to me, because it reminds us that the interpretation
of the Second Amendment and cultural attitudes about guns have changed over time. Which gives me hope
they could change again. (Applause) It's an incredibly complex
and dynamic history lesson, but it's not the lesson

**Transcript**:
I grew up with my identical twin, who was an incredibly loving brother. Now, one thing about being a twin is, it makes you an expert
at spotting favoritism. If his cookie was even
slightly bigger than my cookie, I had questions. And clearly, I wasn't starving. (Laughter) When I became a psychologist,
I began to notice favoritism of a different kind; and that is, how much more we value
the body than we do the mind. I spent nine years at university
earning my doctorate in psychology, and I can't tell you how many people
look at my business card and say, "Oh -- a psychologist.
So, not a real doctor," as if it should say that on my card. [Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist
(Not a Real Doctor)] (Laughter) This favoritism we show the body
over the mind -- I see it everywhere. I recently was at a friend's house, and their five-year-old
was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool
by the sink, brushing his teeth, when he slipped and scratched his leg
on the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute,
but then he got back up, got back on the stool, and reached out
for a box of Band-Aids to put one on his cut. Now, this kid could barely
tie his shoelaces, but he knew you have to cover a cut
so it doesn't become infected, and you have to care for your teeth
by brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain
our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene, right? We've known it since
we were five years old. But what do we know about maintaining
our psychological health? Well, nothing. What do we teach our children
about emotional hygiene? Nothing. How is it that we spend more time
taking care of our teeth than we do our minds? Why is it that our physical health
is so much more important to us than our psychological health? We sustain psychological injuries
even more often than we do physical ones, injuries like failure
or rejection or loneliness. And they can also get worse
if we ignore them, and they can impact our lives
in dramatic ways. And yet, even though there are
scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these
kinds of psychological injuries, we don't. It doesn't even occur to us
that we should. "Oh, you're feeling depressed?
Just shake it off; it's all in your head." Can you imagine saying that
to somebody with a broken leg: "Oh, just walk it off;
it's all in your leg." (Laughter) It is time we closed the gap between our physical
and our psychological health. It's time we made them more equal, more like twins. Speaking of which,
my brother is also a psychologist. So he's not a real doctor, either. (Laughter) We didn't study together, though. In fact, the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic
to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology. We were apart then
for the first time in our lives, and the separation was brutal
for both of us. But while he remained
among family and friends, I was alone in a new country. We missed each other terribly, but international phone calls
were really expensive then, and we could only afford to speak
for five minutes a week. When our birthday rolled around, it was the first
we wouldn't be spending together. We decided to splurge, and that week,
we would talk for 10 minutes. (Laughter) I spent the morning pacing around my room,
waiting for him to call -- and waiting ... and waiting. But the phone didn't ring. Given the time difference, I assumed, "OK, he's out with friends,
he'll call later." There were no cell phones then. But he didn't. And I began to realize
that after being away for over 10 months, he no longer missed me
the way I missed him. I knew he would call in the morning, but that night was one of the saddest
and longest nights of my life. I woke up the next morning. I glanced down at the phone, and I realized
I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before. I stumbled out of bed, I put the phone back on the receiver,
and it rang a second later. And it was my brother, and boy, was he pissed. (Laughter) It was the saddest and longest
night of his life as well. Now, I tried to explain
what happened, but he said, "I don't understand. If you saw I wasn't calling you, why didn't you just pick up
the phone and call me?" He was right. Why didn't I call him? I didn't have an answer then. But I do today, and it's a simple one: loneliness. Loneliness creates a deep
psychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions
and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us
care much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out, because why set yourself up
for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching
more than you can stand? I was in the grips
of real loneliness back then, but I was surrounded by people all day,
so it never occurred to me. But loneliness is defined
purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel
emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you. And I did. There is a lot of research on loneliness,
and all of it is horrifying. Loneliness won't just make you miserable; it will kill you. I'm not kidding. Chronic loneliness increases
your likelihood of an early death by 14 percent. Fourteen percent! Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning
of your immune system, making you vulnerable to all kinds
of illnesses and diseases. In fact, scientists have concluded
that taken together, chronic loneliness
poses as significant a risk for your long-term health and longevity as cigarette smoking. Now, cigarette packs come with warnings
saying, "This could kill you." But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize
our psychological health, that we practice emotional hygiene. Because you can't treat
a psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured. Loneliness isn't the only
psychological wound that distorts our perceptions
and misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center, where I saw three toddlers
play with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling
the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back
and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her
watched this happen, then turned to his box and burst
into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight. So: three toddlers
with identical plastic toys, but with very different
reactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented
them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them
into believing they could not. Now, adults get tricked this way
as well, all the time. In fact, we all have a default set
of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever
we encounter frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how
your mind reacts to failure? You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you
you're incapable of something, and you believe it, then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon,
or you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more
convinced you can't succeed. You see, that's why so many people
function below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way,
sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't
succeed, and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something,
it's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way
when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends
down a dark road at night, when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area
and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car,
and shined his flashlight on the driver, then on my brother in the front seat, and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said, "Where have I seen your face before?" (Laughter) And I said, "In the front seat." (Laughter) But that made no sense to him whatsoever, so now he thought I was on drugs. (Laughter) So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me, he marches me over to the police car, and only when he verified
I didn't have a police record, could I show him
I had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away, you could see by the look
on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. (Laughter) Our mind is hard to change
once we become convinced. So it might be very natural
to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself
to become convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight
feelings of helplessness. You have to gain control
over the situation. And you have to break
this kind of negative cycle before it begins. [Stop Emotional Bleeding] Our minds and our feelings -- they're not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were. They're more like a really moody friend, who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman
who, after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online, and he seemed nice
and he seemed successful, and most importantly,
he seemed really into her. So she was very excited,
she bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date,
the man stands up and says, "I'm not interested," and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said:
"Well, what do you expect? You have big hips,
you have nothing interesting to say. Why would a handsome,
successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you?" Shocking, right, that a friend
could be so cruel? But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't
the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do, especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults
and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were,
what we wish we weren't. We call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do, because our self-esteem
is already hurting. Why would we want to go
and damage it even further? We wouldn't make a physical injury
worse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm
and decide, "Oh! I know -- I'm going to take a knife and see
how much deeper I can make it." But we do that with psychological
injuries all the time. Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize
our psychological health. We know from dozens of studies
that when your self-esteem is lower, you are more vulnerable
to stress and to anxiety; that failures and rejections hurt more, and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected,
the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self-esteem, not join Fight Club
and beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain, treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend. [Protect Your Self-Esteem] We have to catch our unhealthy
psychological habits and change them. And one of unhealthiest and most common
is called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you or your professor
makes you feel stupid in class, or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying
the scene in your head for days, sometimes for weeks on end. Now, ruminating about upsetting events
in this way can easily become a habit, and it's a very costly one, because by spending so much time focused
on upsetting and negative thoughts, you are actually putting yourself
at significant risk for developing clinical depression, alcoholism, eating disorders, and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is, the urge to ruminate can feel
really strong and really important, so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact, because a little over a year ago,
I developed the habit myself. You see, my twin brother was diagnosed
with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremely aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course
of chemotherapy. And I couldn't stop thinking
about what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking
about how much he was suffering, even though he never complained, not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy,
but psychologically, I was a mess. But I knew what to do. Studies tell us that even a two-minute
distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate
in that moment. And so each time I had a worrying,
upsetting, negative thought, I forced myself to concentrate
on something else until the urge passed. And within one week,
my whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful. [Battle Negative Thinking] Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
my brother had a CAT scan, and I was by his side
when he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds
of chemotherapy to go, but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely, by changing your responses to failure, by protecting your self-esteem, by battling negative thinking, you won't just heal
your psychological wounds, you will build emotional resilience, you will thrive. A hundred years ago, people began
practicing personal hygiene, and life expectancy rates
rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life
could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing
emotional hygiene. Can you imagine
what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier? If there were less loneliness
and less depression? If people knew how to overcome failure? If they felt better about themselves
and more empowered? If they were happier and more fulfilled? I can, because that's the world
I want to live in. And that's the world
my brother wants to live in as well. And if you just become informed
and change a few simple habits, well -- that's the world we can all live in. Thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I grew up with my identical twin, who was an incredibly loving brother. Now, one thing about being a twin is, it makes you an expert
at spotting favoritism. If his cookie was even
slightly bigger than my cookie, I had questions. And clearly, I wasn't starving. (Laughter) When I became a psychologist,
I began to notice favoritism of a different kind; and that is, how much more we value
the body than we do the mind. I spent nine years at university
earning my doctorate in psychology, and I can't tell you how many people
look at my business card and say, "Oh -- a psychologist.
So, not a real doctor," as if it should say that on my card. [Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist
(Not a Real Doctor)] (Laughter) This favoritism we show the body
over the mind -- I see it everywhere. I recently was at a friend's house, and their five-year-old
was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool
by the sink, brushing his teeth, when he slipped and scratched his leg
on the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute,
but then he got back up, got back on the stool, and reached out
for a box of Band-Aids to put one on his cut. Now, this kid could barely
tie his shoelaces, but he knew you have to cover a cut
so it doesn't become infected, and you have to care for your teeth
by brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain
our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene, right? We've known it since
we were five years old. But what do we know about maintaining
our psychological health? Well, nothing. What do we teach our children
about emotional hygiene? Nothing. How is it that we spend more time
taking care of our teeth than we do our minds? Why is it that our physical health
is so much more important to us than our psychological health? We sustain psychological injuries
even more often than we do physical ones, injuries like failure
or rejection or loneliness. And they can also get worse
if we ignore them, and they can impact our lives
in dramatic ways. And yet, even though there are
scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these
kinds of psychological injuries, we don't. It doesn't even occur to us
that we should. "Oh, you're feeling depressed?
Just shake it off; it's all in your head." Can you imagine saying that
to somebody with a broken leg: "Oh, just walk it off;
it's all in your leg." (Laughter) It is time we closed the gap between our physical
and our psychological health. It's time we made them more equal, more like twins. Speaking of which,
my brother is also a psychologist. So he's not a real doctor, either. (Laughter) We didn't study together, though. In fact, the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic
to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology. We were apart then
for the first time in our lives, and the separation was brutal
for both of us. But while he remained
among family and friends, I was alone in a new country. We missed each other terribly, but international phone calls
were really expensive then, and we could only afford to speak
for five minutes a week. When our birthday rolled around, it was the first
we wouldn't be spending together. We decided to splurge, and that week,
we would talk for 10 minutes. (Laughter) I spent the morning pacing around my room,
waiting for him to call -- and waiting ... and waiting. But the phone didn't ring. Given the time difference, I assumed, "OK, he's out with friends,
he'll call later." There were no cell phones then. But he didn't. And I began to realize
that after being away for over 10 months, he no longer missed me
the way I missed him. I knew he would call in the morning, but that night was one of the saddest
and longest nights of my life. I woke up the next morning. I glanced down at the phone, and I realized
I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before. I stumbled out of bed, I put the phone back on the receiver,
and it rang a second later. And it was my brother, and boy, was he pissed. (Laughter) It was the saddest and longest
night of his life as well. Now, I tried to explain
what happened, but he said, "I don't understand. If you saw I wasn't calling you, why didn't you just pick up
the phone and call me?" He was right. Why didn't I call him? I didn't have an answer then. But I do today, and it's a simple one: loneliness. Loneliness creates a deep
psychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions
and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us
care much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out, because why set yourself up
for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching
more than you can stand? I was in the grips
of real loneliness back then, but I was surrounded by people all day,
so it never occurred to me. But loneliness is defined
purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel
emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you. And I did. There is a lot of research on loneliness,
and all of it is horrifying. Loneliness won't just make you miserable; it will kill you. I'm not kidding. Chronic loneliness increases
your likelihood of an early death by 14 percent. Fourteen percent! Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning
of your immune system, making you vulnerable to all kinds
of illnesses and diseases. In fact, scientists have concluded
that taken together, chronic loneliness
poses as significant a risk for your long-term health and longevity as cigarette smoking. Now, cigarette packs come with warnings
saying, "This could kill you." But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize
our psychological health, that we practice emotional hygiene. Because you can't treat
a psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured. Loneliness isn't the only
psychological wound that distorts our perceptions
and misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center, where I saw three toddlers
play with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling
the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back
and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her
watched this happen, then turned to his box and burst
into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight. So: three toddlers
with identical plastic toys, but with very different
reactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented
them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them
into believing they could not. Now, adults get tricked this way
as well, all the time. In fact, we all have a default set
of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever
we encounter frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how
your mind reacts to failure? You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you
you're incapable of something, and you believe it, then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon,
or you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more
convinced you can't succeed. You see, that's why so many people
function below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way,
sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't
succeed, and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something,
it's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way
when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends
down a dark road at night, when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area
and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car,
and shined his flashlight on the driver, then on my brother in the front seat, and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said, "Where have I seen your face before?" (Laughter) And I said, "In the front seat." (Laughter) But that made no sense to him whatsoever, so now he thought I was on drugs. (Laughter) So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me, he marches me over to the police car, and only when he verified
I didn't have a police record, could I show him
I had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away, you could see by the look
on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. (Laughter) Our mind is hard to change
once we become convinced. So it might be very natural
to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself
to become convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight
feelings of helplessness. You have to gain control
over the situation. And you have to break
this kind of negative cycle before it begins. [Stop Emotional Bleeding] Our minds and our feelings -- they're not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were. They're more like a really moody friend, who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman
who, after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online, and he seemed nice
and he seemed successful, and most importantly,
he seemed really into her. So she was very excited,
she bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date,
the man stands up and says, "I'm not interested," and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said:
"Well, what do you expect? You have big hips,

and misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center, where I saw three toddlers
play with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling
the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back
and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her
watched this happen, then turned to his box and burst
into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight. So: three toddlers
with identical plastic toys, but with very different
reactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented
them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them
into believing they could not. Now, adults get tricked this way
as well, all the time. In fact, we all have a default set
of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever
we encounter frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how
your mind reacts to failure? You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you
you're incapable of something, and you believe it, then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon,
or you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more
convinced you can't succeed. You see, that's why so many people
function below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way,
sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't
succeed, and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something,
it's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way
when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends
down a dark road at night, when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area
and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car,
and shined his flashlight on the driver, then on my brother in the front seat, and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said, "Where have I seen your face before?" (Laughter) And I said, "In the front seat." (Laughter) But that made no sense to him whatsoever, so now he thought I was on drugs. (Laughter) So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me, he marches me over to the police car, and only when he verified
I didn't have a police record, could I show him
I had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away, you could see by the look
on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. (Laughter) Our mind is hard to change
once we become convinced. So it might be very natural
to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself
to become convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight
feelings of helplessness. You have to gain control
over the situation. And you have to break
this kind of negative cycle before it begins. [Stop Emotional Bleeding] Our minds and our feelings -- they're not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were. They're more like a really moody friend, who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman
who, after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online, and he seemed nice
and he seemed successful, and most importantly,
he seemed really into her. So she was very excited,
she bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date,
the man stands up and says, "I'm not interested," and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said:
"Well, what do you expect? You have big hips,
you have nothing interesting to say. Why would a handsome,
successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you?" Shocking, right, that a friend
could be so cruel? But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't
the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do, especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults
and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were,
what we wish we weren't. We call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do, because our self-esteem
is already hurting. Why would we want to go
and damage it even further? We wouldn't make a physical injury
worse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm
and decide, "Oh! I know -- I'm going to take a knife and see
how much deeper I can make it." But we do that with psychological
injuries all the time. Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize
our psychological health. We know from dozens of studies
that when your self-esteem is lower, you are more vulnerable
to stress and to anxiety; that failures and rejections hurt more, and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected,
the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self-esteem, not join Fight Club
and beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain, treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend. [Protect Your Self-Esteem] We have to catch our unhealthy
psychological habits and change them. And one of unhealthiest and most common
is called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you or your professor
makes you feel stupid in class, or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying
the scene in your head for days, sometimes for weeks on end. Now, ruminating about upsetting events
in this way can easily become a habit, and it's a very costly one, because by spending so much time focused
on upsetting and negative thoughts, you are actually putting yourself
at significant risk for developing clinical depression, alcoholism, eating disorders, and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is, the urge to ruminate can feel
really strong and really important, so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact, because a little over a year ago,
I developed the habit myself. You see, my twin brother was diagnosed
with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremely aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course
of chemotherapy. And I couldn't stop thinking
about what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking
about how much he was suffering, even though he never complained, not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy,
but psychologically, I was a mess. But I knew what to do. Studies tell us that even a two-minute
distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate
in that moment. And so each time I had a worrying,
upsetting, negative thought, I forced myself to concentrate
on something else until the urge passed. And within one week,
my whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful. [Battle Negative Thinking] Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
my brother had a CAT scan, and I was by his side
when he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds
of chemotherapy to go, but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely, by changing your responses to failure, by protecting your self-esteem, by battling negative thinking, you won't just heal
your psychological wounds, you will build emotional resilience, you will thrive. A hundred years ago, people began
practicing personal hygiene, and life expectancy rates
rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life
could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing
emotional hygiene. Can you imagine
what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier? If there were less loneliness
and less depression? If people knew how to overcome failure? If they felt better about themselves
and more empowered? If they were happier and more fulfilled? I can, because that's the world
I want to live in. And that's the world
my brother wants to live in as well. And if you just become informed
and change a few simple habits, well -- that's the world we can all live in. Thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I grew up with my identical twin, who was an incredibly loving brother. Now, one thing about being a twin is, it makes you an expert
at spotting favoritism. If his cookie was even
slightly bigger than my cookie, I had questions. And clearly, I wasn't starving. (Laughter) When I became a psychologist,
I began to notice favoritism of a different kind; and that is, how much more we value
the body than we do the mind. I spent nine years at university
earning my doctorate in psychology, and I can't tell you how many people
look at my business card and say, "Oh -- a psychologist.
So, not a real doctor," as if it should say that on my card. [Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist
(Not a Real Doctor)] (Laughter) This favoritism we show the body
over the mind -- I see it everywhere. I recently was at a friend's house, and their five-year-old
was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool
by the sink, brushing his teeth, when he slipped and scratched his leg
on the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute,
but then he got back up, got back on the stool, and reached out
for a box of Band-Aids to put one on his cut. Now, this kid could barely
tie his shoelaces, but he knew you have to cover a cut
so it doesn't become infected, and you have to care for your teeth
by brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain
our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene, right? We've known it since
we were five years old. But what do we know about maintaining
our psychological health? Well, nothing. What do we teach our children
about emotional hygiene? Nothing. How is it that we spend more time
taking care of our teeth than we do our minds? Why is it that our physical health
is so much more important to us than our psychological health? We sustain psychological injuries
even more often than we do physical ones, injuries like failure
or rejection or loneliness. And they can also get worse
if we ignore them, and they can impact our lives
in dramatic ways. And yet, even though there are
scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these
kinds of psychological injuries, we don't. It doesn't even occur to us
that we should. "Oh, you're feeling depressed?
Just shake it off; it's all in your head." Can you imagine saying that
to somebody with a broken leg: "Oh, just walk it off;
it's all in your leg." (Laughter) It is time we closed the gap between our physical
and our psychological health. It's time we made them more equal, more like twins. Speaking of which,
my brother is also a psychologist. So he's not a real doctor, either. (Laughter) We didn't study together, though. In fact, the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic
to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology. We were apart then
for the first time in our lives, and the separation was brutal
for both of us. But while he remained
among family and friends, I was alone in a new country. We missed each other terribly, but international phone calls
were really expensive then, and we could only afford to speak
for five minutes a week. When our birthday rolled around, it was the first
we wouldn't be spending together. We decided to splurge, and that week,
we would talk for 10 minutes. (Laughter) I spent the morning pacing around my room,
waiting for him to call -- and waiting ... and waiting. But the phone didn't ring. Given the time difference, I assumed, "OK, he's out with friends,
he'll call later." There were no cell phones then. But he didn't. And I began to realize
that after being away for over 10 months, he no longer missed me
the way I missed him. I knew he would call in the morning, but that night was one of the saddest
and longest nights of my life. I woke up the next morning. I glanced down at the phone, and I realized
I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before. I stumbled out of bed, I put the phone back on the receiver,
and it rang a second later. And it was my brother, and boy, was he pissed. (Laughter) It was the saddest and longest
night of his life as well. Now, I tried to explain
what happened, but he said, "I don't understand. If you saw I wasn't calling you, why didn't you just pick up
the phone and call me?" He was right. Why didn't I call him? I didn't have an answer then. But I do today, and it's a simple one: loneliness. Loneliness creates a deep
psychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions
and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us
care much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out, because why set yourself up
for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching
more than you can stand? I was in the grips
of real loneliness back then, but I was surrounded by people all day,
so it never occurred to me. But loneliness is defined
purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel
emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you. And I did. There is a lot of research on loneliness,
and all of it is horrifying. Loneliness won't just make you miserable; it will kill you. I'm not kidding. Chronic loneliness increases
your likelihood of an early death by 14 percent. Fourteen percent! Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning
of your immune system, making you vulnerable to all kinds
of illnesses and diseases. In fact, scientists have concluded
that taken together, chronic loneliness
poses as significant a risk for your long-term health and longevity as cigarette smoking. Now, cigarette packs come with warnings
saying, "This could kill you." But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize
our psychological health, that we practice emotional hygiene. Because you can't treat
a psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured. Loneliness isn't the only
psychological wound that distorts our perceptions
and misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center, where I saw three toddlers
play with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling
the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back
and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her
watched this happen, then turned to his box and burst
into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight. So: three toddlers

we would talk for 10 minutes. (Laughter) I spent the morning pacing around my room,
waiting for him to call -- and waiting ... and waiting. But the phone didn't ring. Given the time difference, I assumed, "OK, he's out with friends,
he'll call later." There were no cell phones then. But he didn't. And I began to realize
that after being away for over 10 months, he no longer missed me
the way I missed him. I knew he would call in the morning, but that night was one of the saddest
and longest nights of my life. I woke up the next morning. I glanced down at the phone, and I realized
I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before. I stumbled out of bed, I put the phone back on the receiver,
and it rang a second later. And it was my brother, and boy, was he pissed. (Laughter) It was the saddest and longest
night of his life as well. Now, I tried to explain
what happened, but he said, "I don't understand. If you saw I wasn't calling you, why didn't you just pick up
the phone and call me?" He was right. Why didn't I call him? I didn't have an answer then. But I do today, and it's a simple one: loneliness. Loneliness creates a deep
psychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions
and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us
care much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out, because why set yourself up
for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching
more than you can stand? I was in the grips
of real loneliness back then, but I was surrounded by people all day,
so it never occurred to me. But loneliness is defined
purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel
emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you. And I did. There is a lot of research on loneliness,
and all of it is horrifying. Loneliness won't just make you miserable; it will kill you. I'm not kidding. Chronic loneliness increases
your likelihood of an early death by 14 percent. Fourteen percent! Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning
of your immune system, making you vulnerable to all kinds
of illnesses and diseases. In fact, scientists have concluded
that taken together, chronic loneliness
poses as significant a risk for your long-term health and longevity as cigarette smoking. Now, cigarette packs come with warnings
saying, "This could kill you." But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize
our psychological health, that we practice emotional hygiene. Because you can't treat
a psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured. Loneliness isn't the only
psychological wound that distorts our perceptions
and misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center, where I saw three toddlers
play with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling
the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back
and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her
watched this happen, then turned to his box and burst
into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight. So: three toddlers
with identical plastic toys, but with very different
reactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented
them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them
into believing they could not. Now, adults get tricked this way
as well, all the time. In fact, we all have a default set
of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever
we encounter frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how
your mind reacts to failure? You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you
you're incapable of something, and you believe it, then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon,
or you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more
convinced you can't succeed. You see, that's why so many people
function below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way,
sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't
succeed, and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something,
it's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way
when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends
down a dark road at night, when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area
and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car,
and shined his flashlight on the driver, then on my brother in the front seat, and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said, "Where have I seen your face before?" (Laughter) And I said, "In the front seat." (Laughter) But that made no sense to him whatsoever, so now he thought I was on drugs. (Laughter) So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me, he marches me over to the police car, and only when he verified
I didn't have a police record, could I show him
I had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away, you could see by the look
on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. (Laughter) Our mind is hard to change
once we become convinced. So it might be very natural
to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself
to become convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight
feelings of helplessness. You have to gain control
over the situation. And you have to break
this kind of negative cycle before it begins. [Stop Emotional Bleeding] Our minds and our feelings -- they're not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were. They're more like a really moody friend, who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman
who, after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online, and he seemed nice
and he seemed successful, and most importantly,
he seemed really into her. So she was very excited,
she bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date,
the man stands up and says, "I'm not interested," and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said:
"Well, what do you expect? You have big hips,
you have nothing interesting to say. Why would a handsome,
successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you?" Shocking, right, that a friend
could be so cruel? But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't
the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do, especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults
and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were,
what we wish we weren't. We call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do, because our self-esteem
is already hurting. Why would we want to go
and damage it even further? We wouldn't make a physical injury
worse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm
and decide, "Oh! I know -- I'm going to take a knife and see
how much deeper I can make it." But we do that with psychological
injuries all the time. Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize
our psychological health. We know from dozens of studies
that when your self-esteem is lower, you are more vulnerable
to stress and to anxiety; that failures and rejections hurt more, and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected,
the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self-esteem, not join Fight Club
and beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain, treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend. [Protect Your Self-Esteem] We have to catch our unhealthy
psychological habits and change them. And one of unhealthiest and most common
is called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you or your professor
makes you feel stupid in class, or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying
the scene in your head for days, sometimes for weeks on end. Now, ruminating about upsetting events
in this way can easily become a habit, and it's a very costly one, because by spending so much time focused
on upsetting and negative thoughts, you are actually putting yourself
at significant risk for developing clinical depression, alcoholism, eating disorders, and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is, the urge to ruminate can feel
really strong and really important, so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact, because a little over a year ago,
I developed the habit myself. You see, my twin brother was diagnosed
with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremely aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course
of chemotherapy. And I couldn't stop thinking
about what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking
about how much he was suffering, even though he never complained, not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy,
but psychologically, I was a mess. But I knew what to do. Studies tell us that even a two-minute
distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate
in that moment. And so each time I had a worrying,
upsetting, negative thought, I forced myself to concentrate
on something else until the urge passed. And within one week,
my whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful. [Battle Negative Thinking] Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
my brother had a CAT scan, and I was by his side
when he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds
of chemotherapy to go, but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely, by changing your responses to failure, by protecting your self-esteem, by battling negative thinking, you won't just heal
your psychological wounds, you will build emotional resilience, you will thrive. A hundred years ago, people began
practicing personal hygiene, and life expectancy rates
rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life
could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing
emotional hygiene. Can you imagine
what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier? If there were less loneliness
and less depression? If people knew how to overcome failure? If they felt better about themselves
and more empowered? If they were happier and more fulfilled? I can, because that's the world
I want to live in. And that's the world
my brother wants to live in as well. And if you just become informed
and change a few simple habits, well -- that's the world we can all live in. Thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress. For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however,
told a very different story. My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win. But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart
in a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement
from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal
snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest
races in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy
an Indian girl was running. But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers
that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating. Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk
about the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story
of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time
in my entire life that I had done something
that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect. And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate
towards careers and professions that they know
they're going to be great in, that they know they're
going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught
to avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars
and then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise
or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated
to take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously
unless you've had two failed start-ups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave. Some people worry
about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society,
we're just losing out because we're not raising
our girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why
women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look. In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders
handled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls
were quick to give up. The higher the IQ,
the more likely they were to give up. Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material
to be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely
to redouble their efforts. What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys
in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys
and girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found
that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent
of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent
of the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked
as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized
to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. (Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take
less risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs
that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy
is being left behind on all the innovation and problems
women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. (Applause) So in 2012, I started a company
to teach girls to code, and what I found
is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process
of trial and error, of trying to get the right command
in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference
between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying
to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher
tells me the same story. During the first week,
when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over
and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write." The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better,
she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes
just staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student
wrote code and then deleted it. She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing
the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust. It turns out that our girls
are really good at coding, but it's not enough
just to teach them to code. My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours
with computer science students. When the guys are struggling
with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with my code." The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with me." We have to begin to undo
the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it
with building a sisterhood that lets girls know
that they are not alone. Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me, "I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network
cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. Take, for instance,
two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love
for her new country by building an app
to help Americans get to the polls. Or a 16-year-old girl
who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer
is benign or malignant in the off chance
that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just
three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been
socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying,
who have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams. And those dreams have never been
more important for our country. For the American economy,
for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind
half our population. We have to socialize our girls
to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them
to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. We have to teach them
to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential
to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them
that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you
to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece,
your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach
girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement
of young women who are brave and who will build
a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have.
You have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls
are involved now in your program? Reshma Saujani: Yeah.
So in 2012, we taught 20 girls. This year we'll teach 40,000
in all 50 states. (Applause) And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated
7,500 women in computer science. Like, the problem is so bad that we can make
that type of change quickly. CA: And you're working with some
of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming
graduates from your program? RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. And if you're not signed up,
I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code
classroom in their office. CA: And you have some stories
back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams,
good things happen. RS: Great things happen. I mean, I think that it's crazy to me
to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all
consumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate
of 600 percent more than men. We own the Internet, and we should be building
the companies of tomorrow. And I think when companies
have diverse teams, and they have incredible women
that are part of their engineering teams, they build awesome things,
and we see it every day. CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.
You're doing incredibly important work. This whole community is cheering you on.
More power to you. Thank you. RS: Thank you. (Applause)

in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference
between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying
to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher
tells me the same story. During the first week,
when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over
and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write." The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better,
she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes
just staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student
wrote code and then deleted it. She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing
the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust. It turns out that our girls
are really good at coding, but it's not enough
just to teach them to code. My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours
with computer science students. When the guys are struggling
with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with my code." The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with me." We have to begin to undo
the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it
with building a sisterhood that lets girls know
that they are not alone. Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me, "I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network
cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. Take, for instance,
two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love
for her new country by building an app
to help Americans get to the polls. Or a 16-year-old girl
who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer
is benign or malignant in the off chance
that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just
three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been
socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying,
who have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams. And those dreams have never been
more important for our country. For the American economy,
for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind
half our population. We have to socialize our girls
to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them
to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. We have to teach them
to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential
to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them
that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you
to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece,
your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach
girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement
of young women who are brave and who will build
a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have.
You have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls
are involved now in your program? Reshma Saujani: Yeah.
So in 2012, we taught 20 girls. This year we'll teach 40,000
in all 50 states. (Applause) And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated
7,500 women in computer science. Like, the problem is so bad that we can make
that type of change quickly. CA: And you're working with some
of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming
graduates from your program? RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. And if you're not signed up,
I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code
classroom in their office. CA: And you have some stories
back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams,
good things happen. RS: Great things happen. I mean, I think that it's crazy to me
to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all
consumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate
of 600 percent more than men. We own the Internet, and we should be building
the companies of tomorrow. And I think when companies
have diverse teams, and they have incredible women
that are part of their engineering teams, they build awesome things,
and we see it every day. CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.
You're doing incredibly important work. This whole community is cheering you on.
More power to you. Thank you. RS: Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress. For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however,
told a very different story. My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win. But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart
in a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement
from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal
snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest
races in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy
an Indian girl was running. But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers
that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating. Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk
about the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story
of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time
in my entire life that I had done something
that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect. And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate
towards careers and professions that they know
they're going to be great in, that they know they're
going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught
to avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars
and then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise
or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated
to take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously
unless you've had two failed start-ups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave. Some people worry
about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society,
we're just losing out because we're not raising
our girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why
women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look. In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders
handled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls
were quick to give up. The higher the IQ,
the more likely they were to give up. Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material
to be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely
to redouble their efforts. What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys
in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys
and girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found
that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent
of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent
of the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked
as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized
to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. (Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take
less risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs
that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy
is being left behind on all the innovation and problems
women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. (Applause) So in 2012, I started a company
to teach girls to code, and what I found
is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process
of trial and error, of trying to get the right command
in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference
between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying
to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher

to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all
consumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate
of 600 percent more than men. We own the Internet, and we should be building

**Transcript**:
So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress. For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however,
told a very different story. My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win. But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart
in a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement
from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal
snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest
races in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy
an Indian girl was running. But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers
that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating. Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk
about the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story
of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time
in my entire life that I had done something
that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect. And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate
towards careers and professions that they know
they're going to be great in, that they know they're
going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught
to avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars
and then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise
or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated
to take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously
unless you've had two failed start-ups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave. Some people worry
about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society,
we're just losing out because we're not raising
our girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why
women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look. In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders
handled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls
were quick to give up. The higher the IQ,
the more likely they were to give up. Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material
to be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely
to redouble their efforts. What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys
in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys
and girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found
that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent
of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent
of the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked
as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized
to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. (Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take
less risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs
that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy
is being left behind on all the innovation and problems
women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. (Applause) So in 2012, I started a company
to teach girls to code, and what I found
is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process
of trial and error, of trying to get the right command
in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference
between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying
to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher
tells me the same story. During the first week,
when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over
and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write." The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better,
she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes
just staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student
wrote code and then deleted it. She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing
the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust. It turns out that our girls
are really good at coding, but it's not enough
just to teach them to code. My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours
with computer science students. When the guys are struggling
with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with my code." The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something
wrong with me." We have to begin to undo
the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it
with building a sisterhood that lets girls know
that they are not alone. Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me, "I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network
cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. Take, for instance,
two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love
for her new country by building an app
to help Americans get to the polls. Or a 16-year-old girl
who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer
is benign or malignant in the off chance
that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just
three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been
socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying,
who have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams. And those dreams have never been
more important for our country. For the American economy,
for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind
half our population. We have to socialize our girls
to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them
to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. We have to teach them
to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential
to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them
that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you
to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece,
your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach
girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement
of young women who are brave and who will build
a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have.
You have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls
are involved now in your program? Reshma Saujani: Yeah.
So in 2012, we taught 20 girls. This year we'll teach 40,000
in all 50 states. (Applause) And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated
7,500 women in computer science. Like, the problem is so bad that we can make
that type of change quickly. CA: And you're working with some
of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming
graduates from your program? RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. And if you're not signed up,
I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code
classroom in their office. CA: And you have some stories
back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams,
good things happen. RS: Great things happen. I mean, I think that it's crazy to me
to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all
consumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate
of 600 percent more than men. We own the Internet, and we should be building

**Transcript**:
At roughly 4pm on July 20, 1969, mankind was just minutes away 
from landing on the surface of the moon. But before the astronauts 
began their final descent, an emergency alarm lit up. Something was overloading 
the computer, and threatened to abort the landing. Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton 
held her breath. She'd led the team developing 
the pioneering in-flight software, so she knew this mission 
had no room for error. But the nature 
of this last-second emergency would soon prove her software 
was working exactly as planned. Born 33 years earlier in Paoli, Indiana, 
Hamilton had always been inquisitive. In college, she studied mathematics
and philosophy, before taking a research position at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pay for grad school. Here, she encountered her first computer
while developing software to support research 
into the new field of chaos theory. Next at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Hamilton developed software 
for America’s first air defense system to search for enemy aircraft. But when she heard 
that renowned engineer Charles Draper was looking for help 
sending mankind to the moon, she immediately joined his team. NASA looked to Draper and his group 
of over 400 engineers to invent the first compact 
digital flight computer, the Apollo Guidance Computer. Using input from astronauts, this device would be responsible 
for guiding, navigating and controlling the spacecraft. At a time when unreliable computers 
filled entire rooms, the AGC needed to operate 
without any errors, and fit in one cubic foot of space. Draper divided the lab into two teams, one for designing hardware 
and one for developing software. Hamilton led the team that built 
the on-board flight software for both the Command and Lunar Modules. This work, for which she coined the term
“software engineering," was incredibly high stakes. Human lives were on the line, 
so every program had to be perfect. Margaret’s software needed to quickly
detect unexpected errors and recover from them in real time. But this kind of adaptable program 
was difficult to build, since early software could only process 
jobs in a predetermined order. To solve this problem, Margaret designed her program 
to be “asynchronous,” meaning the software's more important
jobs would interrupt less important ones. Her team assigned every task 
a unique priority to ensure that each job 
occurred in the correct order and at the right time—
regardless of any surprises. After this breakthrough, Margaret realized her software 
could help the astronauts work in an asynchronous environment as well. She designed Priority Displays that would interrupt 
astronaut’s regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies. The astronaut could then communicate
with Mission Control to determine the best path forward. This marked the first time flight software
communicated directly— and asynchronously— 
with a pilot. It was these fail safes that triggered 
the alarms just before the lunar landing. Buzz Aldrin quickly realized his mistake— he’d inadvertently flipped 
the rendezvous radar switch. This radar would be essential 
on their journey home, but here it was using up 
vital computational resources. Fortunately, the Apollo Guidance Computer
was well equipped to manage this. During the overload, 
the software restart programs allowed only the highest priority jobs 
to be processed— including the programs 
necessary for landing. The Priority Displays 
gave the astronauts a choice— to land or not to land. With minutes to spare, 
Mission Control gave the order. The Apollo 11 landing was about 
the astronauts, Mission Control, software and hardware all working together
as an integrated system of systems. Hamilton’s contributions were essential
to the work of engineers and scientists inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s 
goal to reach the Moon. And her life-saving work 
went far beyond Apollo 11— no bugs were ever found in the in-flight
software for any crewed Apollo missions. After her work on Apollo, Hamilton founded a company that uses 
its unique universal systems language to create breakthroughs 
for systems and software. In 2003, NASA honored her achievements 
with the largest financial award they’d ever given to an individual. And 47 years after her software
first guided astronauts to the moon, Hamilton was awarded 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom for changing the way we think 
about technology.

**Transcript**:
At roughly 4pm on July 20, 1969, mankind was just minutes away 
from landing on the surface of the moon. But before the astronauts 
began their final descent, an emergency alarm lit up. Something was overloading 
the computer, and threatened to abort the landing. Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton 
held her breath. She'd led the team developing 
the pioneering in-flight software, so she knew this mission 
had no room for error. But the nature 
of this last-second emergency would soon prove her software 
was working exactly as planned. Born 33 years earlier in Paoli, Indiana, 
Hamilton had always been inquisitive. In college, she studied mathematics
and philosophy, before taking a research position at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pay for grad school. Here, she encountered her first computer
while developing software to support research 
into the new field of chaos theory. Next at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Hamilton developed software 
for America’s first air defense system to search for enemy aircraft. But when she heard 
that renowned engineer Charles Draper was looking for help 
sending mankind to the moon, she immediately joined his team. NASA looked to Draper and his group 
of over 400 engineers to invent the first compact 
digital flight computer, the Apollo Guidance Computer. Using input from astronauts, this device would be responsible 
for guiding, navigating and controlling the spacecraft. At a time when unreliable computers 
filled entire rooms, the AGC needed to operate 
without any errors, and fit in one cubic foot of space. Draper divided the lab into two teams, one for designing hardware 
and one for developing software. Hamilton led the team that built 
the on-board flight software for both the Command and Lunar Modules. This work, for which she coined the term
“software engineering," was incredibly high stakes. Human lives were on the line, 
so every program had to be perfect. Margaret’s software needed to quickly
detect unexpected errors and recover from them in real time. But this kind of adaptable program 
was difficult to build, since early software could only process 
jobs in a predetermined order. To solve this problem, Margaret designed her program 
to be “asynchronous,” meaning the software's more important
jobs would interrupt less important ones. Her team assigned every task 
a unique priority to ensure that each job 
occurred in the correct order and at the right time—
regardless of any surprises. After this breakthrough, Margaret realized her software 
could help the astronauts work in an asynchronous environment as well. She designed Priority Displays that would interrupt 
astronaut’s regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies. The astronaut could then communicate
with Mission Control to determine the best path forward. This marked the first time flight software
communicated directly— and asynchronously— 
with a pilot. It was these fail safes that triggered 
the alarms just before the lunar landing. Buzz Aldrin quickly realized his mistake— he’d inadvertently flipped 
the rendezvous radar switch. This radar would be essential 
on their journey home, but here it was using up 
vital computational resources. Fortunately, the Apollo Guidance Computer
was well equipped to manage this. During the overload, 
the software restart programs allowed only the highest priority jobs 
to be processed— including the programs 
necessary for landing. The Priority Displays 
gave the astronauts a choice— to land or not to land. With minutes to spare, 
Mission Control gave the order. The Apollo 11 landing was about 
the astronauts, Mission Control, software and hardware all working together
as an integrated system of systems. Hamilton’s contributions were essential
to the work of engineers and scientists inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s 
goal to reach the Moon. And her life-saving work 
went far beyond Apollo 11— no bugs were ever found in the in-flight

with the largest financial award they’d ever given to an individual. And 47 years after her software

the Presidential Medal of Freedom for changing the way we think 
about technology.

**Transcript**:
A woman in rags emerged from the swamp
flanked by seven giant scorpions. Carrying a baby, she headed 
for the nearest village to beg for food. She approached a magnificent mansion, but the mistress of the house 
took one look at her grimy clothes and unusual companions 
and slammed the door in her face. So she continued down the road 
until she came to a cottage. The woman there took pity on the stranger
and offered her what she could: a simple meal and a bed of straw. Her guest was no ordinary beggar. She was Isis, 
the most powerful goddess in Egypt. Isis was in hiding from her brother Set, who murdered her husband and wanted 
to murder her infant son, Horus. Set was also a powerful god, 
and he was looking for them. So to keep her cover, 
Isis had to be very discreet— she couldn’t risk using her powers. But she was not without aid. Serket, goddess of venomous creatures, had sent seven of her fiercest servants 
to guard Isis and her son. As Isis and Horus settled 
into their humble accommodation, the scorpions fumed at how the wealthy
woman had offended their divine mistress. They all combined their venom 
and gave it to one of the seven, Tefen. In the dead of night, 
Tefen crept over to the mansion. As he crawled under the door, he saw the owner’s young son 
sleeping peacefully and gave him a mighty sting. Isis and her hostess were soon awakened
by loud wailing. As they peered out of the doorway 
of the cottage, they saw a mother running 
through the street, weeping as she cradled her son. When Isis recognized the woman 
who had turned her away, she understood what her 
scorpions had done. Isis took the boy in her arms 
and began to recite a powerful spell: "O poison of Tefen, come out of him 
and fall upon the ground! Poison of Befen, advance not, 
penetrate no farther, come out of him, and fall upon the ground! For I am Isis, the great Enchantress, 
the Speaker of spells. Fall down, O poison of Mestet! 
Hasten not, poison of Mestetef! Rise not, poison of Petet and Thetet! 
Approach not, poison of Matet!" With each name she invoked, 
that scorpion’s poison was neutralized. The child stirred, 
and his mother wept with gratitude and lamented her earlier callousness, offering all her wealth 
to Isis in repentance. The woman who had taken Isis in 
watched in awe— she had had no idea who she’d brought
under her roof. And from that day on, the people learned to make a poultice 
to treat scorpion bites, speaking magical incantations 
just as the goddess had.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2013, a team of researchers 
held a math test. The exam was administered 
to over 1,100 American adults, and designed, in part, to test 
their ability to evaluate sets of data. Hidden among these math problems 
were two almost identical questions. Both problems 
used the same difficult data set, and each had one objectively 
correct answer. The first asked about the correlation 
between rashes and a new skin cream. The second asked about the correlation 
between crime rates and gun control legislation. Participants with strong math skills were much more likely 
to get the first question correct. But despite being 
mathematically identical, the results for the second question 
looked totally different. Here, math skills 
weren’t the best predictor of which participants answered correctly. Instead, another variable the researchers 
had been tracking came into play: political identity. Participants whose political beliefs aligned with a correct interpretation 
of the data were far more likely 
to answer the problem right. Even the study’s top mathematicians were 45% more likely 
to get the second question wrong when the correct answer 
challenged their political beliefs. What is it about politics that inspires 
this kind of illogical error? Can someone’s political identity 
actually affect their ability to process information? The answer lies in a cognitive phenomenon that has become increasingly visible 
in public life: partisanship. While it’s often invoked 
in the context of politics, partisanship is more broadly defined 
as a strong preference or bias towards any particular group or idea. Our political, ethnic, religious, 
and national identities are all different forms of partisanship. Of course, identifying with social groups is an essential and healthy part 
of human life. Our sense of self is defined not only by 
who we are as individuals, but also by the groups we belong to. As a result, we’re strongly motivated 
to defend our group identities, protecting both our sense of self 
and our social communities. But this becomes a problem 
when the group’s beliefs are at odds with reality. Imagine watching your favorite sports team
commit a serious foul. You know that’s against the rules, but your fellow fans 
think it’s totally acceptable. The tension between 
these two incompatible thoughts is called cognitive dissonance, and most people are driven to resolve 
this uncomfortable state of limbo. You might start to blame the referee, 
complain that the other team started it, or even convince yourself 
there was no foul in the first place. In a case like this, people are often more motivated 
to maintain a positive relationship with their group 
than perceive the world accurately. This behavior 
is especially dangerous in politics. On an individual scale, allegiance to a party allows people 
to create a political identity and support policies they agree with. But partisan-based cognitive dissonance 
can lead people to reject evidence that’s inconsistent with the party line 
or discredits party leaders. And when entire groups of people revise 
the facts in service of partisan beliefs, it can lead to policies 
that aren’t grounded in truth or reason. This problem isn’t new— political identities 
have been around for centuries. But studies show 
that partisan polarization has increased dramatically 
in the last few decades. One theory explaining this increase is the trend towards clustering 
geographically in like-minded communities. Another is the growing tendency 
to rely on partisan news or social media bubbles. These often act like echo chambers, delivering news and ideas 
from people with similar views. Fortunately, cognitive scientists 
have uncovered some strategies for resisting this distortion filter. One is to remember that you’re probably 
more biased than you think. So when you encounter new information, make a deliberate effort 
to push through your initial intuition and evaluate it analytically. In your own groups, try to make 
fact-checking and questioning assumptions a valued part of the culture. Warning people that they might have been 
presented with misinformation can also help. And when you’re trying 
to persuade someone else, affirming their values 
and framing the issue in their language can help make people more receptive. We still have a long way to go before 
solving the problem of partisanship. But hopefully, these tools 
can help keep us better informed, and capable of making evidence-based 
decisions about our shared reality.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 18, Ground Truth Question 5, Matched Generated Question 5
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2013, a team of researchers 
held a math test. The exam was administered 
to over 1,100 American adults, and designed, in part, to test 
their ability to evaluate sets of data. Hidden among these math problems 
were two almost identical questions. Both problems 
used the same difficult data set, and each had one objectively 
correct answer. The first asked about the correlation 
between rashes and a new skin cream. The second asked about the correlation 
between crime rates and gun control legislation. Participants with strong math skills were much more likely 
to get the first question correct. But despite being 
mathematically identical, the results for the second question 
looked totally different. Here, math skills 
weren’t the best predictor of which participants answered correctly. Instead, another variable the researchers 
had been tracking came into play: political identity. Participants whose political beliefs aligned with a correct interpretation 
of the data were far more likely 
to answer the problem right. Even the study’s top mathematicians were 45% more likely 
to get the second question wrong when the correct answer 
challenged their political beliefs. What is it about politics that inspires 
this kind of illogical error? Can someone’s political identity 
actually affect their ability to process information? The answer lies in a cognitive phenomenon that has become increasingly visible 
in public life: partisanship. While it’s often invoked 
in the context of politics, partisanship is more broadly defined 
as a strong preference or bias towards any particular group or idea. Our political, ethnic, religious, 
and national identities are all different forms of partisanship. Of course, identifying with social groups is an essential and healthy part 
of human life. Our sense of self is defined not only by 
who we are as individuals, but also by the groups we belong to. As a result, we’re strongly motivated 
to defend our group identities, protecting both our sense of self 
and our social communities. But this becomes a problem 
when the group’s beliefs are at odds with reality. Imagine watching your favorite sports team
commit a serious foul. You know that’s against the rules, but your fellow fans 
think it’s totally acceptable. The tension between 
these two incompatible thoughts is called cognitive dissonance, and most people are driven to resolve 
this uncomfortable state of limbo. You might start to blame the referee, 
complain that the other team started it, or even convince yourself 
there was no foul in the first place. In a case like this, people are often more motivated 
to maintain a positive relationship with their group 
than perceive the world accurately. This behavior 
is especially dangerous in politics. On an individual scale, allegiance to a party allows people 
to create a political identity and support policies they agree with. But partisan-based cognitive dissonance 
can lead people to reject evidence that’s inconsistent with the party line 
or discredits party leaders. And when entire groups of people revise 
the facts in service of partisan beliefs, it can lead to policies 
that aren’t grounded in truth or reason. This problem isn’t new— political identities 
have been around for centuries. But studies show 
that partisan polarization has increased dramatically 
in the last few decades. One theory explaining this increase is the trend towards clustering 
geographically in like-minded communities. Another is the growing tendency 
to rely on partisan news or social media bubbles. These often act like echo chambers, delivering news and ideas 
from people with similar views. Fortunately, cognitive scientists 
have uncovered some strategies for resisting this distortion filter. One is to remember that you’re probably 
more biased than you think. So when you encounter new information, make a deliberate effort 
to push through your initial intuition and evaluate it analytically. In your own groups, try to make 
fact-checking and questioning assumptions a valued part of the culture. Warning people that they might have been 
presented with misinformation can also help. And when you’re trying 
to persuade someone else, affirming their values 
and framing the issue in their language can help make people more receptive. We still have a long way to go before 
solving the problem of partisanship. But hopefully, these tools 
can help keep us better informed, and capable of making evidence-based 
decisions about our shared reality.

**Transcript**:
Centuries ago, the Inca developed 
ingenuous suits of armor that could flex 
with the blows of sharp spears and maces, protecting warriors 
from even the fiercest physical attacks. These hardy structures 
were made not from iron or steel, but rather something unexpectedly soft: 
cotton. These thickly woven, 
layered quilts of cotton could distribute the energy from a blow 
across a large surface area, shielding warriors 
without restricting their mobility. These seemingly contradictory features— strength and flexibility, 
softness and durability— have their roots in the intricate biology 
of the nearly invisible cotton fiber. These fibers begin life 
deep within a cotton flower, on the surface of a seed. As many as 16,000 fibers 
will festoon a single seed, bulging from the seed’s surface 
like miniature water balloons. Each cotton fiber, 
no matter how large it grows, is made of just one cell. That cell has multiple layers 
of cell wall. After a few days, 
the sides of the first layer, called the primary cell wall, stiffen, pushing cell growth 
in one direction and causing the fiber to elongate. The fiber elongates 
quickly for about 16 days. Then it begins the next stage: 
strengthening the cell wall. It does this by making more 
of the carbohydrate cellulose. Cellulose will make up 
34% of the cell wall at this stage and swiftly increases. This new growth 
also reinforces the cell wall by going against the grain 
of the existing wall. The strengthened wall is more rigid, 
restricting further growth. That means if the fiber 
remodels its walls too early, it will be short, and ultimately make rough, weak fabrics. But if cell wall strengthening 
begins too late, the wall won’t be sturdy enough— producing fibers that are too weak 
to hold fabrics together well. In ideal growing conditions— with the right temperature, water, 
fertilizer, pest control, and light— a cotton fiber can grow 
up to 3.6 centimeters long with only a 25 micrometer width. Long, fine fibers 
can wrap around one another better than shorter, 
less fine fibers, which means those long, fine fibers 
make stronger threads that hang together better as fabric. Cotton with these qualities 
has diverse uses— from soft textiles 
to the U.S. dollar bill, which is 75% cotton. The next crucial stage 
of the cotton fiber’s growth begins as it thickens 
its secondary cell wall by depositing large quantities 
of cellulose into the secondary layer. Cellulose goes on to make up 
over 90% of the fiber’s weight. The more cellulose that gets deposited, the denser that secondary layer becomes— and this determines 
the strength of the final fiber. This stage is essential 
for developing long-lasting material for the likes of, say, a t-shirt. The garment’s capacity 
to withstand years of washing and wear is largely determined by the density 
of that secondary cell wall. On the other hand, its softness is strongly influenced 
by the length of the fiber, established with the remodeling 
of the primary wall layer. Finally, after about 50 days, 
the fiber is fully grown. The living matter 
within the cell dies off, leaving behind only the cellulose. The dried cotton seed pod, or boll, 
that surrounds the fibers cracks open, unveiling a burst of several thousand 
fiber cells in a fluffy mass. The thread-like fibers we see— 
thinner than a human hair— are the remains of those dense, 
dried out walls of cellulose. Tens of thousands of these fibers 
spun into yarn will go on to make everything from fabric,
to coffee filters, diapers, and fishing nets. And with the help of modern science, cotton might soon be softer, stronger, 
and more resilient than ever as researchers investigate 
how to optimize its growth based on nutrients, weather conditions, 
and genetics.

remodels its walls too early, it will be short, and ultimately make rough, weak fabrics. But if cell wall strengthening 
begins too late, the wall won’t be sturdy enough— producing fibers that are too weak 
to hold fabrics together well. In ideal growing conditions— with the right temperature, water, 
fertilizer, pest control, and light— a cotton fiber can grow 
up to 3.6 centimeters long with only a 25 micrometer width. Long, fine fibers 
can wrap around one another better than shorter, 
less fine fibers, which means those long, fine fibers 
make stronger threads that hang together better as fabric. Cotton with these qualities 
has diverse uses— from soft textiles 
to the U.S. dollar bill, which is 75% cotton. The next crucial stage 
of the cotton fiber’s growth begins as it thickens 
its secondary cell wall by depositing large quantities 
of cellulose into the secondary layer. Cellulose goes on to make up 
over 90% of the fiber’s weight. The more cellulose that gets deposited, the denser that secondary layer becomes— and this determines 
the strength of the final fiber. This stage is essential 
for developing long-lasting material for the likes of, say, a t-shirt. The garment’s capacity 
to withstand years of washing and wear is largely determined by the density 
of that secondary cell wall. On the other hand, its softness is strongly influenced 
by the length of the fiber, established with the remodeling 
of the primary wall layer. Finally, after about 50 days, 
the fiber is fully grown. The living matter 
within the cell dies off, leaving behind only the cellulose. The dried cotton seed pod, or boll, 
that surrounds the fibers cracks open, unveiling a burst of several thousand 
fiber cells in a fluffy mass. The thread-like fibers we see— 
thinner than a human hair— are the remains of those dense, 
dried out walls of cellulose. Tens of thousands of these fibers 
spun into yarn will go on to make everything from fabric,
to coffee filters, diapers, and fishing nets. And with the help of modern science, cotton might soon be softer, stronger, 
and more resilient than ever as researchers investigate 
how to optimize its growth based on nutrients, weather conditions, 
and genetics.

**Transcript**:
Centuries ago, the Inca developed 
ingenuous suits of armor that could flex 
with the blows of sharp spears and maces, protecting warriors 
from even the fiercest physical attacks. These hardy structures 
were made not from iron or steel, but rather something unexpectedly soft: 
cotton. These thickly woven, 
layered quilts of cotton could distribute the energy from a blow 
across a large surface area, shielding warriors 
without restricting their mobility. These seemingly contradictory features— strength and flexibility, 
softness and durability— have their roots in the intricate biology 
of the nearly invisible cotton fiber. These fibers begin life 
deep within a cotton flower, on the surface of a seed. As many as 16,000 fibers 
will festoon a single seed, bulging from the seed’s surface 
like miniature water balloons. Each cotton fiber, 
no matter how large it grows, is made of just one cell. That cell has multiple layers 
of cell wall. After a few days, 
the sides of the first layer, called the primary cell wall, stiffen, pushing cell growth 
in one direction and causing the fiber to elongate. The fiber elongates 
quickly for about 16 days. Then it begins the next stage: 
strengthening the cell wall. It does this by making more 
of the carbohydrate cellulose. Cellulose will make up 
34% of the cell wall at this stage and swiftly increases. This new growth 
also reinforces the cell wall by going against the grain 
of the existing wall. The strengthened wall is more rigid, 
restricting further growth. That means if the fiber 
remodels its walls too early, it will be short, and ultimately make rough, weak fabrics. But if cell wall strengthening 
begins too late, the wall won’t be sturdy enough— producing fibers that are too weak 
to hold fabrics together well. In ideal growing conditions— with the right temperature, water, 
fertilizer, pest control, and light— a cotton fiber can grow 
up to 3.6 centimeters long with only a 25 micrometer width. Long, fine fibers 
can wrap around one another better than shorter, 
less fine fibers, which means those long, fine fibers

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Joseph Geni
Reviewer: Morton Bast When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job
in management consulting for a job that was even more
demanding: teaching. I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher,
I made quizzes and tests. I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back,
I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ
was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers
did not have stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids
weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking. The kinds of things you need
to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals,
the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced
that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion
that what we need in education is a much better understanding
of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective. In education, the one thing
we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing
well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn
quickly and easily? So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school
to become a psychologist. I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super
challenging settings, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why? My research team and I went
to West Point Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training
and which would drop out. We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children
would advance farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers
working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still
going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year, and of those, who will be
the most effective at improving learning
outcomes for their students? We partnered with private
companies, asking, which of these salespeople
is going to keep their jobs? And who's going to earn the most money? In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged
as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit. Grit is passion and perseverance
for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future,
day in, day out, not just for the week,
not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard
to make that future a reality. Grit is living life
like it's a marathon, not a sprint. A few years ago, I started studying grit
in the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more
likely to graduate, even when I matched them
on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt
when they were at school. So it's not just at West Point
or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school, especially for kids
at risk for dropping out. To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows,
about building it. Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I build grit in kids? What do I do to teach kids
a solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated
for the long run?" The honest answer is, I don't know. (Laughter) What I do know is that talent
doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through
on their commitments. In fact, in our data,
grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related
to measures of talent. So far, the best idea I've heard
about building grit in kids is something called "growth mindset." This is an idea developed
at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability
to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read
and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows
in response to challenge, they're much more likely
to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure
is a permanent condition. So growth mindset
is a great idea for building grit. But we need more. And that's where I'm going
to end my remarks, because that's where we are. That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas,
our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them. We need to measure
whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing
to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. Thank you. (Applause)
