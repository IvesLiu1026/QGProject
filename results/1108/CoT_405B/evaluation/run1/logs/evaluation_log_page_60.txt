**Transcript**:
Have you ever seen a big, red "No Running" sign at a public pool? For the most part, the pace on the deck reflects this statement. But while the sign accurately describes the patrons' movements, isn't it true that people are walking because the sign tells them no running? So, is this sign portraying the pool's environment, or is it doing something else, something more powerful? The difference between a statement that describes and one that commands is an idea developed by British linguist J. L. Austin. He defines this distinction as two separate parts of speech: constatives and performatives. Constatives are sentences that describe something as true or false, and performatives are sentences that denote an action. In other words, a constative is, and a performative does. To help us distinguish these two parts of speech, let's start by examining constatives around the park outside the pool. The first sign we encounter says, "The park closes at 6 p.m." After checking with a friendly park official that the park does, indeed, close at 6, we can confirm that this statement is a true constative. Nearby, there's a man on a bench with a newspaper, and the headline reads, "Heatwave!" However, the sky is cloudy and it feels quite chilly. Today's headline is a false constative as it has proven to be incorrect. Before the rain starts to fall, let's throw away our can of soda at the blue trash bin that says, "Recycle." It's a performative. Performatives are sentences that are meant to inspire actions. Rather than conveying a message, it acts upon the world, it does something. In this case, the performative of "Recycle" is requesting people to put their trash into the proper receptacle. Words not only bring about actions, sometimes words themselves are actions. This is what is known as speech acts. These actions include, but are not limited to, ordering, promising, apologizing, warning, sentencing, christening, and even marrying. Take a look at the wedding near the gazebo. The couple says the words, "I do." The speech act here are the words, "I do." These words cause them to marry one another. "I do" has acted upon them and profoundly changed their world. However, performatives depend on context and reception. These are known as felicity conditions. Imagine if the mayor showed up to the wedding and said, "By the power vested in me as mayor of the city, I name this gazebo 'The Mayor's Pizza Palace.'" His words would be a speech act by which he named the gazebo. And because he's the mayor, the gazebo would be known by its new name. But if someone who isn't the mayor, just a normal passerby, decides to name the gazebo after her favorite cat, the chances are the name would not change. Felicity conditions are the rules under which the performative can be enacted. These are fairly logical. The performative should have proper authority, it should be understood, it should be clear, and it should be able to be executed. If the performative doesn't meet these conditions, then it doesn't have the power to denote action. But just because a performative meets its conditions and is clearly stated, doesn't mean that it's implicitly followed. Back at the pool, a rowdy group of teenagers races to the high dive. "No running" does not seem to have power over them, and they'll have to face the consequences of breaking this performative. They may even have to force out some performatives of their own, such as apologizing to the life guard and promising to never run again. Maybe the life guard will respond with another performative, sentencing them to be banished from the pool for the rest of the day. After all, these teenagers must learn to respect the power of words.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: What are sentences that describe something as true or false called? Options: A. Performatives, B. Constatives, C. Speech acts, D. Declaratives Correct Option: B**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that asks about a specific scenario where a statement is false, similar to the ground truth MCQ.

A better match is not available among the provided generated MCQs. Nevertheless, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the closest in terms of content and intent, as it deals with the concept of constatives, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**Question: A newspaper headline reads, "Sunny Skies Ahead!" but it is actually raining outside. What type of sentence is this headline? Options: A. Performative, B. True Constative, C. False Constative, D. Speech Act Correct Option: C**

This new question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

However, since I need to provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ from the existing options, I would say:

**Index: 2**

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Here's why:

- Question intent: Both the ground truth MCQ and Question 7 aim to understand the concept of speech acts/performatives and their relationship with other types of sentences.
- Options: Although the options are not identical, both questions have options that distinguish between describing and performing an action, which is the core idea of speech acts/performatives.
- Content: Question 7 specifically highlights the difference between constatives (describing) and performatives (commanding or performing an action), which is closely related to the concept of speech acts.

However, it's worth noting that there isn't a generated MCQ that perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose one, I would say Question 7 is the closest match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 11. 

Although the wording is not identical, the intent and content of Question 11 align with the ground truth MCQ. Both questions address the idea that a performative (in this case, a "No Running" sign) meeting its felicity conditions and being clearly stated does not guarantee its effectiveness in achieving its intended goal. The correct option for Question 11 (D) also aligns with the correct option for the ground truth MCQ (A), as both acknowledge that the effectiveness of a performative depends on context and reception.

However, another generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. This question directly addresses what happens when a performative meets its felicity conditions, and option D states that the effectiveness of the performative depends on the context and reception.

Between Questions 8 and 11, Question 8 is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content. However, Question 8's correct option (C) does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ's correct option (A). Considering both aspects, I would still argue that Question 11 is the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Nicolas Steno is rarely heard of outside Intro to Geology, but anyone hoping to understand life on Earth should see how Steno expanded and connected those very concepts: Earth, life, and understanding. Born Niels Stensen in 1638 Denmark, son of a goldsmith, he was a sickly kid whose school chums died of plague. He survived to cut up corpses as an anatomist, studying organs shared across species. He found a duct in animal skulls that sends saliva to the mouth. He refuted Descartes' idea that only humans had a pineal gland, proving it wasn't the seat of the soul, arguably, the debut of neuroscience. Most remarkable for the time was his method. Steno never let ancient texts, Aristotelian metaphysics, or Cartesian deductions overrule empirical, experimental evidence. His vision, uncluttered by speculation or rationalization, went deep. Steno had seen how gallstones form in wet organs by accretion. They obeyed molding principles he knew from the goldsmith trade, rules useful across disciplines for understanding solids by their structural relationships. Later, the Grand Duke of Tuscany had him dissect a shark. Its teeth resembled tongue stones, odd rocks seen inside other rocks in Malta and the mountains near Florence. Pliny the Elder, old Roman naturalist, said these fell from the sky. In the Dark Ages, folks said they were snake tongues, petrified by Saint Paul. Steno saw that tongue stones were shark teeth and vice versa, with the same signs of structural growth. Figuring similar things are made in similar ways, he argued the ancient teeth came from ancient sharks in waters that formed rock around the teeth and became mountains. Rock layers were once layers of watery sediment, which would lay out horizontally, one atop another, oldest up to newest. If layers were deformed, tilted, cut by a fault or a canyon, that change came after the layer formed. Sounds simple today; back then, revolutionary. He'd invented stratigraphy and laid geology's ground work. By finding one origin for shark teeth from two eras by stating natural laws ruling the present also ruled the past, Steno planted seeds for uniformitarianism, the idea that the past was shaped by processes observable today. In the 18th and 19th centuries, English uniformitarian geologists, James Hutton and Charles Lyell, studied current, very slow rates of erosion and sedimentation and realized the Earth had to be way older than the biblical guestimate, 6000 years. Out of their work came the rock cycle, which combined with plate tectonics in the mid-twentieth century to give us the great molten-crusting, quaking, all-encircling theory of the Earth, from a gallstone to a 4.5 billion-year-old planet. Now think bigger, take it to biology. Say you see shark teeth in one layer and a fossil of an organism you've never seen under that. The deeper fossil's older, yes? You now have evidence of the origin and extinction of species over time. Get uniformitarian. Maybe a process still active today caused changes not just in rocks but in life. It might also explain similarities and differences between species found by anatomists like Steno. It's a lot to ponder, but Charles Darwin had the time on a long trip to the Galapagos, reading a copy of his friend Charles Lyell's "Principles of Geology," which Steno sort of founded. Sometimes giants stand on the shoulders of curious little people. Nicolas Steno helped evolve evolution, broke ground for geology, and showed how unbiased, empirical observation can cut across intellectual borders to deepen our perspective. His finest accomplishment, though, may be his maxim, casting the search for truth beyond our senses and our current understanding as the pursuit of the beauty of the as yet unknown. Beautiful is what we see, more beautiful is what we know, most beautiful, by far, is what we don't.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What might a uniformitarianist meteorologist say about the prospect of a super-blizzard covering the northern hemisphere of the earth over the course of a day?
Options: A. We have no evidence of it ever happening before, so it probably won’t happen, but if it happens, maybe it also happened in the past, at the same very, very low rate of occurrence, B. It’s not in the Bible, so if it happens, the Bible is wrong about everything, C. It’s not in the Bible, so if it happens, God made super-blizzards to test our faith, D. It’s very unlikely, but if it does happen it will happen every day after that, too, as a uniform daily occurrence

Using a computer model to simulate the feature's formation, C. Conducting experiments to recreate the feature, D. Consulting ancient texts and philosophical deductions Correct Option: A**

However, this question doesn't perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that directly addresses the concept of uniformitarianism in the context of a specific event or phenomenon.

A closer match is **Question 3: What is the core principle of uniformitarianism in geology? Options: A. The Earth's features are the result of catastrophic events, B. The Earth's processes have changed over time, C. The past was shaped by processes observable today, D. The Earth is only 6,000 years old Correct Option: C**

But this question is more focused on defining uniformitarianism rather than applying it to a specific scenario.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it is **Question 7**. However, I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that **Question 8** and **Question 3** could be considered similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, but they don't match the question intent and options.

**Transcript**:
Nicolas Steno is rarely heard of outside Intro to Geology, but anyone hoping to understand life on Earth should see how Steno expanded and connected those very concepts: Earth, life, and understanding. Born Niels Stensen in 1638 Denmark, son of a goldsmith, he was a sickly kid whose school chums died of plague. He survived to cut up corpses as an anatomist, studying organs shared across species. He found a duct in animal skulls that sends saliva to the mouth. He refuted Descartes' idea that only humans had a pineal gland, proving it wasn't the seat of the soul, arguably, the debut of neuroscience. Most remarkable for the time was his method. Steno never let ancient texts, Aristotelian metaphysics, or Cartesian deductions overrule empirical, experimental evidence. His vision, uncluttered by speculation or rationalization, went deep. Steno had seen how gallstones form in wet organs by accretion. They obeyed molding principles he knew from the goldsmith trade, rules useful across disciplines for understanding solids by their structural relationships. Later, the Grand Duke of Tuscany had him dissect a shark. Its teeth resembled tongue stones, odd rocks seen inside other rocks in Malta and the mountains near Florence. Pliny the Elder, old Roman naturalist, said these fell from the sky. In the Dark Ages, folks said they were snake tongues, petrified by Saint Paul. Steno saw that tongue stones were shark teeth and vice versa, with the same signs of structural growth. Figuring similar things are made in similar ways, he argued the ancient teeth came from ancient sharks in waters that formed rock around the teeth and became mountains. Rock layers were once layers of watery sediment, which would lay out horizontally, one atop another, oldest up to newest. If layers were deformed, tilted, cut by a fault or a canyon, that change came after the layer formed. Sounds simple today; back then, revolutionary. He'd invented stratigraphy and laid geology's ground work. By finding one origin for shark teeth from two eras by stating natural laws ruling the present also ruled the past, Steno planted seeds for uniformitarianism, the idea that the past was shaped by processes observable today. In the 18th and 19th centuries, English uniformitarian geologists, James Hutton and Charles Lyell, studied current, very slow rates of erosion and sedimentation and realized the Earth had to be way older than the biblical guestimate, 6000 years. Out of their work came the rock cycle, which combined with plate tectonics in the mid-twentieth century to give us the great molten-crusting, quaking, all-encircling theory of the Earth, from a gallstone to a 4.5 billion-year-old planet. Now think bigger, take it to biology. Say you see shark teeth in one layer and a fossil of an organism you've never seen under that. The deeper fossil's older, yes? You now have evidence of the origin and extinction of species over time. Get uniformitarian. Maybe a process still active today caused changes not just in rocks but in life. It might also explain similarities and differences between species found by anatomists like Steno. It's a lot to ponder, but Charles Darwin had the time on a long trip to the Galapagos, reading a copy of his friend Charles Lyell's "Principles of Geology," which Steno sort of founded. Sometimes giants stand on the shoulders of curious little people. Nicolas Steno helped evolve evolution, broke ground for geology, and showed how unbiased, empirical observation can cut across intellectual borders to deepen our perspective. His finest accomplishment, though, may be his maxim, casting the search for truth beyond our senses and our current understanding as the pursuit of the beauty of the as yet unknown. Beautiful is what we see, more beautiful is what we know, most beautiful, by far, is what we don't.

**Transcript**:
almost everything Leonardo da Vinci wrote in his journals is back to front and the letters inverted Da Vinci used what's called Mirror writing so was this as the movie claims a deliberate form of code why he wrote backwards because if you are left-handed and you wrote in our Direction you will cover your ink and maybe you have all your ink on your head in your on your arm um so this that's why Leonardo wrote in a mirror way I think the more likely reality was that he discovered that that was something he did with ease Professor Maryanne wolf is a reading and language specialist at tu's University in Boston Massachusetts she doesn't believe Da Vinci being left-handed is the only reason he mirror wrote as a researcher over two decades working with hundreds of children and adults with dyslexia I'm convinced that Leonardo D Vinci was dyslexic dyslexia is an inherited learning disability which impairs people's reading and writing skills the human brain is made up of two hemispheres the right and the left each is a highly specialized region that controls different functions the left hemisphere governs our ability to recognize sequences of words and letters that's why 95% of right-handed people use this hemisphere to communicate the right hemisphere is used to analyze space and geometrical shapes and forms but some left-handed people and dyslexics also use this hemisphere to communicate which could explain why Da Vinci was so brilliant at creating geometric shapes but struggled with spelling Professor wolf believes Leonardo da Vinci mirror wrote because his brain was wired to do so and she's Keen to test her Theory cosmere writing is one of the things that people speculate about we wanted to see well is it easier for dyslexics is it easier for left-handed and can we in this very rude approximation of those four categories can we make some kinds of interesting observations she's going to conduct a simple experiment with four people there are two left-handers and two right-handers in each category one of them is dyslexic they're being asked to transcribe mirror written sentences by timing the volunteers Professor wolf will see who's fastest and in theory who's better neurologically mapped to mirror right what are the times in both tasks the dyslexics are quicker than the others and the left-handers are faster than the right-handers the sample size is too small to confirm maryanne's Theory but it does indicate that left-handed dyslexics are more naturally able to mirror right it also suggests that da Vinci the most prolific mirror writer in history might have been dyslexic and that his mirror writing was the result of a natural neurological process which had nothing to do with codes at all

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the number of hemispheres in the human brain. 

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is related to brain hemispheres but asks about the hemisphere governing sequence recognition. However, Question 13 mentions a specific percentage of right-handed people using the left hemisphere to communicate, which implies the existence of two hemispheres.

But none of these questions directly asks about the number of hemispheres in the human brain. However, Question 4 does mention both hemispheres in its options.

Given the available options, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

However, another approach could be to consider Question 2, which at least deals with hemispheres, and then Question 13, which also mentions hemispheres.

But again, none of these questions is a perfect match.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

However, I must note that Question 4 is not a perfect match.

A better match would be a question that directly asks about the number of hemispheres in the human brain.

Unfortunately, such a question does not exist among the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4.

However, I must note that this is not a perfect match.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4.

So the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4

**Transcript**:
To many, one of the coolest things
about "Game of Thrones" is that the inhabitants
of the Dothraki Sea have their own real language. And Dothraki came hot on the heels of the real language
that the Na'vi speak in "Avatar," which, surely, the Na'vi needed when the Klingons in "Star Trek" have had
their own whole language since 1979. And let's not forget the Elvish languages in J.R.R. Tolkien's
"Lord of the Rings" trilogy, especially since that was
the official grandfather of the fantasy conlangs. "Conlang" is short for
"constructed language." They're more than codes like Pig Latin, and they're not just collections
of fabricated slang like the Nadsat lingo that the teen hoodlums
in "A Clockwork Orange" speak, where "droog" from Russian
happens to mean "friend." What makes conlangs real languages
isn't the number of words they have. It helps, of course,
to have a lot of words. Dothraki has thousands of words. Na'vi started with 1,500 words. Fans on websites
have steadily created more. But we can see the difference
between vocabulary alone and what makes a real language from a look at how Tolkien
put together grand old Elvish, a conlang with several thousands words. After all, you could memorize
5,000 words of Russian and still be barely able
to construct a sentence. A four-year-old would talk
rings around you. That's because you have to know
how to put the words together. That is, a real language has grammar. Elvish does. In English, to make a verb past,
you add an "-ed." Wash, washed. In Elvish, "wash" is "allu" and "washed" is "allune." Real languages also change over time. There's no such thing as a language that's the same today
as it was a thousand years ago. As people speak, they drift
into new habits, shed old ones, make mistakes, and get creative. Today, one says, "Give us today our daily bread." In Old English, they said, "Urne gedaeghwamlican
hlaf syle us todaeg." Things change in conlangs, too. Tolkien charted out ancient
and newer versions of Elvish. When the first Elves awoke at Cuiviénen, in their new language, the word for "people" was "kwendi," but in the language of one of the groups
that moved away, Teleri, over time, "kwendi" became "pendi," with the "k" turning into a "p." And just like real languages,
conlangs like Elvish split off into many. When the Romans transplanted
Latin across Europe, French, Spanish, and Italian were born. When groups move to different places, over time, their ways
of speaking grow apart, just like everything else about them. Thus, Latin's word for hand was "manus," but in French, it became "main," while in Spain it became "mano." Tolkien made sure Elvish
did the same kind of thing. While that original word
"kwendi" became "pendi" among the Teleri, among the Avari, who spread
throughout Middle Earth, it became "kindi"
when the "w" dropped out. The Elvish varieties Tolkien
fleshed out the most are Quenya and Sindarin, and their words are different
in the same way French and Spanish are. Quenya has "suc" for "drink," Sindarin has "sog." And as you know, real languages are messy. That's because they change, and change has a way
of working against order, just like in a living room
or on a bookshelf. Real languages are never
perfectly logical. That's why Tolkien made sure
that Elvish had plenty of exceptions. Lots of verbs are conjugated
in ways you just have to know. Take even the word "know." In the past, it's "knew," which isn't explained
by any of the rules in English. Oh well. In Elvish, "know" is "ista," but "knew" is "sinte." Oh well. The truth is, though, that Elvish
is more a sketch for a real language than a whole one. For Tolkien, Elvish was a hobby rather than an attempt to create something
people could actually speak. Much of the Elvish the characters
in the "Lord of the Rings" movies speak has been made up since Tolkien
by dedicated fans of Elvish based on guesses as to what Tolkien
would have constructed. That's the best we can do for Elvish
because there are no actual Elves around to speak it for us. But the modern conlangs go further. Dothraki, Na'vi, and Klingon
are developed enough that you can actually speak them. Here's a translation
of "Hamlet" into Klingon, although performing it
would mean getting used to pronouncing "k" with your uvula, that weird, cartoony thing hanging
in the back of your throat. Believe it or not, you actually do that
in plenty of languages around the world, like Eskimo ones. Pronouncing Elvish is much easier, though. So, let's take our leave for now from this introduction
to conlangs in Elvish and the other three conlangs discussed with a heartfelt
quad-conlangual valedictory: "A Na Marie!" "Hajas!" Na'vi's "Kiyevame!" "Qapla!" and "Goodbye!"

is more a sketch for a real language than a whole one. For Tolkien, Elvish was a hobby rather than an attempt to create something
people could actually speak. Much of the Elvish the characters
in the "Lord of the Rings" movies speak has been made up since Tolkien
by dedicated fans of Elvish based on guesses as to what Tolkien
would have constructed. That's the best we can do for Elvish
because there are no actual Elves around to speak it for us. But the modern conlangs go further. Dothraki, Na'vi, and Klingon
are developed enough that you can actually speak them. Here's a translation
of "Hamlet" into Klingon, although performing it
would mean getting used to pronouncing "k" with your uvula, that weird, cartoony thing hanging
in the back of your throat. Believe it or not, you actually do that
in plenty of languages around the world, like Eskimo ones. Pronouncing Elvish is much easier, though. So, let's take our leave for now from this introduction
to conlangs in Elvish and the other three conlangs discussed with a heartfelt
quad-conlangual valedictory: "A Na Marie!" "Hajas!" Na'vi's "Kiyevame!" "Qapla!" and "Goodbye!"

**Transcript**:
To many, one of the coolest things
about "Game of Thrones" is that the inhabitants
of the Dothraki Sea have their own real language. And Dothraki came hot on the heels of the real language
that the Na'vi speak in "Avatar," which, surely, the Na'vi needed when the Klingons in "Star Trek" have had
their own whole language since 1979. And let's not forget the Elvish languages in J.R.R. Tolkien's
"Lord of the Rings" trilogy, especially since that was
the official grandfather of the fantasy conlangs. "Conlang" is short for
"constructed language." They're more than codes like Pig Latin, and they're not just collections
of fabricated slang like the Nadsat lingo that the teen hoodlums
in "A Clockwork Orange" speak, where "droog" from Russian
happens to mean "friend." What makes conlangs real languages
isn't the number of words they have. It helps, of course,
to have a lot of words. Dothraki has thousands of words. Na'vi started with 1,500 words. Fans on websites
have steadily created more. But we can see the difference
between vocabulary alone and what makes a real language from a look at how Tolkien
put together grand old Elvish, a conlang with several thousands words. After all, you could memorize
5,000 words of Russian and still be barely able
to construct a sentence. A four-year-old would talk
rings around you. That's because you have to know
how to put the words together. That is, a real language has grammar. Elvish does. In English, to make a verb past,
you add an "-ed." Wash, washed. In Elvish, "wash" is "allu" and "washed" is "allune." Real languages also change over time. There's no such thing as a language that's the same today
as it was a thousand years ago. As people speak, they drift
into new habits, shed old ones, make mistakes, and get creative. Today, one says, "Give us today our daily bread." In Old English, they said, "Urne gedaeghwamlican
hlaf syle us todaeg." Things change in conlangs, too. Tolkien charted out ancient
and newer versions of Elvish. When the first Elves awoke at Cuiviénen, in their new language, the word for "people" was "kwendi," but in the language of one of the groups
that moved away, Teleri, over time, "kwendi" became "pendi," with the "k" turning into a "p." And just like real languages,
conlangs like Elvish split off into many. When the Romans transplanted
Latin across Europe, French, Spanish, and Italian were born. When groups move to different places, over time, their ways
of speaking grow apart, just like everything else about them. Thus, Latin's word for hand was "manus," but in French, it became "main," while in Spain it became "mano." Tolkien made sure Elvish
did the same kind of thing. While that original word
"kwendi" became "pendi" among the Teleri, among the Avari, who spread
throughout Middle Earth, it became "kindi"
when the "w" dropped out. The Elvish varieties Tolkien
fleshed out the most are Quenya and Sindarin, and their words are different
in the same way French and Spanish are. Quenya has "suc" for "drink," Sindarin has "sog." And as you know, real languages are messy. That's because they change, and change has a way
of working against order, just like in a living room
or on a bookshelf. Real languages are never
perfectly logical. That's why Tolkien made sure
that Elvish had plenty of exceptions. Lots of verbs are conjugated
in ways you just have to know. Take even the word "know." In the past, it's "knew," which isn't explained
by any of the rules in English. Oh well. In Elvish, "know" is "ista," but "knew" is "sinte." Oh well. The truth is, though, that Elvish
is more a sketch for a real language than a whole one. For Tolkien, Elvish was a hobby rather than an attempt to create something

Question: The reason PEOPLE is KWENDI in Cuivienen but PENDI in Teleri is

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 13. 

This question is about how Tolkien's Elvish language demonstrates the concept of language change over time, which is related to the ground truth MCQ about why "people" is "kwendi" in Cuiviénen but "pendi" in Teleri. Both questions deal with the idea of language evolution and change in the context of Elvish.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Question 13 is the closest match, but it's still not a perfect match.

If I had to choose another question that's somewhat similar, I would choose Question 8, which is about how conlangs like Elvish and Klingon mimic the evolution of real languages. This question also deals with the idea of language change and evolution, but it's more general and not specific to Elvish.

In any case, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 13.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the ground truth MCQ asks about the completeness of the languages, I re-examined the generated MCQs and found that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 14 is the closest, as it talks about the Klingon language's ability to be spoken, which implies a level of completeness.

But, if I consider the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is to ask about the completeness of the languages, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match it. Nevertheless, I can try to provide an answer based on the available options.

In this case, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 14 is the closest.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 8. 

However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not specifically mention walking or the increase in brain size. 

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the relationship between physical activity (like walking) and brain growth or size.

Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose the closest one based on the general topic of brain health and the effects of lifestyle choices, I would say Question 8 is the closest.

But since question 3 discusses the relationship between brain health and overall well-being which can be considered the most similar to the ground truth question, I will choose it.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 3

[Music] [Music] so can we dare to be optimistic well the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years and hence diverging from the rest of mankind and so the real question to pose is not can we be optimistic it's how can we give credible hope to that billion people that to my mind is the fundamental challenge now of development what I'm going to offer you is a recipe a combination of the two forces that change the world for good which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest compassion because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope that is a human tragedy enlightened self-interest because if that economic Divergence continues for another 40 years combined with social integration globally it will build a nightmare for our children we need compassion to get ourselves started an enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious that's the alliance that changes the world so what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion what can we actually do well a good guide is to think what did we do last time the rich World got serious about developing another region of the world that gives us turns out quite a good clue except you have to go back quite a long time the last time the rich World got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s the rich world was you America and and the region that needed to be developed was my world Europe that was post-war Europe why did America get serious it wasn't just compassion for Europe though there was that it was you knew you had to because in the late 1940s country after country in Central Europe was falling into the Soviet block and so you knew you'd no choice Europe had had to be dragged into Economic Development so what did you do last time you got serious well yes you had a big aid program thank you very much that was martial Aid we need to do it again Aid is part of the solution but what else did you do well you tore up your trade policy and totally reversed it before the war America had been highly protectionist after the war War you open your markets to Europe you drag Europe into the then global economy which was your economy and you institutionalize that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement of tariffs and trade so total reversal of trade policy did you do anything else yes you totally reversed your security policy before the war your security policy had been isolationist after the war you tear that up you put 100,000 troops in Europe for over 40 years so total reversal of security policy anything else yes you tear up the 11th commandment National sovereignty before the war you treated National sovereignty as so sacran that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations after the war you found the United Nations you found the organization for economic cooperation and development you found the IMF you encourage Europe to create the European Community all systems for Mutual governance support that is still the Waterfront of effective policies Aid trade security governments of course the details of policy are going to be different because the challenge is different it's not rebuilding Europe it's re reversing the Divergence of the bottom billion so that they actually catch up is that easier or harder we need to be at least as serious as we were then now today I'm going to take just one of those four I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest the one that's just motherhood and apple pie governance Mutual systems of support for governance and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now the uh opportunity we're going to look to is um is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billian and that is the commodity Booms The commodity booms are pumping un unprecedented amounts of money into many though not all of the countries of the bottom billion partly they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high but it's not just that there's also a range of new discoveries uganda's just discovered oil and about the most disastrous location on Earth Ghana's discovered oil Guinea has got a huge new exploit exploitation of iron oil coming out of the ground so mass of new discoveries between them these new Revenue flows dwarf Aid just to give you one one example Angola alone is getting $50 billion a year in oil Revenue the entire Aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion so the the the flow of resources from the commodity Booms to the bottom billion are without precedent so there's the optimism the question is how is it going to help their development it's a huge opportunity for transformational development will it be taken so here comes a bit of Science and this is a bit of science I've done since the bottom billion so it's new I've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports and the growth of commodity exporting countries and I've looked globally I've taken all the countries in the world for the last 40 years and looked to see what the relationship is and the the short run say the first 5 to seven years is just great in fact it's hunky dory everything goes up right you get more money because your terms of trade have improved but also that drives up output across the board so GDP goes up a lot fantastic that's the short run and how about the long run come back 15 years later well the short run it's hunky dory but the long run it's Humpty Dumpty you go up in the short run but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all that is not a forecast about how commodity prices go it's a forecast of the consequences the long-term consequences of for growth of an increase in prices so what goes wrong why is there this resource curse as it's called and again I've looked at that and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance the initial level of economic governance when there is orce booms acrew in fact if you've got good enough governance there is no resource boom you go up in the short term and then you go up even more in the long term that's Norway the richest country in Europe it's Australia it's Canada the resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance they still go up in the short run that's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment the best growth rates they've had ever and the question is whether the short run will persist with bad governance historically over the last 40 years it hasn't it's countries like Nigeria which are worse off than if they never had oil so there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term below which you go down just to Benchmark that threshold it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s so the question is are the bottom Billy and a above or below that threshold now there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s and that is the spread of democracy so I thought well maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy so I looked democracy does have significant effects and unfortunately they're adverse democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies at that stage I just wanted to abandon the research but it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that because there are two distinct aspects of democracy there's electoral competition which determines how you acquire power and there's checks and balances which determine how you use power it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy where our strong checks and balances make resource booms good and so what the countries of the botom billion need is very strong checks and balances they haven't got them they got instant democracy in the 1990s elections without checks and balances how can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances in all the societies of the bottom billion there are intense struggles to do just that the simple proposal is that we should have some International standards which would be voluntary but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order for to harness these resource revenues we know these International standards work because we've already got one it's called the extractive industries transparency initiative that is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have no sooner was it proposed than reformers in Nigeria adopted it pushed it published the revenues in the paper Nigerian newspaper circulation spiked people wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of Revenue so we know it works what would the content be of these International standards I can't go through all of them but I'll give you an example the first is how to take the resources out of the ground the economic process is taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the ground and the first step in that is selling the rights to Resource extraction you know how rights to Resource extraction are being sold at the moment how they've been sold over the last 40 years a company flies in does a deal with a minister and that's great for the company and it's quite often great for the minister right and it's not great for the country there's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that and it's called verified auctions the uh the public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury that is the British Treasury and the British treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth it worked out worth2 billion just in time a set of economists got there and said why not try an auction it'll reveal the value it went for2 billion through auction if the British treasury can be out by a factor of 10 think what the Ministry of Finance in Sierra Leon is going to be like when I put that to the president of Sierra Leon the next day he asked the World Bank to send in a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions there are five such decision Points each one needs an international standard if we could do it we would change the world we would be helping the reformers in these societies who are struggling for change that's our modest role we cannot change these societies but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing because the odds are so stacked against them and yet we've not got these rules if you think about it the cost of promulgating international rules is Sil nothing why on Earth are they not there I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies politicians will get away with gestures the the that unless we have an informed Society what politicians do especially in relation to Africa is gestures things that look good but don't work and so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry that's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach however I have to say the process of communication does not come naturally to me this is why I'm on this stage but it's alarming right I grew up in a culture uh of self effacement um my wife showed me a a Blog comment on one of my last talks and the blog comment said Kia is not charismatic but his arguments are compelling [Applause] if if you agree with that sentiment and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry you will realize that I'm need you please become ambassadors thank [Applause] [Applause] you

[Music] [Music] so can we dare to be optimistic well the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years and hence diverging from the rest of mankind and so the real question to pose is not can we be optimistic it's how can we give credible hope to that billion people that to my mind is the fundamental challenge now of development what I'm going to offer you is a recipe a combination of the two forces that change the world for good which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest compassion because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope that is a human tragedy enlightened self-interest because if that economic Divergence continues for another 40 years combined with social integration globally it will build a nightmare for our children we need compassion to get ourselves started an enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious that's the alliance that changes the world so what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion what can we actually do well a good guide is to think what did we do last time the rich World got serious about developing another region of the world that gives us turns out quite a good clue except you have to go back quite a long time the last time the rich World got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s the rich world was you America and and the region that needed to be developed was my world Europe that was post-war Europe why did America get serious it wasn't just compassion for Europe though there was that it was you knew you had to because in the late 1940s country after country in Central Europe was falling into the Soviet block and so you knew you'd no choice Europe had had to be dragged into Economic Development so what did you do last time you got serious well yes you had a big aid program thank you very much that was martial Aid we need to do it again Aid is part of the solution but what else did you do well you tore up your trade policy and totally reversed it before the war America had been highly protectionist after the war War you open your markets to Europe you drag Europe into the then global economy which was your economy and you institutionalize that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement of tariffs and trade so total reversal of trade policy did you do anything else yes you totally reversed your security policy before the war your security policy had been isolationist after the war you tear that up you put 100,000 troops in Europe for over 40 years so total reversal of security policy anything else yes you tear up the 11th commandment National sovereignty before the war you treated National sovereignty as so sacran that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations after the war you found the United Nations you found the organization for economic cooperation and development you found the IMF you encourage Europe to create the European Community all systems for Mutual governance support that is still the Waterfront of effective policies Aid trade security governments of course the details of policy are going to be different because the challenge is different it's not rebuilding Europe it's re reversing the Divergence of the bottom billion so that they actually catch up is that easier or harder we need to be at least as serious as we were then now today I'm going to take just one of those four I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest the one that's just motherhood and apple pie governance Mutual systems of support for governance and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now the uh opportunity we're going to look to is um is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billian and that is the commodity Booms The commodity booms are pumping un unprecedented amounts of money into many though not all of the countries of the bottom billion partly they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high but it's not just that there's also a range of new discoveries uganda's just discovered oil and about the most disastrous location on Earth Ghana's discovered oil Guinea has got a huge new exploit exploitation of iron oil coming out of the ground so mass of new discoveries between them these new Revenue flows dwarf Aid just to give you one one example Angola alone is getting $50 billion a year in oil Revenue the entire Aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion so the the the flow of resources from the commodity Booms to the bottom billion are without precedent so there's the optimism the question is how is it going to help their development it's a huge opportunity for transformational development will it be taken so here comes a bit of Science and this is a bit of

competition which determines how you acquire power and there's checks and balances which determine how you use power it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy where our strong checks and balances make resource booms good and so what the countries of the botom billion need is very strong checks and balances they haven't got them they got instant democracy in the 1990s elections without checks and balances how can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances in all the societies of the bottom billion there are intense struggles to do just that the simple proposal is that we should have some International standards which would be voluntary but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order for to harness these resource revenues we know these International standards work because we've already got one it's called the extractive industries transparency initiative that is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have no sooner was it proposed than reformers in Nigeria adopted it pushed it published the revenues in the paper Nigerian newspaper circulation spiked people wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of Revenue so we know it works what would the content be of these International standards I can't go through all of them but I'll give you an example the first is how to take the resources out of the ground the economic process is taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the ground and the first step in that is selling the rights to Resource extraction you know how rights to Resource extraction are being sold at the moment how they've been sold over the last 40 years a company flies in does a deal with a minister and that's great for the company and it's quite often great for the minister right and it's not great for the country there's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that and it's called verified auctions the uh the public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury that is the British Treasury and the British treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth it worked out worth2 billion just in time a set of economists got there and said why not try an auction it'll reveal the value it went for2 billion through auction if the British treasury can be out by a factor of 10 think what the Ministry of Finance in Sierra Leon is going to be like when I put that to the president of Sierra Leon the next day he asked the World Bank to send in a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions there are five such decision Points each one needs an international standard if we could do it we would change the world we would be helping the reformers in these societies who are struggling for change that's our modest role we cannot change these societies but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing because the odds are so stacked against them and yet we've not got these rules if you think about it the cost of promulgating international rules is Sil nothing why on Earth are they not there I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies politicians will get away with gestures the the that unless we have an informed Society what politicians do especially in relation to Africa is gestures things that look good but don't work and so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry that's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach however I have to say the process of communication does not come naturally to me this is why I'm on this stage but it's alarming right I grew up in a culture uh of self

[Music] [Music] so can we dare to be optimistic well the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years and hence diverging from the rest of mankind and so the real question to pose is not can we be optimistic it's how can we give credible hope to that billion people that to my mind is the fundamental challenge now of development what I'm going to offer you is a recipe a combination of the two forces that change the world for good which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest compassion because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope that is a human tragedy enlightened self-interest because if that economic Divergence continues for another 40 years combined with social integration globally it will build a nightmare for our children we need compassion to get ourselves started an enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious that's the alliance that changes the world so what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion what can we actually do well a good guide is to think what did we do last time the rich World got serious about developing another region of the world that gives us turns out quite a good clue except you have to go back quite a long time the last time the rich World got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s the rich world was you America and and the region that needed to be developed was my world Europe that was post-war Europe why did America get serious it wasn't just compassion for Europe though there was that it was you knew you had to because in the late 1940s country after country in Central Europe was falling into the Soviet block and so you knew you'd no choice Europe had had to be dragged into Economic Development so what did you do last time you got serious well yes you had a big aid program thank you very much that was martial Aid we need to do it again Aid is part of the solution but what else did you do well you tore up your trade policy and totally reversed it before the war America had been highly protectionist after the war War you open your markets to Europe you drag Europe into the then global economy which was your economy and you institutionalize that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement of tariffs and trade so total reversal of trade policy did you do anything else yes you totally reversed your security policy before the war your security policy had been isolationist after the war you tear that up you put 100,000 troops in Europe for over 40 years so total reversal of security policy anything else yes you tear up the 11th commandment National sovereignty before the war you treated National sovereignty as so sacran that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations after the war you found the United Nations you found the organization for economic cooperation and development you found the IMF you encourage Europe to create the European Community all systems for Mutual governance support that is still the Waterfront of effective policies Aid trade security governments of course the details of policy are going to be different because the challenge is different it's not rebuilding Europe it's re reversing the Divergence of the bottom billion so that they actually catch up is that easier or harder we need to be at least as serious as we were then now today I'm going to take just one of those four I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest the one that's just motherhood and apple pie governance Mutual systems of support for governance and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now the uh opportunity we're going to look to is um is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billian and that is the commodity Booms The commodity booms are pumping un unprecedented amounts of money into many though not all of the countries of the bottom billion partly they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high but it's not just that there's also a range of new discoveries uganda's just discovered oil and about the most disastrous location on Earth Ghana's discovered oil Guinea has got a huge new exploit exploitation of iron oil coming out of the ground so mass of new discoveries between them these new Revenue flows dwarf Aid just to give you one one example Angola alone is getting $50 billion a year in oil Revenue the entire Aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion so the the the flow of resources from the commodity Booms to the bottom billion are without precedent so there's the optimism the question is how is it going to help their development it's a huge opportunity for transformational development will it be taken so here comes a bit of Science and this is a bit of science I've done since the bottom billion so it's new I've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports and the growth of commodity exporting countries and I've looked globally I've taken all the countries in the world for the last 40 years and looked to see what the relationship is and the the short run say the first 5 to seven years is just great in fact it's hunky dory everything goes up right you get more money because your terms of trade have improved but also that drives up output across the board so GDP goes up a lot fantastic that's the short run and how about the long run come back 15 years later well the short run it's hunky dory but the long run it's Humpty Dumpty you go up in the short run but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all that is not a forecast about how commodity prices go it's a forecast of the consequences the long-term consequences of for growth of an increase in prices so what goes wrong why is there this resource curse as it's called and again I've looked at that and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance the initial level of economic governance when there is orce booms acrew in fact if you've got good enough governance there is no resource boom you go up in the short term and then you go up even more in the long term that's Norway the richest country in Europe it's Australia it's Canada the resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance they still go up in the short run that's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment the best growth rates they've had ever and the question is whether the short run will persist with bad governance historically over the last 40 years it hasn't it's countries like Nigeria which are worse off than if they never had oil so there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term below which you go down just to Benchmark that threshold it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s so the question is are the bottom Billy and a above or below that threshold now there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s and that is the spread of democracy so I thought well maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy so I looked democracy does have significant effects and unfortunately they're adverse democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies at that stage I just wanted to abandon the research but it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that because there are two distinct aspects of democracy there's electoral competition which determines how you acquire power and there's checks and balances which determine how you use power it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy where our strong checks and balances make resource booms good and so what the countries of the botom billion need is very strong checks and balances they haven't got them they got instant

**Transcript**:
English, like all languages, is a messy business. You can be uncouth but not couth. You can be ruthless, but good luck trying to show somebody that you have ruth unless you happen to be married to someone named Ruth. It's bad to be unkempt but impossible to be kempt, or sheveled as opposed to disheveled. There are other things that make no more sense than those but that seem normal now because the sands of time have buried where they came from. For example, did you ever wonder why a nickname for Edward is Ned? Where'd the N come from? It's the same with Nellie for Ellen. Afterall, if someone's name is Ethan, we don't nickname him Nethan, nor do we call our favorite Maria, Nmaria. In fact, if anyone did, our primary urge would be to either scold them or gently hide them away until the company had departed. All these nicknames trace back to a mistake, although, a perfectly understandable one. In fact, even the word nickname is weird. What's so "nick" about a nickname? Is it that it's a name that has a nick in it? Let's face it, not likely. Actually, in Old English, the word was ekename, and eke meant also or other. You can see eke still used in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in a sentence like, "Whan Zephyrus eek with his sweete breeth," which meant, "When Zephyr also with his sweet breath." Ekename meant "also name." What happened was that when people said, "an ekename," it could sound like they were saying, "a nekename," and after a while, so many people were hearing it that way that they started saying, "That's my nickname," instead of, "That's my ekename." Now, the word had a stray n at the front that started as a mistake, but from now on was what the word really was. It was rather as if you had gum on the bottom of your shoe and stepped on a leaf, dragged that leaf along for the rest of your life, were buried wearing that shoe and went to heaven in it to spend eternity wedded to that stray, worn-out leaf. Ekename picked up an n and never let it go. The same thing happened with other words. Old English speakers cut otches into wood. But after centuries of being asked to cut an otch into something, it was easy to think you were cutting a notch instead, and pretty soon you were. In a world where almost no one could read, it was easier for what people heard to become, after awhile, what it started to actually be. Here's where the Ned-style nicknames come in. Old English was more like German than our English is now, and just as in German, my is mein, in Old English, my was meen. You would say meen book, actually boke in Old English, or meen cat. And just as today, we might refer to our child as my Dahlia or my Laura, in Old English, they would say, "Meen Ed". That is mein Ed, mein Ellie. You see where this is going. As time passed, meen morphed into the my we know today. That meant that when people said, "Mein Ed," it sounded like they were saying my Ned. That is, it sounded like whenever someone referred to Edward affectionately, they said Ned instead of Ed. Behold, the birth of a nickname! Or an ekename. Hence, also Nellie for Ellen and Nan for Ann, and even in the old days, Nabby for Abigal. President John Adam's wife Abigail's nickname was Nabby. All sorts of words are like this. Old English speakers wore naprons, but a napron sounds like an apron, and that gave birth to a word apron that no one in Beowulf would have recognized. Umpire started as numpires, too. If all of this sounds like something sloppy that we modern people would never do, then think about something you hear all the time and probably say, "A whole nother." What's nother? We have the word another, of course, but it's composed of an and other, or so we thought. Yet, when we slide whole into the middle, we don't say, "a whole other," we clip that n off of the an and stick it to other and create a new word, nother. For a long time, nobody was writing these sort of things down or putting them in a dictionary, but that's only because writing is more codified now than it was 1,000 years ago. So, when you see a weird word, remember that there might be a whole nother side to the story.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

This question is about the relationship between the pronunciation of words and their evolution over time. The correct option states that the pronunciation of words can influence their evolution, as changes in pronunciation can lead to changes in meaning and usage. This matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which asks how words picked up an extra 'n'. The correct option in the ground truth MCQ is that the word that came before it (in this case, "an" before "ekename") influenced the pronunciation and led to the addition of the 'n'. 

While the questions are not identical, they both deal with the idea that pronunciation can influence the evolution of words, making Question 7 the most similar generated MCQ.

You can be ruthless, but good luck trying to show somebody that you have ruth unless you happen to be married to someone named Ruth. It's bad to be unkempt but impossible to be kempt, or sheveled as opposed to disheveled. There are other things that make no more sense than those but that seem normal now because the sands of time have buried where they came from. For example, did you ever wonder why a nickname for Edward is Ned? Where'd the N come from? It's the same with Nellie for Ellen. Afterall, if someone's name is Ethan, we don't nickname him Nethan, nor do we call our favorite Maria, Nmaria. In fact, if anyone did, our primary urge would be to either scold them or gently hide them away until the company had departed. All these nicknames trace back to a mistake, although, a perfectly understandable one. In fact, even the word nickname is weird. What's so "nick" about a nickname? Is it that it's a name that has a nick in it? Let's face it, not likely. Actually, in Old English, the word was ekename, and eke meant also or other. You can see eke still used in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in a sentence like, "Whan Zephyrus eek with his sweete breeth," which meant, "When Zephyr also with his sweet breath." Ekename meant "also name." What happened was that when people said, "an ekename," it could sound like they were saying, "a nekename," and after a while, so many people were hearing it that way that they started saying, "That's my nickname," instead of, "That's my ekename." Now, the word had a stray n at the front that started as a mistake, but from now on was what the word really was. It was rather as if you had gum on the bottom of your shoe and stepped on a leaf, dragged that leaf along for the rest of your life, were buried wearing that shoe and went to heaven in it to spend eternity wedded to that stray, worn-out leaf. Ekename picked up an n and never let it go. The same thing happened with other words. Old English speakers cut otches into wood. But after centuries of being asked to cut an otch into something, it was easy to think you were cutting a notch instead, and pretty soon you were. In a world where almost no one could read, it was easier for what people heard to become, after awhile, what it started to actually be. Here's where the Ned-style nicknames come in. Old English was more like German than our English is now, and just as in German, my is mein, in Old English, my was meen. You would say meen book, actually boke in Old English, or meen cat. And just as today, we might refer to our child as my Dahlia or my Laura, in Old English, they would say, "Meen Ed". That is mein Ed, mein Ellie. You see where this is going. As time passed, meen morphed into the my we know today. That meant that when people said, "Mein Ed," it sounded like they were saying my Ned. That is, it sounded like whenever someone referred to Edward affectionately, they said Ned instead of Ed. Behold, the birth of a nickname! Or an ekename. Hence, also Nellie for Ellen and Nan for Ann, and even in the old days, Nabby for Abigal. President John Adam's wife Abigail's nickname was Nabby. All sorts of words are like this. Old English speakers wore naprons, but a napron sounds like an apron, and that gave birth to a word apron that no one in Beowulf would have recognized. Umpire started as numpires, too. If all of this sounds like something sloppy that we modern people would never do, then think about something you hear all the time and probably say, "A whole nother." What's nother? We have the word another, of course, but it's composed of an and other, or so we thought. Yet, when we slide whole into the middle, we don't say, "a whole other," we clip that n off of the an and stick it to other and create a new word, nother. For a long time, nobody was writing these sort of things down or putting them in a dictionary, but that's only because writing is more codified now than it was 1,000 years ago. So, when you see a weird word, remember that there might be a whole nother side to the story.

English, like all languages, is a messy business. You can be uncouth but not couth. You can be ruthless, but good luck trying to show somebody that you have ruth unless you happen to be married to someone named Ruth. It's bad to be unkempt but impossible to be kempt, or sheveled as opposed to disheveled. There are other things that make no more sense than those but that seem normal now because the sands of time have buried where they came from. For example, did you ever wonder why a nickname for Edward is Ned? Where'd the N come from? It's the same with Nellie for Ellen. Afterall, if someone's name is Ethan, we don't nickname him Nethan, nor do we call our favorite Maria, Nmaria. In fact, if anyone did, our primary urge would be to either scold them or gently hide them away until the company had departed. All these nicknames trace back to a mistake, although, a perfectly understandable one. In fact, even the word nickname is weird. What's so "nick" about a nickname? Is it that it's a name that has a nick in it? Let's face it, not likely. Actually, in Old English, the word was ekename, and eke meant also or other.

Now, the word had a stray n at the front that started as a mistake, but from now on was what the word really was. It was rather as if you had gum on the bottom of your shoe and stepped on a leaf, dragged that leaf along for the rest of your life, were buried wearing that shoe and went to heaven in it to spend eternity wedded to that stray, worn-out leaf. Ekename picked up an n and never let it go. The same thing happened with other words. Old English speakers cut otches into wood. But after centuries of being asked to cut an otch into something, it was easy to think you were cutting a notch instead, and pretty soon you were. In a world where almost no one could read, it was easier for what people heard to become, after awhile, what it started to actually be. Here's where the Ned-style nicknames come in. Old English was more like German than our English is now, and just as in German, my is mein, in Old English, my was meen. You would say meen book, actually boke in Old English, or meen cat. And just as today, we might refer to our child as my Dahlia or my Laura, in Old English, they would say, "Meen Ed". That is mein Ed, mein Ellie. You see where this is going. As time passed, meen morphed into the my we know today. That meant that when people said, "Mein Ed," it sounded like they were saying my Ned. That is, it sounded like whenever someone referred to Edward affectionately, they said Ned instead of Ed. Behold, the birth of a nickname! Or an ekename. Hence, also Nellie for Ellen and Nan for Ann, and even in the old days, Nabby for Abigal. President John Adam's wife Abigail's nickname was Nabby. All sorts of words are like this. Old English speakers wore naprons, but a napron sounds like an apron, and that gave birth to a word apron that no one in Beowulf would have recognized. Umpire started as numpires, too. If all of this sounds like something sloppy that we modern people would never do, then think about something you hear all the time and probably say, "A whole nother." What's nother? We have the word another, of course, but it's composed of an and other, or so we thought. Yet, when we slide whole into the middle, we don't say, "a whole other," we clip that n off of the an and stick it to other and create a new word, nother. For a long time, nobody was writing these sort of things down or putting them in a dictionary, but that's only because writing is more codified now than it was 1,000 years ago. So, when you see a weird word, remember that there might be a whole nother side to the story.

**Transcript**:
In 1977, the physicist Edward Purcell calculated that if you push
a bacteria and then let go, it will stop in about
a millionth of a second. In that time, it will have traveled less
than the width of a single atom. The same holds true for a sperm
and many other microbes. It all has to do with being really small. Microscopic creatures inhabit
a world alien to us, where making it through an inch of water
is an incredible endeavor. But why does size matter
so much for a swimmer? What makes the world of a sperm
so fundamentally different from that of a sperm whale? To find out, we need to dive
into the physics of fluids. Here's a way to think about it. Imagine you are swimming in a pool. It's you and a whole bunch
of water molecules. Water molecules outnumber you
a thousand trillion trillion to one. So, pushing past them
with your gigantic body is easy, but if you were really small, say you were about the size
of a water molecule, all of a sudden, it's like you're swimming in a pool of people. Rather than simply swishing by
all the teeny, tiny molecules, now every single water molecule is like another person
you have to push past to get anywhere. In 1883, the physicist Osborne Reynolds figured out that there is
one simple number that can predict how a fluid will behave. It's called the Reynolds number, and it depends on simple properties
like the size of the swimmer, its speed, the density of the fluid, and the stickiness,
or the viscosity, of the fluid. What this means is that creatures
of very different sizes inhabit vastly different worlds. For example, because of its huge size, a sperm whale inhabits
the large Reynolds number world. If it flaps its tail once, it can coast ahead
for an incredible distance. Meanwhile, sperm live
in a low Reynolds number world. If a sperm were to stop flapping its tail, it wouldn't even coast past a single atom. To imagine what it would
feel like to be a sperm, you need to bring yourself down
to its Reynolds number. Picture yourself in a tub of molasses
with your arms moving about as slow as the minute
hand of a clock, and you'd have a pretty good idea
of what a sperm is up against. So, how do microbes
manage to get anywhere? Well, many don't bother swimming at all. They just let the food drift to them. This is somewhat like a lazy cow that waits for the grass
under its mouth to grow back. But many microbes do swim, and this is where those
incredible adaptations come in. One trick they can use
is to deform the shape of their paddle. By cleverly flexing their paddle to create more drag on the power stroke
than on the recovery stroke, single-celled organisms like paramecia manage to inch their way
through the crowd of water molecules. But there's an even more
ingenious solution arrived at by bacteria and sperm. Instead of wagging
their paddles back and forth, they wind them like a cork screw. Just as a cork screw on a wine bottle converts winding motion
into forward motion, these tiny creatures
spin their helical tails to push themselves forward in a world where water
feels as thick as cork. Other strategies are even stranger. Some bacteria take Batman's approach. They use grappling hooks
to pull themselves along. They can even use this grappling hook like a sling shot
and fling themselves forward. Others use chemical engineering. H. pylori lives only
in the slimy, acidic mucus inside our stomachs. It releases a chemical
that thins out the surrounding mucus, allowing it to glide through slime. Maybe it's no surprise that these guys are also responsible
for stomach ulcers. So, when you look really closely
at our bodies and the world around us, you can see all sorts of tiny creatures finding clever ways to get around
in a sticky situation. Without these adaptations,
bacteria would never find their hosts, and sperms would never
make it to their eggs, which means you would never
get stomach ulcers, but you would also never be born
in the first place. (Pop)

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that Question 11 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ. 

The ground truth MCQ asks about the strategies used by microbes to get around, and the correct option is "All of the above strategies are used by different microbes." 

Question 11 asks about the factors to be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of different microbial adaptations in various environments, and the correct option is "All of the above." 

Although the questions are not identical, they both deal with the idea of considering multiple factors or strategies related to microbial locomotion. However, it's worth noting that there isn't a perfect match between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar one, I would say it's Question 11, but with a caveat that it's not a perfect match.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

However, it's worth noting that Question 8 doesn't perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it doesn't specifically ask about the distance a sperm would travel if it stopped moving its tail. Nevertheless, it does highlight the contrast between the large Reynolds number world of sperm whales and the low Reynolds number world of sperm, which is closely related to the concept presented in the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate match would be a question that directly asks about the distance a sperm would travel if it stopped moving its tail, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although Question 7 does not directly ask about comparing the Reynolds numbers of two different-sized swimmers, it addresses the relationship between the size of a swimmer and the Reynolds number, which is the core concept behind the ground truth MCQ. The correct option for Question 7 states that the size of the swimmer directly affects its ability to move through a fluid due to the Reynolds number, which implies that larger swimmers would have larger Reynolds numbers.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 7, but I would recommend generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ. 

If you would like me to generate new MCQs, I can try to create some that more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1977, the physicist Edward Purcell calculated that if you push
a bacteria and then let go, it will stop in about
a millionth of a second. In that time, it will have traveled less
than the width of a single atom. The same holds true for a sperm
and many other microbes. It all has to do with being really small. Microscopic creatures inhabit
a world alien to us, where making it through an inch of water
is an incredible endeavor. But why does size matter
so much for a swimmer? What makes the world of a sperm
so fundamentally different from that of a sperm whale? To find out, we need to dive
into the physics of fluids. Here's a way to think about it. Imagine you are swimming in a pool. It's you and a whole bunch
of water molecules. Water molecules outnumber you
a thousand trillion trillion to one. So, pushing past them
with your gigantic body is easy, but if you were really small, say you were about the size
of a water molecule, all of a sudden, it's like you're swimming in a pool of people. Rather than simply swishing by
all the teeny, tiny molecules, now every single water molecule is like another person
you have to push past to get anywhere. In 1883, the physicist Osborne Reynolds figured out that there is
one simple number that can predict how a fluid will behave. It's called the Reynolds number, and it depends on simple properties
like the size of the swimmer, its speed, the density of the fluid, and the stickiness,
or the viscosity, of the fluid. What this means is that creatures
of very different sizes inhabit vastly different worlds. For example, because of its huge size, a sperm whale inhabits
the large Reynolds number world. If it flaps its tail once, it can coast ahead
for an incredible distance. Meanwhile, sperm live
in a low Reynolds number world. If a sperm were to stop flapping its tail, it wouldn't even coast past a single atom. To imagine what it would
feel like to be a sperm, you need to bring yourself down
to its Reynolds number. Picture yourself in a tub of molasses
with your arms moving about as slow as the minute
hand of a clock, and you'd have a pretty good idea
of what a sperm is up against. So, how do microbes
manage to get anywhere? Well, many don't bother swimming at all. They just let the food drift to them. This is somewhat like a lazy cow that waits for the grass
under its mouth to grow back. But many microbes do swim, and this is where those
incredible adaptations come in. One trick they can use
is to deform the shape of their paddle. By cleverly flexing their paddle to create more drag on the power stroke
than on the recovery stroke, single-celled organisms like paramecia manage to inch their way
through the crowd of water molecules. But there's an even more
ingenious solution arrived at by bacteria and sperm. Instead of wagging
their paddles back and forth, they wind them like a cork screw. Just as a cork screw on a wine bottle converts winding motion
into forward motion, these tiny creatures
spin their helical tails to push themselves forward in a world where water
feels as thick as cork. Other strategies are even stranger. Some bacteria take Batman's approach. They use grappling hooks
to pull themselves along. They can even use this grappling hook like a sling shot
and fling themselves forward. Others use chemical engineering. H. pylori lives only
in the slimy, acidic mucus inside our stomachs. It releases a chemical
that thins out the surrounding mucus, allowing it to glide through slime. Maybe it's no surprise that these guys are also responsible
for stomach ulcers. So, when you look really closely
at our bodies and the world around us, you can see all sorts of tiny creatures finding clever ways to get around
in a sticky situation. Without these adaptations,
bacteria would never find their hosts, and sperms would never
make it to their eggs, which means you would never
get stomach ulcers, but you would also never be born
in the first place. (Pop)

**Transcript**:
what I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea and in particular I want to talk about the design of diarrhea and it's and when evolutionary biologists talk about design they are they really mean designed by natural selection and that brings me to the title of the talk using evolution to design disease organisms intelligently and I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this yeah but I'm not just doing this to be cute I really think that the subtitle explains what somebody like me is sort of a Darwin wannabe how they are to look at one's role in sort of coming into this field of Health Sciences in medicine it's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists you actually see a great potential but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf and and may actually be very resistant to try to resistant when one tries to introduce ideas so all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions one is it why are some disease organisms more harmful in a very closely related question which is how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answered the first question how can we make the harmful organisms more mild and I'm really talking to begin with as I said about diarrheal disease organisms and the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease is to think about the problem from a germs point of view germ side view and in particular to think about a fundamental idea which I think makes sense out of tremendous amount of variation in the variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms and that idea is that from the germs my point of view disease organisms have to get from one host to another and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host but not always sometimes you get disease organisms that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission and when you have that then evolutionary soup theory tells us that natural selection favor the more exploitative more predator like organisms so natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility then we expect that the winners the competition will be the milder organisms so if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active natural selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own reproductive success but if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen then it's the benign ones that are tend to be the winners so I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases sterile disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways they can be transmitted from person person contact person to food then to person contact when somebody eats contaminated food or they can be transmitted through the water and when they're transmitted through the water unlike the first two modes of transmission these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission a person can be sick in bed and still infect tens even hundreds of other individuals to sort of illustrate that this diagram emphasizes that if you got a sick person in bed somebody is going to be taking out the contaminated materials they're going to wash those contaminated materials and then the water may move into sources of drinking water people will come into the those places where you've got contaminated drinking water bring things back to the family may drink right at that point the whole point is that a person who can't move can still infect many other individuals and so the theory tells us that when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water we expect them to be more predator like more harmful and you can test these ideas so one way you can test you should look at all diarrhea bacteria and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water tend to be more harmful and the answer is yep they are and I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs but the main point here is is that the lot of them here I can tell the main point here is that those data points are show a very strong positive association between the degree to which the disease organism is transmitted by water and how harmful they are how how much death they caused per untreated infection so this suggests we're on the right track but this to me suggests that we really need to ask some additional questions remember the second question that I raised in the outset was how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild now this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of that graph but it doesn't tell you how long I mean if if this would require thousands of years then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens but if it could occur in just a few years then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control in other words we we just suggest that we could domesticate these organisms we could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us and so as I was thinking about this I focused on this organism which is the alt or bio type of the organism called Vibrio cholerae and that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera and the reason I thought this is a really great organism look at is that we understand why it's so harmful it's harmful because it produces a toxin and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract it causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen the the internal chamber of our intestine and then that fluid goes on when we can which is out the other end and it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the vibrios so what happens if you've got an organism produces a lot of toxin after a few days of infection you end up having you have to fecal material really isn't it's so disgusting as we might imagine it's sort of cloudy water and if you took a drop of that water you might find a million diarrhea organisms if if the organism produced a lot of toxin you might find ten million or 100 known it didn't prove a lot of this toxin then you might find a smaller number so the the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission thereby allowing the organism only be transmitted by person-to-person contact or person food person contact both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission now I can think of some of some possible experiments one would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism something a lot of toxins something produced a little and take those strains and spew them out in different countries some countries that might have clean water supplies they so you can't get waterborne transmission you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there other countries in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness right there's a little ethical problem in this experiment yeah I hope I was I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least that makes me worried a little bit but anyhow the laughter can makes me feel a little bit better and this ethical problems a big problem just to emphasize this this is what we're really talking about here's a girl's almost dead she got rehydration therapy she's being cooked up within a few days she was looking like a completely different person so we don't want to run an experiment like that but interestingly just that thing happened in 1991 1991 this cholera organism got into Lima Peru and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas now I didn't have I don't know how that happened and I didn't have anything to do with that I promise you I don't think anybody knows but I'm not averse to to once that's happened to see whether or not the prediction that we would make that I did make before actually holds up did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile which has some of the most well protected water supplies in Latin America and did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador which has some of the least well protected and Peru's got something sort of in-between and so with funding from those at Krueger Foundation I got a lot of strains from these different countries and I met we measure their toxin production in the lab and we found that in Chile within two months of the invasion of Peru you had strains entering Chile and when you look at those strains in the very upper left hand side of this graph you see a lot of variation in their toxin production each dot corresponds to an isolate from a different person a lot of variation on which natural selection act can act but the interesting point is if you look over the 1990s within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild they evolved to produce less toxin and to just give you a sense of how important this might be if we look in 1995 we find that there's only one case of caller on average reported from Chile every two years so it's controlled apology that's not much we have in America a cholera that's acquired endemically and we don't think we've got a problem here they didn't they solved the problem in Chile but before we get too confident we've got to look at some of those other countries make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve towards mildness well improve it didn't and in Ecuador remember this is the place where there's the highest potential waterborne transmission it looked like it got more harmful in every case there's a lot of variation but something about the environment that people are living in and I think that the only realistic explanation is that it's the the degree of waterborne transmission favored the harmful strains in one place in mild strains in another so this is very encouraging it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow if he had enough money could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck it would make these organisms evolve to mildness so that even though people might be getting infected they could be infected of mild strains that wouldn't be causing severe disease but there's another really interesting aspect of this and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence evolution of harmfulness then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance and the idea is very simple if you've got a harmful organism a high proportion the people are going to be symptomatic high proportions people going to be going to get antibiotics you got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance so you get increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance and once you get increased antibiotic resistance the antibiotics are knocking out the harmful strains anymore so you've got a higher level of Maryland so you get this vicious cycle the goal is to turn this around if you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance so we can go to the same countries and look and see did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem if we look in the beginning of 1990s we see again a lot of variation in this case on the y-axis we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity and I won't go into that but we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity and Chile pruin active our know trend across the years but if we look at the end of the 1990s just half a decade later we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem antibiotic sensitivity was going down and in Chile you still had antibiotic sensitivity so it looks like Chile dodged two bullets they got the organism involved the mildness and they got no development of antibiotic resistance now these ideas should apply across the board as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolve to virulence and I want to give you just one more example because we've talked a little bit about malaria in the example I want to deal with this or the idea I wanted to deal with a question is what can we do to try to get the malaria organism evolve to mildness now malaria is transmitted by mosquito and normally if you're infected with malaria and you're feeling sick it makes it even easier for the mosquito to to bite you and you can show just by looking at data and literature that vector borne diseases are more harmful than non vector borne diseases but I think there's a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this in the case of waterborne transmission we'd like to clean up the water supplies see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness in the case of malaria what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses and and the logic is a little more subtle here if your mosquito-proof houses when people get sick they're sitting in bed or the skete above hospitals they're sitting in a hospital bed and the mosquitoes can't get to them so if you're a harmful variant in a place where you've got mosquito proof housing then you're a loser the only pathogen to get transmitted are the ones that are detecting people to feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites so if you were to mosquito-proof houses you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness and there's a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggest that we really should go ahead and do this and that experiment was done in northern Alabama just to give you a little perspective and this I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States which is right there in Louisville Kentucky and this really cool experiment was done about 200 miles south of there in northern Alabama by the Tennessee Valley Authority they had dammed up the Tennessee River that caused the water to back up these electric hydroelectric power and when you get stagnant water you got mosquitoes they found in the in the late 30s ten years after they'd made these dams that the people in northern Alabama were infected with malaria about a third of the third to half of them are infected with malaria guys it shows the positions of some of these dams okay so the Tennessee Valley Authority was a little bit of a bind there wasn't DDT there wasn't chloric winds what did they do well they decided a mosquito poof every house northern Alabama so they did they divided northern Alabama in 11 zones and within three years about $100 per house they mesquite approved every house and these are the data every row across here represents one of those 11 zones and the asterisks represent the time at which the mosquito proofing was complete and so what you can see is that just the mosquito proofing housing and nothing else caused the eradication of malaria and this was incidentally published in 1949 in the leading textbook of malaria called Boyd's malaria ology but almost no malaria experts even though it exists this is important because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses now I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places like you know sub tear and just as you get into the malaria zone it's up to in Africa but as you move to really intense biting right areas like Nigeria you're probably not certainly not going to Radek eight but that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness so to me it's just an experiment that's waiting to happen if it confirms the prediction then we should be you should have a very powerful tool in a way much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at because most of what's being done today is to rely on things like anti malarial drugs and we know that although it's great to make those anti malarial drugs available in really low cost and high high frequency we know that with when you make no highly available you're going to get resistance to those drugs and so it's a short-term solution this is this long-term solution what I'm suggesting here is we could get evolution working in the direction we want it to go rather than always having to battle evolution is a problem that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen for example with anti malarial drugs so this table I've given just to emphasize that I've only talked about two examples but as I said earlier this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases and it ought to because when we're dealing with infectious diseases we're dealing with living systems we're dealing with living we're dealing with systems that evolve and so if you do something those systems they're going to evolve one way or other and all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve so that we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go so I don't really have time to talk about those things but I did want to put them up there just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that were confronted with and and this this links up with a lot of the other ideas have been talked about so for example earlier today we you know there's a discussion of how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV what this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how to lower it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area it may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more faithful departments and so on but the key thing is to figure out how to lower it because if we lower it we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus and the data really do support this that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness and that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts so the other thing I really like about this besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease is that often the kinds of interventions that you want to that it indicates should be done are the kind of Vengeance interventions that people want anyhow but people just haven't been able to justify the cost so this is the kind of thing I'm talking about if we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water then I think that we can say let's push the effort into that aspect of the control so that we can actually solve the problem even though if you just look at the frequency of infection you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply you know oh in there and thank you very much you

what I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea and in particular I want to talk about the design of diarrhea and it's and when evolutionary biologists talk about design they are they really mean designed by natural selection and that brings me to the title of the talk using evolution to design disease organisms intelligently and I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this yeah but I'm not just doing this to be cute I really think that the subtitle explains what somebody like me is sort of a Darwin wannabe how they are to look at one's role in sort of coming into this field of Health Sciences in medicine it's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists you actually see a great potential but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf and and may actually be very resistant to try to resistant when one tries to introduce ideas so all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions one is it why are some disease organisms more harmful in a very closely related question which is how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answered the first question how can we make the harmful organisms more mild and I'm really talking to begin with as I said about diarrheal disease organisms and the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease is to think about the problem from a germs point of view germ side view and in particular to think about a fundamental idea which I think makes sense out of tremendous amount of variation in the variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms and that idea is that from the germs my point of view disease organisms have to get from one host to another and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host but not always sometimes you get disease organisms that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission and when you have that then evolutionary soup theory tells us that natural selection favor the more exploitative more predator like organisms so natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility then we expect that the winners the competition will be the milder organisms so if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active natural selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own reproductive success but if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen then it's the benign ones that are tend to be the winners so I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases sterile disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways they can be transmitted from person person contact person to food then to person contact when somebody eats contaminated food or they can be transmitted through the water and when they're transmitted through the water unlike the first two modes of transmission these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission a person can be sick in bed and still infect tens even hundreds of other individuals to sort of illustrate that this diagram emphasizes that if you got a sick person in bed somebody is going to be taking out the contaminated materials they're going to wash those contaminated materials and then the water may move into sources of drinking water people will come into the those places where you've got contaminated drinking water bring things back to the family may drink right at that point the whole point is that a person who can't move can still infect many other individuals and so the theory tells us that when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water we expect them to be more predator like more harmful and you can test these ideas so one way you can test you should look at all diarrhea bacteria and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water tend to be more harmful and the answer is yep they are and I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs but the main point here is is that the lot of them here I can tell the main point here is that those data points are show a very strong positive association between the degree to which the disease organism is transmitted by water and how harmful they are how how much death they caused per untreated infection so this suggests we're on the right track but this to me suggests that we really need to ask some additional questions remember the second question that I raised in the outset was how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild now this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of that graph but it doesn't tell you how long I mean if if this would require thousands of years then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens but if it could occur in just a few years then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control in other words we we just suggest that we could domesticate these organisms we could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us and so as I was thinking about this I focused on this organism which is the alt or bio type of the organism called Vibrio cholerae and that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera and the reason I thought this is a really great organism look at is that we understand why it's so harmful it's harmful because it produces a toxin and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract it causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen the the internal chamber of our intestine and then that fluid goes on when we can which is out the other end and it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the vibrios so what happens if you've got an organism produces a lot of toxin after a few days of infection you end up having you have to fecal material really isn't it's so disgusting as we might imagine it's sort of cloudy water and if you took a drop of that water you might find a million diarrhea organisms if if the organism produced a lot of toxin you might find ten million or 100 known it didn't prove a lot of this toxin then you might find a smaller number so the the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission thereby allowing the organism only be transmitted by person-to-person contact or person food person contact both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission now I can think of some of some possible experiments one would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism something a lot of toxins something produced a little and take those strains and spew them out in different countries some countries that might have clean water supplies they so you can't get waterborne transmission you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there other countries in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness right there's a little ethical problem in this experiment yeah I hope I was I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least that makes me worried a little bit but anyhow the laughter can makes me feel a little bit better and this ethical problems a big problem just to emphasize this this is what we're really talking about here's a girl's almost dead she got rehydration therapy she's being cooked up within a few days she was looking like a completely different person so we don't want to run an experiment like that but interestingly just that thing happened in 1991 1991 this cholera organism got into Lima Peru and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas now I didn't have I don't know how that happened and I didn't have anything to do with that I promise you I don't think anybody knows but I'm not averse to to once that's happened to see whether or not the prediction that we would make that I did make before actually holds up did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile which has some of the most well protected water supplies in Latin America and did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador which has some of the least well protected and Peru's got something sort of in-between and so with funding from those at Krueger Foundation I got a lot of strains from these different countries and I met we measure their toxin production in the lab and we found that in Chile within two months of the invasion of Peru you had strains entering Chile and when you look at those strains in the very upper left hand side of this graph you see a lot of variation in their toxin production each dot corresponds to an isolate from a different person a lot of variation on which natural selection act can act but the interesting point is if you look over the 1990s within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild they evolved to produce less toxin and to just give you a sense of how important this might be if we look in 1995 we find that there's only one case of caller on average reported from Chile every two years so it's controlled apology that's not much we have in America a cholera that's acquired endemically and we don't think we've got a problem here they didn't they solved the problem in Chile but before we get too confident we've got to look at some of those other countries make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve towards mildness well improve it didn't and in Ecuador remember this is the place where there's the highest potential waterborne transmission it looked like it got more harmful in every case there's a lot of variation but something about the environment that people are living in and I think that the only realistic explanation is that it's the the degree of waterborne transmission favored the harmful strains in one place in mild strains in another so this is very encouraging it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow if he had enough money could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck it would make these organisms evolve to mildness so that even though people might be getting infected they could be infected of mild strains that wouldn't be causing severe disease but there's another really interesting aspect of this and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence evolution of harmfulness then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance and the idea is very simple if you've got a harmful organism a high proportion the people are going to be symptomatic high proportions people going to be going to get antibiotics you got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance so you get increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance and once you get increased antibiotic resistance the antibiotics are knocking out the harmful strains anymore so you've got a higher level of Maryland so you get this vicious cycle the goal is to turn this around if you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance so we can go to the same countries and look and see did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem if we look in the beginning of 1990s we see again a lot of variation in this case on the y-axis we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity and I won't go into that but we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity and Chile pruin active our know trend across the years but if we look at the end of the 1990s just half a decade later we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem antibiotic sensitivity was going down and in Chile you still had antibiotic sensitivity so it looks like Chile dodged two bullets they got the organism involved the mildness and they got no development of antibiotic resistance now these ideas should apply across the board as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolve to virulence and I want to give you just one more example because we've talked a little bit about malaria in the example I want to deal with this or the idea I wanted to deal with a question is what can we do to try to get the malaria organism evolve to mildness now malaria is transmitted by mosquito and normally if you're infected with malaria and you're feeling sick it makes it even easier for the mosquito to to bite you and you can show just by looking at data and literature that vector borne diseases are more harmful than non vector borne diseases but I think there's a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this in the case of waterborne transmission we'd like to clean up the water supplies see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness in the case of malaria what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses and and the logic is a little more subtle here if your mosquito-proof houses when people get sick they're sitting in bed or the skete above hospitals they're sitting in a hospital bed and the mosquitoes can't get to them so if you're a harmful variant in a place where you've got mosquito proof housing then you're a loser the only pathogen to get transmitted are the ones that are detecting people to feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites so if you were to mosquito-proof houses you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness and there's a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggest that we really should go ahead and do this and that experiment was done in northern Alabama just to give you a little perspective and this I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States which is right there in Louisville Kentucky and this really cool experiment was done about 200 miles south of there in northern Alabama by the Tennessee Valley Authority they had dammed up the Tennessee River that caused the water to back up these electric hydroelectric power and when you get stagnant water you got mosquitoes they found in the in the late 30s ten years after they'd made these dams that the people in northern Alabama were infected with malaria about a third of the third to half of them are infected with malaria guys it shows the positions of some of these dams okay so the Tennessee Valley Authority was a little bit of a bind there wasn't DDT there wasn't chloric winds what did they do well they decided a mosquito poof every house northern Alabama so they did they divided northern Alabama in 11 zones and within three years about $100 per house they mesquite approved every house and these are the data every row across here represents one of those 11 zones and the asterisks represent the time at which the mosquito proofing was complete and so what you can see is that just the mosquito proofing housing and nothing else caused the eradication of malaria and this was incidentally published in 1949 in the leading textbook of malaria called Boyd's malaria ology but almost no malaria experts even though it exists this is important because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses now I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places like you know sub tear and just as you get into the malaria zone it's up to in Africa but as you move to really intense biting right areas like Nigeria you're probably not certainly not going to Radek eight but that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness so to me it's just an experiment that's waiting to happen if it confirms the prediction then we should be you should have a very powerful tool in a way much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at because most of what's being done today is to rely on things like anti malarial drugs and we know that although it's great to make those anti malarial drugs available in really low cost and high high frequency we know that with when you make no highly available you're going to get resistance to those drugs and so it's a short-term solution this is this long-term solution what I'm suggesting here is we could get evolution working in the direction we want it to go rather than always having to battle evolution is a

[Music] [Applause] there is nothing bigger older than the universe the questions I would like to talk about our one where did we come from how did the universe come into being are we alone in the universe is there alien life out there what is the future of the human race up until the 1920s everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time then it was discovered that the universe was expanding distant galaxies were moving away from us this meant they must have been closer together in the past if we extrapolate back we find they must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago this was the Big Bang the beginning of the universe but was there anything before the Big Bang if not what created a universe why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts first there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determine the evolution of the universe given its state over all space at one time one second there was no question of the initial state of the universe we have made good progress on the first part and now have a knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions but until recently we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe however this division into laws of evolution an initial ditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct under extreme conditions general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space this removes a distinction between time and space and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state the universe can spontaneously created self out of nothing moreover we can calculate the probability that the universe is created in different states these predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the Cosmic Microwave Background which is an imprint of the very early universe we think we have solved the mystery of creation maybe we should patent the universe encourage everyone royalties for their existence I now turned on the second big question are we alone or is there other life in the universe we believe that life arose spontaneously on the earth so it must be possible for life to appear another suitable planets of which there seemed to be a large number in the galaxy but we don't know how life first appeared we have two pieces of observational evidence and the probability of life appearing the first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago the earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years so life appeared on earth within half a billion years of it being possible which is short compared to the ten billion year lifetime of a planet of earth type the suggests that the probability of life appearing is recently high if it was very low one would have expected it to take most of the 10 billion years available on the other hand we don't seem to have been visited by aliens I am discounting reports of UFOs why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos if there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far furthermore despite an extensive search by the SETI project we have heard any alien television quiz shows this probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet this brings me to the last of the big questions the future of the human race if we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy we should make sure we survive and continue but we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history our population in our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill but our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were a survival advantage in the past it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years let alone the next thousand or million our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain in red lurking on planet earth but to spread out into space the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years but if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years our futures in space that is why I'm in favor of manned or should I say person'd space flight all my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap indeed it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue a quest for knowledge the ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe and we are making good progress thank you for listening professor if you had to guess either way do you now believe that it is more likely than not but we are alone in the Milky Way as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher this this answer took seven minutes and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for Ted I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years otherwise we would have heard radio waves the alternative is that civilizations don't last very long but destroyed themselves professor Hawking thank you for that answer we will take it as a salutary warning I think for the rest of our conference this week professor we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today thank you very much indeed [Applause] you

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, the most similar generated MCQ would be one that discusses the timeline of a significant event or discovery related to the universe.

Since none of the generated MCQs specifically mention the timeline of when people thought the universe was static, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of discussing the timeline of the universe.

The most similar generated MCQ is:
Question 1: What is the approximate age of the universe? Options: A. 10 billion years, B. 15 billion years, C. 20 billion years, D. 25 billion years Correct Option: B

However, please note that this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. It would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say:

[Music] [Applause] there is nothing bigger older than the universe the questions I would like to talk about our one where did we come from how did the universe come into being are we alone in the universe is there alien life out there what is the future of the human race up until the 1920s everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time then it was discovered that the universe was expanding distant galaxies were moving away from us this meant they must have been closer together in the past if we extrapolate back we find they must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago this was the Big Bang the beginning of the universe but was there anything before the Big Bang if not what created a universe why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts first there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determine the evolution of the universe given its state over all space at one time one second there was no question of the initial state of the universe we have made good progress on the first part and now have a knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions but until recently we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe however this division into laws of evolution an initial ditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct under extreme conditions general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space this removes a distinction between time and space and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state the universe can spontaneously created self out of nothing moreover we can calculate the probability that the universe is created in different states these predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the Cosmic Microwave Background which is an imprint of the very early universe we think we have solved the mystery of creation maybe we should patent the universe encourage everyone royalties for their existence I now turned on the second big question are we alone or is there other life in the universe we believe that life arose spontaneously on the earth so it must be possible for life to appear another suitable planets of which there seemed to be a large number in the galaxy but we don't know how life first appeared we have two pieces of observational evidence and the probability of life appearing the first is that we have fossils

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 1 is asking about the age of the universe, not the Earth, it's not a perfect match.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the age of the Earth. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, although it's not an exact match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 1 (with the caveat that it's not an exact match)

If I were to generate a new MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

Question: The Earth formed _______ years ago.
Options: A. 1 billion, B. 4.6 billion, C. 10.8 million, D. 500 million

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and tone.

The ground truth MCQ is about Hawking joking about an alien abduction, specifically mentioning an insurance policy.

The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but it's related to the topic of extraterrestrial life and the search for it. However, one question that has a similar tone and theme is:

Question 6: What can the search for extraterrestrial life inform our understanding of? Options: A. The probability of life emerging on other planets., B. The probability of intelligent life existing on other planets., C. The probability of life existing only on Earth., D. The probability of the universe's origin.

However, this is not a good match.

A better match would be a question that directly references Hawking's joke about alien abduction. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this criteria.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

However, if you'd like me to choose an index, I would say that the closest match (although not a good one) would be:

 Question 8: What is contrasted with the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial life? Options: A. The probability of life emerging on Mars., B. The probability of life emerging on Earth., C. The probability of intelligent life existing on other planets., D. The probability of civilizations self-destructing.

[Music] [Applause] there is nothing bigger older than the universe the questions I would like to talk about our one where did we come from how did the universe come into being are we alone in the universe is there alien life out there what is the future of the human race up until the 1920s everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time then it was discovered that the universe was expanding distant galaxies were moving away from us this meant they must have been closer together in the past if we extrapolate back we find they must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago this was the Big Bang the beginning of the universe but was there anything before the Big Bang if not what created a universe why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts first there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determine the evolution of the universe given its state over all space at one time one second there was no question of the initial state of the universe we have made good progress on the first part and now have a knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions but until recently we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe however this division into laws of evolution an initial ditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct under extreme conditions general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space this removes a distinction between time and space and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state the universe can spontaneously created self out of nothing moreover we can calculate the probability that the universe is created in different states these predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the Cosmic Microwave Background which is an imprint of the very early universe we think we have solved the mystery of creation maybe we should patent the universe encourage everyone royalties for their existence I now turned on the second big question are we alone or is there other life in the universe we believe that life arose spontaneously on the earth so it must be possible for life to appear another suitable planets of which there seemed to be a large number in the galaxy but we don't know how life first appeared we have two pieces of observational evidence and the probability of life appearing the first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago the earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years so life appeared on earth within half a billion years of it being possible which is short compared to the ten billion year lifetime of a planet of earth type the suggests that the probability of life appearing is recently high if it was very low one would have expected it to take most of the 10 billion years available on the other hand we don't seem to have been visited by aliens I am discounting reports of UFOs why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos if there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far furthermore despite an extensive search by the SETI project we have heard any alien television quiz shows this probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet this brings me to the last of the big questions the future of the human race if we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy we should make sure we survive and continue but we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history our population in our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill but our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were a survival advantage in the past it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years let alone the next thousand or million our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain in red lurking on planet earth but to spread out into space the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years but if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years our futures in space that is why I'm in favor of manned or should I say person'd space flight all my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap indeed it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue a quest for knowledge the ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe and we are making good progress thank you for listening professor if you had to guess either way do you now believe that it is more likely than not but we are alone in the Milky Way as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher this this answer took seven minutes and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for Ted I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years otherwise we would have heard radio waves the alternative is that civilizations don't last very long but destroyed themselves professor Hawking thank you for that answer we will take it as a salutary warning I think for the rest of our conference this week professor we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today thank you very much indeed [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
Each spring, nature lovers eagerly greet the signs that winter is finally coming to an end. As the days grow warmer, the flowers and trees start to bloom, and the world comes alive with the melodious call of birds in search of a new mate. But where have these enchanting sounds been hiding all winter? For almost 200 species of song birds, their winters have been spent down in the tropical climates of Central and South America. While this may sound ideal, it involves one of the most perilous journeys known in the entire animal kingdom. This journey is called migration, and for song birds, this can involve travelling somewhere between a few hundred to almost 7,000 miles in a period of several weeks to four months. Birds spend weeks preparing for the intense journey by gorging on large quantities of food, sometimes doubling their weight prior to departure. While flying, birds can lose almost one percent of their body weight an hour, so packing on the pounds is crucial to their survival. However, more than the physical stress, migrating birds are now facing a new source of hardship: landscape change. Just imagine you're the one getting ready to take a trip. You've packed the car with everything you think you need, fueled up the tank, eaten a huge breakfast, and hit the road. You've taken this journey before. You know all your favorite rest stops and little back-alley diners to grab a bite. Everything is planned out. But just as your fuel gauge starts dipping into the red zone, you pass by what should have been a gas station, except it's closed. "Not a problem," you think, "The next one can't be too far away." But then that next station never appears. Unfortunately, as you continue on your route, the reality of the situation starts to set in. More and more stations are closed or just erased from your map. All of a sudden, your routine trip has become a desperate search just to find somewhere safe to rest and refuel for the night. This scenario has become the reality for the majority of migrating song birds as human land development continues unchecked. Humans are altering important stop-over sites that birds have been using for generations. As migrators pass over the continent, they run a gauntlet of dangers, including pesticide ingestion in rural farmlands, habitat loss in suburban developments, as well as disorientation from light pollution, and even structure collision with tall, reflective glass buildings in cities. Of the estimated 20 billion individual birds that comprise the fall population, only about half will return to breed the following spring. Almost one billion of these deaths are attributed just to building collisions. With such astounding yearly losses, humans risk more than just the loss of the beautiful colors and songs of birds, they also play an important role in the ecosystem. Birds help with insect control, pollination, and disbursing seeds throughout the landscape. Without birds, the natural world would be a very different place. Although birds face an on-going threat from human land development, there are actions that we can all take to help. Many countries and local governements have already passed important laws that restrict the use of poisonous pesticides. By using more natural, plant-based products, we can maintain our farms and gardens without the dangerous side effects. In addition, as our global populations continue to grow and people need places to call home, green spaces can offer both bird habitat as well as a peaceful and natural place for us to enjoy. Small changes at home can also make a huge difference. By hanging up feeders and building bird houses in outdoor areas, we can provide much-needed food and safety during long migrations. Turning out lights in suburban and urban environments can also help birds that look for stars to navigate. With our help, these sky travellers can reach their destination safely, and hopefully keep returning year after year.

**Transcript**:
Each spring, nature lovers eagerly greet the signs that winter is finally coming to an end. As the days grow warmer, the flowers and trees start to bloom, and the world comes alive with the melodious call of birds in search of a new mate. But where have these enchanting sounds been hiding all winter? For almost 200 species of song birds, their winters have been spent down in the tropical climates of Central and South America. While this may sound ideal, it involves one of the most perilous journeys known in the entire animal kingdom. This journey is called migration, and for song birds, this can involve travelling somewhere between a few hundred to almost 7,000 miles in a period of several weeks to four months. Birds spend weeks preparing for the intense journey by gorging on large quantities of food, sometimes doubling their weight prior to departure. While flying, birds can lose almost one percent of their body weight an hour, so packing on the pounds is crucial to their survival. However, more than the physical stress, migrating birds are now facing a new source of hardship: landscape change. Just imagine you're the one getting ready to take a trip. You've packed the car with everything you think you need, fueled up the tank, eaten a huge breakfast, and hit the road. You've taken this journey before. You know all your favorite rest stops and little back-alley diners to grab a bite. Everything is planned out. But just as your fuel gauge starts dipping into the red zone, you pass by what should have been a gas station, except it's closed. "Not a problem," you think, "The next one can't be too far away." But then that next station never appears. Unfortunately, as you continue on your route, the reality of the situation starts to set in. More and more stations are closed or just erased from your map. All of a sudden, your routine trip has become a desperate search just to find somewhere safe to rest and refuel for the night. This scenario has become the reality for the majority of migrating song birds as human land development continues unchecked. Humans are altering important stop-over sites that birds have been using for generations. As migrators pass over the continent, they run a gauntlet of dangers, including pesticide ingestion in rural farmlands, habitat loss in suburban developments, as well as disorientation from light pollution, and even structure collision with tall, reflective glass buildings in cities. Of the estimated 20 billion individual birds that comprise the fall population, only about half will return to breed the following spring. Almost one billion of these deaths are attributed just to building collisions. With such astounding yearly losses, humans risk more than just the loss of the beautiful colors and songs of birds, they also play an important role in the ecosystem. Birds help with insect control, pollination, and disbursing seeds throughout the landscape. Without birds, the natural world would be a very different place. Although birds face an on-going threat from human land development, there are actions that we can all take to help. Many countries and local governements have already passed important laws that restrict the use of poisonous pesticides. By using more natural, plant-based products, we can maintain our farms and gardens without the dangerous side effects. In addition, as our global populations continue to grow and people need places to call home, green spaces can offer both bird habitat as well as a peaceful and natural place for us to enjoy. Small changes at home can also make a huge difference. By hanging up feeders and building bird houses in outdoor areas, we can provide much-needed food and safety during long migrations. Turning out lights in suburban and urban environments can also help birds that look for stars to navigate. With our help, these sky travellers can reach their destination safely, and hopefully keep returning year after year.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can suggest a related question.

The ground truth MCQ is about the number of bird deaths caused by building collisions. While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 12 is related to the topic of bird collisions with buildings.

However, if I had to choose a question that is closest in terms of providing a specific statistic, I would choose Question 2, which asks about the estimated number of individual birds that comprise the fall population. This question is not directly related to building collisions but does provide a statistic about bird populations.

But since neither of these questions directly matches the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is most closely related to the topic of bird deaths. In this case, I would suggest Question 4 or Question 5, which discuss the impact of human land development on migrating song birds, including dangers such as pesticide ingestion, habitat loss, and structure collision.

However, I must reiterate that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say Question 4 is the closest in terms of discussing the dangers faced by migrating song birds, which includes building collisions.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever heard the sound of frogs calling at night? For hundreds of millions of years, this croaking lullaby has filled the nighttime air. But recent studies suggest that these frogs are in danger of playing their final note. Over the past few decades, amphibian populations have been rapidly disappearing worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's amphibian species are endanger of extinction, and over 100 species have already disappeared. But don't worry, there's still hope. Before we get into how to save the frogs, let's start by taking a look at why they're disappearing and why it's important to keep them around. Habitat destruction is the number one problem for frog populations around the world. There are seven billion humans on the planet, and we compete with frogs for habitat. We build cities, suburbs, and farms on top of frog habitat and chop forests and drain the wetlands that serve as home for numerous amphibian populations. Climate change alters precipitation levels, drying up ponds, streams, and cloud forests. As the Earth's human population continues to grow, so will the threats amphibians face. There are a variety of other factors contributing to the frogs' decline. Over-harvesting for the pet and food trade results in millions of frogs being taken out of the wild each year. Invasive species, such as non-native trout and crawfish, eat native frogs. Humans are facilitating the spread of infectious diseases by shipping over 100 million amphibians around the world each year for use as food, pets, bait, and in laboratories and zoos, with few regulations or quarantines. One of these diseases, chytridiomycosis, has driven stream-dwelling amphibian populations to extinction in Africa, Australia, Europe, and North, Central, and South America. On top of all these problems, we add hundreds of millions of kilograms of pesticides to our ecosystems each year. And these chemicals are easily absorbed through amphibians' permeable skin, causing immunosuppression, or a weakened immune system, and developmental deformities. Okay, so why are these little green guys worth keeping around? Frogs are important for a multitude of reasons. They're an integral part of the food web, eating flies, ticks, mosquitoes, and other disease vectors, thus, protecting us against malaria, dengue fever, and other illnesses. Tadpoles keep waterways clean by feeding on algae, reducing the demand on our community's filtration systems and keeping our cost of water low. Frogs serve as a source of food for birds, fish, snakes, dragonflies, and even monkeys. When frogs disappear, the food web is disturbed, and other animals can disappear as well. Amphibians are also extremely important in human medicine. Over ten percent of the Nobel prizes in physiology and medicine have gone to researchers whose work depended on amphibians. Some of the antimicrobial peptides on frog skin can kill HIV, some act as pain killers, and others serve as natural mosquito repellents. Many discoveries await us if we can save the frogs, but when a frog species disappears, so does any promise it holds for improving human health. Fortunately, there are lots of ways you can help, and the best place to start is by improving your ecological footprint and day-to-day actions. The next time you listen to that nighttime lullaby, don't think of it as just another background noise, hear it as a call for help, sung in perfect croaking harmony.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever heard the sound of frogs calling at night? For hundreds of millions of years, this croaking lullaby has filled the nighttime air. But recent studies suggest that these frogs are in danger of playing their final note. Over the past few decades, amphibian populations have been rapidly disappearing worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's amphibian species are endanger of extinction, and over 100 species have already disappeared. But don't worry, there's still hope. Before we get into how to save the frogs, let's start by taking a look at why they're disappearing and why it's important to keep them around. Habitat destruction is the number one problem for frog populations around the world. There are seven billion humans on the planet, and we compete with frogs for habitat. We build cities, suburbs, and farms on top of frog habitat and chop forests and drain the wetlands that serve as home for numerous amphibian populations. Climate change alters precipitation levels, drying up ponds, streams, and cloud forests. As the Earth's human population continues to grow, so will the threats amphibians face. There are a variety of other factors contributing to the frogs' decline. Over-harvesting for the pet and food trade results in millions of frogs being taken out of the wild each year. Invasive species, such as non-native trout and crawfish, eat native frogs. Humans are facilitating the spread of infectious diseases by shipping over 100 million amphibians around the world each year for use as food, pets, bait, and in laboratories and zoos, with few regulations or quarantines. One of these diseases, chytridiomycosis, has driven stream-dwelling amphibian populations to extinction in Africa, Australia, Europe, and North, Central, and South America. On top of all these problems, we add hundreds of millions of kilograms of pesticides to our ecosystems each year. And these chemicals are easily absorbed through amphibians' permeable skin, causing immunosuppression, or a weakened immune system, and developmental deformities. Okay, so why are these little green guys worth keeping around? Frogs are important for a multitude of reasons. They're an integral part of the food web, eating flies, ticks, mosquitoes, and other disease vectors, thus, protecting us against malaria, dengue fever, and other illnesses. Tadpoles keep waterways clean by feeding on algae, reducing the demand on our community's filtration systems and keeping our cost of water low. Frogs serve as a source of food for birds, fish, snakes, dragonflies, and even monkeys. When frogs disappear, the food web is disturbed, and other animals can disappear as well. Amphibians are also extremely important in human medicine. Over ten percent of the Nobel prizes in physiology and medicine have gone to researchers whose work depended on amphibians. Some of the antimicrobial peptides on frog skin can kill HIV, some act as pain killers, and others serve as natural mosquito repellents. Many discoveries await us if we can save the frogs, but when a frog species disappears, so does any promise it holds for improving human health. Fortunately, there are lots of ways you can help, and the best place to start is by improving your ecological footprint and day-to-day actions. The next time you listen to that nighttime lullaby, don't think of it as just another background noise, hear it as a call for help, sung in perfect croaking harmony.

However, this question does not directly address the harm caused by pesticides to frogs. A more relevant question would be one that specifically mentions the impact of pesticides on frogs.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the harm caused by pesticides to frogs. Unfortunately, there isn't a generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, I can suggest a possible match based on the available options:

Question 8 is not a perfect match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of the subject matter. However, since it does not directly address the harm caused by pesticides to frogs, I will try to find a better match.

A better match would be a question that specifically talks about pesticides. However, there isn't a question that is as specific as the ground truth MCQ. Among the provided options, Question 6 is still the closest match.

However, I must note that there is a closer match - Question 6 does contain an option that talks about "reducing pesticide use" which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

But I must admit that I made a mistake - I should have noticed Question 6 does not talk about the harm caused by pesticides. I should have said "there is no match" instead.

Let me correct my previous response - there isn't a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the available options:

 Question 6 does talk about "reducing pesticide use" which is related to the ground truth MCQ, but it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] i'm a bug lover myself not from childhood by the way but rather late uh when i bachelored a major in zoology in tel aviv university i kind of fell in love with bugs and then within zoology i took the course of the discipline of entomology the science of insects and then i thought myself how can i be practical or or help in the science of entomology and then i moved to the world of plant protection plant protection from insects from bedbugs and then within plant protection i came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests so it's a whole discipline in plant protection that aiming at reduction of chemicals and biological pest control by the way or these good bugs that we are talking about they exist in the world for thousands and thousands of years for a long long time but only in the hundred and last hundred and twenty years people started or people knew more and more how to explore how to use this biological control phenomenon or in fact natural control phenomenon to their own needs because biological control phenomena you can see it in your backyard just take a magnifying glass you see what i have here that's a magnifier times 10 yeah times 10 you just open it you just twist leaves and you see a whole new world of by nude insects or little spiders of one millimeter one and a half two meter millimeters long and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones so this phenomenon of of natural control exists literally everywhere here in front of this building i'm sure just have a look at the plants so it's everywhere and we need to know how to exploit it well let us look just hand by hand and browse through just a few examples what is a pest what damage it actually inflicts on the plant and what is the natural enemy the biological control agent or the good bug that we are talking about in general i'm going to talk about insects and spiders or mites let us call them insects those six select organisms and spider or mites the eight lead organisms let's have a look at that here is a pest devastating pest a spider mite because it does a lot of webbing like a spider you see the mother in between and two daughters probably on the left and right and a single egg on the right hand side and then you see what kind of damage it can inflate on your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf and in the middle cotton leaf and on the left tomato leaf with these little stippling they can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking piercing and mouth parts of those spiders but here comes nature that provides us with a good spider this is a predatory mod just as small as the spider mite by the way one millimeter two millimeter long not more than that running quickly hunting chasing the spider mites and here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side just pierces such the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite and after five minutes this is what you see just typical dead corpse shriveled sucked out dead corpse of the spider mite and next to it two satiated individuals of predatory mice and mother on the left-hand side a young myth on the right hand side by the way a meal for them for 24 hours are about five individuals of the spider mites of the bad mites and or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites by the way they are hungry always and there is another example aphids by the way it's springtime now in israel when temperature rises sharply you can see those bad ones those aphids all over the plants in your hibiscus in your lantana on the young fresh foliage of the spring flush so-called by the way with aphids you have only females like amazon's females giving rise to females giving rise to other females no males at all parthenogenesis was so-called and they are very happy with that apparently and here you can see the damage those aphids secrete some sticky sugary liquid called honeydew and this just clogs the upper part of the plant you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of the black fungus mold which is covering it and here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp here we are not talking about the predator here we are talking about a parasite not a two-legged parasite but an eight-legged parasite of yours yeah this is a parasitic wasp again two meters long slender a very quick and sharp flyer and here you can see this parasite in action like in an acrobatic maneuver she stands vis-a-vis in front of the victim on the right-hand side bending his abdomen and inserting a single egg a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid by the way the effect tries to escape she kicks and and bites and secretes different liquids but nothing will happen in fact only the egg of the parasitoid will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid and after a few days depends on upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside and after and this is all natural this is all natural this is not fiction nothing at all again in your backyard in your backyard absolutely this is this is the end result this is the end result mummies m-u-m-y [Music] this is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside in fact a developing parenting toy that after a few minutes you see half way out the birth is almost complete you can see by the way different movies etc and it takes just a few minutes and if this is a female she will immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short this female can live only three to four days and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs that means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids and this is of course not the end of it there is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example again we'll start first with the quest the thrips by the way all these weird names huh i didn't bother you with the latinx of these creatures okay just the popular names but this is a nice slender very bad pest if you can see this sweet peppers this is not just an exotic or a metal sweet pepper this is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those three adults and here comes the natural enemy my note pirate bug my mood because it is rather small yeah you can see the adult black and two young ones and again in action this adult pierces the trips sucking it within just several minutes just going to the other prey continuing all over the place and if we spread those my root pirate bugs the good ones for example in a sweet pepper plot they go to the flowers and look this flower is flooded with predatory bugs with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones the trips so this is a very positive situation by the way no harm to the developing fruit no heart to the fruit set everything is justified under these circumstances but again the question is here you saw them on a one-to-one basis the past the natural enemy what we do is actually this in the northeast israel in kibbutz deliao there is a facility that mass produces those natural enemies in other words what we do there we amplify we amplify the natural control of the biological control phenomenon and in 30 000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses there we are mass producing those predatory mines those mild pirate bugs those parasitic wasps etc etc many different parts by the way they have a very nice landscape you see the jordanian mountains on one hand and they do jordan valley on the other hand and a good mild winter and a nice hot summer which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures by the way mass production it is not genetic manipulation there are no gmos genetically modified organisms whatsoever we take them from nature and the only thing that we do we give them the optimal conditions under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms in order to proliferate multiply and reproduce and that's what we get in fact you see under a microscope you see on the upper left corner you see the single predatory mite and this is a whole bunch of predatory mites you see this apple you see this one i have one gram of those predatory mites one grams 80 000 individuals 80 000 individuals are good enough to control one acre four thousand square meters of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year and we can produce from this believe you me several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis so this is what they call amplification of the phenomenon and no we do we do not disrupt the balance on the contrary because we bring it to agricultural plot where the balance or was already disrupted by the chemicals here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals that's the whole idea and what is the impact in this table you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs for example in israel where we employ more than one thousand hectares ten thousand donuts in israeli terms of biological pest-controlling sweet pepper under protection seventy-five percent of the pesticides were actually reduced and the israelis strawberries even more 80 percent of the pesticide especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries so the impact is very strong and there goes the question especially if you ask growers agriculturalists why biological control why good bugs by the way the number of answers you get equals to the number of people you ask but if we go for example to this place southeast israel the arava valley along the great rift valley where the really top-notch the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located especially under greenhouse conditions or under screen house conditions if you drive all the way to a lot you see this just in the middle of the desert and if you zoom in you can definitely watch this grandparents with their grandchildren distribute the natural enemies the good bugs instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applied chemicals so safety with respect to the application this is number one answer that we get from growers why biological control number two many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals just in our case that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics it's the same and it can happen very quickly fortunately in the biological control or in the natural control resistance is extremely rare it hardly happens because this is evolution this is the natural issue unlike resistance which happens in the case of chemicals and thirdly public demand public demand the more the public the public demands reduction of chemicals more growers become aware of the fact they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control with biological control even here there is another grower you see very interested in the bugs the bad ones and the good ones wearing this magnifier already on her head just walking safely in her crop finally i want to get to actually to my vision or in fact my dream because you see this is the reality have a look at the gap if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide is 250 million dollars and look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world i think it's times 100 or something like that 25 billion so there is a huge gap to bridge so actually how can we do it how can we bridge or let's say never disgrace this gap in the course of the years first of all we need to find more robust good and reliable biological solutions more good bugs that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field secondly to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agriculture of fresh produce and thirdly also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry and this gap really narrows step by step it does never so i think my last slide is all we are saying we can actually see it give nature a chance so i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners and implementers in israel and abroad really give nature a chance thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] i'm a bug lover myself not from childhood by the way but rather late uh when i bachelored a major in zoology in tel aviv university i kind of fell in love with bugs and then within zoology i took the course of the discipline of entomology the science of insects and then i thought myself how can i be practical or or help in the science of entomology and then i moved to the world of plant protection plant protection from insects from bedbugs and then within plant protection i came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests so it's a whole discipline in plant protection that aiming at reduction of chemicals and biological pest control by the way or these good bugs that we are talking about they exist in the world for thousands and thousands of years for a long long time but only in the hundred and last hundred and twenty years people started or people knew more and more how to explore how to use this biological control phenomenon or in fact natural control phenomenon to their own needs because biological control phenomena you can see it in your backyard just take a magnifying glass you see what i have here that's a magnifier times 10 yeah times 10 you just open it you just twist leaves and you see a whole new world of by nude insects or little spiders of one millimeter one and a half two meter millimeters long and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones so this phenomenon of of natural control exists literally everywhere here in front of this building i'm sure just have a look at the plants so it's everywhere and we need to know how to exploit it well let us look just hand by hand and browse through just a few examples what is a pest what damage it actually inflicts on the plant and what is the natural enemy the biological control agent or the good bug that we are talking about in general i'm going to talk about insects and spiders or mites let us call them insects those six select organisms and spider or mites the eight lead organisms let's have a look at that here is a pest devastating pest a spider mite because it does a lot of webbing like a spider you see the mother in between and two daughters probably on the left and right and a single egg on the right hand side and then you see what kind of damage it can inflate on your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf and in the middle cotton leaf and on the left tomato leaf with these little stippling they can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking piercing and mouth parts of those spiders but here comes nature that provides us with a good spider this is a predatory mod just as small as the spider mite by the way one millimeter two millimeter long not more than that running quickly hunting chasing the spider mites and here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side just pierces such the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite and after five minutes this is what you see just typical dead corpse shriveled sucked out dead corpse of the spider mite and next to it two satiated individuals of predatory mice and mother on the left-hand side a young myth on the right hand side by the way a meal for them for 24 hours are about five individuals of the spider mites of the bad mites and or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites by the way they are hungry always and there is another example aphids by the way it's springtime now in israel when temperature rises sharply you can see those bad ones those aphids all over the plants in your hibiscus in your lantana on the young fresh foliage of the spring flush so-called by the way with aphids you have only females like amazon's females giving rise to females giving rise to other females no males at all parthenogenesis was so-called and they are very happy with that apparently and here you can see the damage those aphids secrete some sticky sugary liquid called honeydew and this just clogs the upper part of the plant you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of the black fungus mold which is covering it and here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp here we are not talking about the predator here we are talking about a parasite not a two-legged parasite but an eight-legged parasite of yours yeah this is a parasitic wasp again two meters long slender a very quick and sharp flyer and here you can see this parasite in action like in an acrobatic maneuver she stands vis-a-vis in front of the victim on the right-hand side bending his abdomen and inserting a single egg a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid by the way the effect tries to escape she kicks and and bites and secretes different liquids but nothing will happen in fact only the egg of the parasitoid will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid and after a few days depends on upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside and after and this is all natural this is all natural this is not fiction nothing at all again in your backyard in your backyard absolutely this is this is the end result this is the end result mummies m-u-m-y [Music] this is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside in fact a developing parenting toy that after a few minutes you see half way out the birth is almost complete you can see by the way different movies etc and it takes just a few minutes and if this is a female she will immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short this female can live only three to four days and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs that means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids and this is of course not the end of it there is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example again we'll start first with the quest the thrips by the way all these weird names huh i didn't bother you with the latinx of these creatures okay just the popular names but this is a nice slender very bad pest if you can see this sweet peppers this is not just an exotic or a metal sweet pepper this is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those three adults and here comes the natural enemy my note pirate bug my mood because it is rather small yeah you can see the adult black and two young ones and again in action this adult pierces the trips sucking it within just several minutes just going to the other prey continuing all over the place and if we spread those my root pirate bugs the good ones for example in a sweet pepper plot they go to the flowers and look this flower is flooded with predatory bugs with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones the trips so this is a very positive situation by the way no harm to the developing fruit no heart to the fruit set everything is justified under these circumstances but again the question is here you saw them on a one-to-one basis the past the natural enemy what we do is actually this in the northeast israel in kibbutz deliao there is a facility that mass produces those natural enemies in other words what we do there we amplify we amplify the natural control of the biological control phenomenon and in 30 000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses there we are mass producing those predatory mines those mild pirate bugs those parasitic wasps etc etc many different parts by the way they have a very nice landscape you see the jordanian mountains on one hand and they do jordan valley on the other hand and a good mild winter and a nice hot summer which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures by the way mass production it is not genetic manipulation there are no gmos genetically modified organisms whatsoever we take them from nature and the only thing that we do we give them the optimal conditions under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms in order to proliferate multiply and reproduce and that's what we get in fact you see under a microscope you see on the upper left corner you see the single predatory mite and this is a whole bunch of predatory mites you see this apple you see this one i have one gram of those predatory mites one grams 80 000 individuals 80 000 individuals are good enough to control one acre four thousand square meters of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year and we can produce from this believe you me several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis so this is what they call amplification of the phenomenon and no we do we do not disrupt the balance on the contrary because we bring it to agricultural plot where the balance or was already disrupted by the chemicals here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals that's the whole idea and what is the impact in this table you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs for example in israel where we employ more than one thousand hectares ten thousand donuts in israeli terms of biological pest-controlling sweet pepper under protection seventy-five percent of the pesticides were actually reduced and the israelis strawberries even more 80 percent of the pesticide especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries so the impact is very strong and there goes the question especially if you ask growers agriculturalists why biological control why good bugs by the way the number of answers you get equals to the number of people you ask but if we go for example to this place southeast israel the arava valley along the great rift valley where the really top-notch the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located especially under greenhouse conditions or under screen house conditions if you drive all the way to a lot you see this just in the middle of the desert and if you zoom in you can definitely watch this grandparents with their grandchildren distribute the natural enemies the good bugs instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applied chemicals so safety with respect to the application this is number one answer that we get from growers why biological control number two many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals just in our case that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics it's the same and it can happen very quickly fortunately in the biological control or in the natural control resistance is extremely rare it hardly happens because this is evolution this is the natural issue unlike resistance which happens in the case of chemicals and thirdly public demand public demand the more the public the public demands reduction of chemicals more growers become aware of the fact they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control with biological control even here there is another grower you see very interested in the bugs the bad ones and the good ones wearing this magnifier already on her head just walking safely in her crop finally i want to get to actually to my vision or in fact my dream because you see this is the reality have a look at the gap if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide is 250 million dollars and look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world i think it's times 100 or something like that 25 billion so there is a huge gap to bridge so actually how can we do it how can we bridge or let's say never disgrace this gap in the course of the years first of all we need to find more robust good and reliable biological solutions more good bugs that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field secondly to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agriculture of fresh produce and thirdly also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry and this gap really narrows step by step it does never so i think my last slide is all we are saying we can actually see it give nature a chance so i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners and implementers in israel and abroad really give nature a chance thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] i'm a bug lover myself not from childhood by the way but rather late uh when i bachelored a major in zoology in tel aviv university i kind of fell in love with bugs and then within zoology i took the course of the discipline of entomology the science of insects and then i thought myself how can i be practical or or help in the science of entomology and then i moved to the world of plant protection plant protection from insects from bedbugs and then within plant protection i came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests so it's a whole discipline in plant protection that aiming at reduction of chemicals and biological pest control by the way or these good bugs that we are talking about they exist in the world for thousands and thousands of years for a long long time but only in the hundred and last hundred and twenty years people started or people knew more and more how to explore how to use this biological control phenomenon or in fact natural control phenomenon to their own needs because biological control phenomena you can see it in your backyard just take a magnifying glass you see what i have here that's a magnifier times 10 yeah times 10 you just open it you just twist leaves and you see a whole new world of by nude insects or little spiders of one millimeter one and a half two meter millimeters long and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones so this phenomenon of of natural control exists literally everywhere here in front of this building i'm sure just have a look at the plants so it's everywhere and we need to know how to exploit it well let us look just hand by hand and browse through just a few examples what is a pest what damage it actually inflicts on the plant and what is the natural enemy the biological control agent or the good bug that we are talking about in general i'm going to talk about insects and spiders or mites let us call them insects those six select organisms and spider or mites the eight lead organisms let's have a look at that here is a pest devastating pest a spider mite because it does a lot of webbing like a spider you see the mother in between and two daughters probably on the left and right and a single egg on the right hand side and then you see what kind of damage it can inflate on your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf and in the middle cotton leaf and on the left tomato leaf with these little stippling they can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking piercing and mouth parts of those spiders but here comes nature that provides us with a good spider this is a predatory mod just as small as the spider mite by the way one millimeter two millimeter long not more than that running quickly hunting chasing the spider mites and here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side just pierces such the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite and after five minutes this is what you see just typical dead corpse shriveled sucked out dead corpse of the spider mite and next to it two satiated individuals of predatory mice and mother on the left-hand side a young myth on the right hand side by the way a meal for them for 24 hours are about five individuals of the spider mites of the bad mites and or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites by the way they are hungry always and there is another example aphids by the way it's springtime now in israel when temperature rises sharply you can see those bad ones those aphids all over the plants in your hibiscus in your lantana on the young fresh foliage of the spring flush so-called by the way with aphids you have only females like amazon's females giving rise to females giving rise to other females no males at all parthenogenesis was so-called and they are very happy with that apparently and here you can see the damage those aphids secrete some sticky sugary liquid called honeydew and this just clogs the upper part of the plant you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of the black fungus mold which is covering it and here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp here we are not talking about the predator here we are talking about a parasite not a two-legged parasite but an eight-legged parasite of yours yeah this is a parasitic wasp again two meters long slender a very quick and sharp flyer and here you can see this parasite in action like in an acrobatic maneuver she stands vis-a-vis in front of the victim on the right-hand side bending his abdomen and inserting a single egg a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid by the way the effect tries to escape she kicks and and bites and secretes different liquids but nothing will happen in fact only the egg of the parasitoid will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid and after a few days depends on upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside and after and this is all natural this is all natural this is not fiction nothing at all again in your backyard in your backyard absolutely this is this is the end result this is the end result mummies m-u-m-y [Music] this is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside in fact a developing parenting toy that after a few minutes you see half way out the birth is almost complete you can see by the way different movies etc and it takes just a few minutes and if this is a female she will immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short this female can live only three to four days and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs that means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids and this is of course not the end of it there is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example again we'll start first with the quest the thrips by the way all these weird names huh i didn't bother you with the latinx of these creatures okay just the popular names but this is a nice slender very bad pest if you can see this sweet peppers this is not just an exotic or a metal sweet pepper this is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those three adults and here comes the natural enemy my note pirate bug my mood because it is rather small yeah you can see the adult black and two young ones and again in action this adult pierces the trips sucking it within just several minutes just going to the other prey continuing all over the place and if we spread those my root pirate bugs the good ones for example in a sweet pepper plot they go to the flowers and look this flower is flooded with predatory bugs with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones the trips so this is a very positive situation by the way no harm to the developing fruit no heart to the fruit set everything is justified under these circumstances but again the question is here you saw them on a one-to-one basis the past the natural enemy what we do is actually this in the northeast israel in kibbutz deliao there is a facility that mass produces those natural enemies in other words what we do there we amplify we amplify the natural control of the biological control phenomenon and in 30 000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses there we are mass producing those predatory mines those mild pirate bugs those parasitic wasps etc etc many different parts by the way they have a very nice landscape you see the jordanian mountains on one hand and they do jordan valley on the other hand and a good mild winter and a nice hot summer which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures by the way mass production it is not genetic manipulation there are no gmos genetically modified organisms whatsoever we take them from nature and the only thing that we do we give them the optimal conditions under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms in order to proliferate multiply and reproduce and that's what we get in fact you see under a microscope you see on the upper left corner you see the single predatory mite and this is a whole bunch of predatory mites you see this apple you see this one i have one gram of those predatory mites one grams 80 000 individuals 80 000 individuals are good enough to control one acre four thousand square meters of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year and we can produce from this believe you me several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis so this is what they call amplification of the phenomenon and no we do we do not disrupt the balance on the contrary because we bring it to agricultural plot where the balance or was already disrupted by the chemicals here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals that's the whole idea and what is the impact in this table you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs for example in israel where we employ more than one thousand hectares ten thousand donuts in israeli terms of biological pest-controlling sweet pepper under protection seventy-five percent of the pesticides were actually reduced and the israelis strawberries even more 80 percent of the pesticide especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries so the impact is very strong and there goes the question especially if you ask growers agriculturalists why biological control why good bugs by the way the number of answers you get equals to the number of people you ask but if we go for example to this place southeast israel the arava valley along the great rift valley where the really top-notch the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located especially under greenhouse conditions or under screen house conditions if you drive all the way to a lot you see this just in the middle of the desert and if you zoom in you can definitely watch this grandparents with their grandchildren distribute the natural enemies the good bugs instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applied chemicals so safety with respect to the application this is number one answer that we get from growers why biological control number two many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals just in our case that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics it's the same and it can happen very quickly fortunately in the biological control or in the natural control resistance is extremely rare it hardly happens because this is evolution this is the natural issue unlike resistance which happens in the case of chemicals and thirdly public demand public demand the more the public the public demands reduction of chemicals more growers become aware of the fact they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control with biological control even here there is another grower you see very interested in the bugs the bad ones and the good ones wearing this magnifier already on her head just walking safely in her crop finally i want to get to actually to my vision or in fact my dream because you see this is the reality have a look at the gap if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide is 250 million dollars and look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world i think it's times 100 or something like that 25 billion so there is a huge gap to bridge so actually how can we do it how can we bridge or let's say never disgrace this gap in the course of the years first of all we need to find more robust good and reliable biological solutions more good bugs that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field secondly to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agriculture of fresh produce and thirdly also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry and this gap really narrows step by step it does never so i think my last slide is all we are saying we can actually see it give nature a chance so i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners and implementers in israel and abroad really give nature a chance thank you

that we are talking about they exist in the world for thousands and thousands of years for a long long time but only in the hundred and last hundred and twenty years people started or people knew more and more how to explore how to use this biological control phenomenon or in fact natural control phenomenon to their own needs because biological control phenomena you can see it in your backyard just take a magnifying glass you see what i have here that's a magnifier times 10 yeah times 10 you just open it you just twist leaves and you see a whole new world of by nude insects or little spiders of one millimeter one and a half two meter millimeters long and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones so this phenomenon of of natural control exists literally everywhere here in front of this building i'm sure just have a look at the plants so it's everywhere and we need to know how to exploit it well let us look just hand by hand and browse through just a few examples what is a pest what damage it actually inflicts on the plant and what is the natural enemy the biological control agent or the good bug that we are talking about in general i'm going to talk about insects and spiders or mites let us call them insects those six select organisms and spider or mites the eight lead organisms let's have a look at that here is a pest devastating pest a spider mite because it does a lot of webbing like a spider you see the mother in between and two daughters probably on the left and right and a single egg on the right hand side and then you see what kind of damage it can inflate on your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf and in the middle cotton leaf and on the left tomato leaf with these little stippling they can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking piercing and mouth parts of those spiders but here comes nature that provides us with a good spider this is a predatory mod just as small as the spider mite by the way one millimeter two millimeter long not more than that running quickly hunting chasing the spider mites and here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side just pierces such the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite and after five minutes this is what you see just typical dead corpse shriveled sucked out dead corpse of the spider mite and next to it two satiated individuals of predatory mice and mother on the left-hand side a young myth on the right hand side by the way a meal for them for 24 hours are about five individuals of the spider mites of the bad mites and or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites by the way they are hungry always and there is another example aphids by the way it's springtime now in israel when temperature rises sharply you can see those bad ones those aphids all over the plants in your hibiscus in your lantana on the young fresh foliage of the spring flush so-called by the way with aphids you have only females like amazon's females giving rise to females giving rise to other females no males at all parthenogenesis was so-called and they are very happy with that apparently and here you can see the damage those aphids secrete some sticky sugary liquid called honeydew and this just clogs the upper part of the plant you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of the black fungus mold which is covering it and here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp here we are not talking about the predator here we are talking about a parasite not a two-legged parasite but an eight-legged parasite of yours yeah this is a parasitic wasp again two meters long slender a very quick and sharp flyer and here you can see this parasite in action like in an acrobatic maneuver she stands vis-a-vis in front of the victim on the right-hand side bending his abdomen and inserting a single egg a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid by the way the effect tries to escape she kicks and and bites and secretes different liquids but nothing will happen in fact only the egg of the parasitoid will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid and after a few days depends on upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside and after and this is all natural this is all natural this is not fiction nothing at all again in your backyard in your backyard absolutely this is this is the end result this is the end result mummies m-u-m-y [Music] this is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside in fact a developing parenting toy that after a few minutes you see half way out the birth is almost complete you can see by the way different movies etc and it takes just a few minutes and if this is a female she will immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short this female can live only three to four days and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs that means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids and this is of course not the end of it there is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example again we'll start first with the quest the thrips by the way all these weird names huh i didn't bother you with the latinx of these creatures okay just the popular names but this is a nice slender very bad pest if you can see this sweet peppers this is not just an exotic or a metal sweet pepper this is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those three adults and here comes the natural enemy my note pirate bug my mood because it is rather small yeah you can see the adult black and two young ones and again in action this adult pierces the trips sucking it within just several minutes just going to the other prey continuing all over the place and if we spread those my root pirate bugs the good ones for example in a sweet pepper plot they go to the flowers and look this flower is flooded with predatory bugs with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones the trips so this is a very positive situation by the way no harm to the developing fruit no heart to the fruit set everything is justified under these circumstances but again the question is here you saw them on a one-to-one basis the past the natural enemy what we do is actually this in the northeast israel in kibbutz deliao there is a facility that mass produces those natural enemies in other words what we do there we amplify we amplify the natural control of the biological control phenomenon and in 30 000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses there we are mass producing those predatory mines those mild pirate bugs those parasitic wasps etc etc many different parts by the way they have a very nice landscape you see the jordanian mountains on one hand and they do jordan valley on the other hand and a good mild winter and a nice hot summer which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures by the way mass production it is not genetic manipulation there are no gmos genetically modified organisms whatsoever we take them from nature and the only thing that we do we give them the optimal conditions under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms in order to proliferate multiply and reproduce and that's what we get in fact you see under a microscope you see on the upper left corner you see the single predatory mite and this is a whole bunch of predatory mites you see this apple you see this one i have one gram of those predatory mites one grams 80 000 individuals 80 000 individuals are good enough to control one acre four thousand square meters of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year and we can produce from this believe you me several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis so this is what they call amplification of the phenomenon and no we do we do not disrupt the balance on the contrary because we bring it to agricultural plot where the balance or was already disrupted by the chemicals here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals that's the whole idea and what is the impact in this table you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs for example in israel where we employ more than one thousand hectares ten thousand donuts in israeli terms of biological pest-controlling sweet pepper under protection seventy-five percent of the pesticides were actually reduced and the israelis strawberries even more 80 percent of the pesticide especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries so the impact is very strong and there goes the question especially if you ask growers agriculturalists why biological control why good bugs by the way the number of answers you get equals to the number of people you ask but if we go for example to this place southeast israel the arava valley along the great rift valley where the really top-notch the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located especially under greenhouse conditions or under screen house conditions if you drive all the way to a lot you see this just in the middle of the desert and if you zoom in you can definitely watch this grandparents with their grandchildren distribute the natural enemies the good bugs instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applied chemicals so safety with respect to the application this is number one answer that we get from growers why biological control number two many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals just in our case that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics it's the same and it can happen very quickly fortunately in the biological control or in the natural control resistance is extremely rare it hardly happens because this is evolution this is the natural issue unlike resistance which happens in the case of chemicals and thirdly public demand public demand the more the public the public demands reduction of chemicals more growers become aware of the fact they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control with biological control even here there is another grower you see very interested in the bugs the bad ones and the good ones wearing this magnifier already on her head just walking safely in her crop finally i want to get to actually to my vision or in fact my dream because you see this is the reality have a look at the gap if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide is 250 million dollars and look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world i think it's times 100 or something like that 25 billion so there is a huge gap to bridge so actually how can we do it how can we bridge or let's say never disgrace this gap in the course of the years first of all we need to find more robust good and reliable biological solutions more good bugs that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field secondly to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agriculture of fresh produce and thirdly also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry and this gap really narrows step by step it does never so i think my last slide is all we are saying we can actually see it give nature a chance so i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners and implementers in israel and abroad really give nature a chance thank you

[Music] [Music] my name is Seth preat I'm the chief ninja of scavenger I I am a proud Princeton Dropout also proud to have relocated here to Boston where I actually grew up uh and yeah Boston easy wins I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here so I'm also I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world uh and this is sort of A New Concept and it's really important because while the last decade was the decade of Social and the decade of where the framework in which we connect with other people was built this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior and the framework in which that is constructed uh is decided upon and that's really important and so I say that I want to build a game on top of the world uh but that's not quite true because uh it's already under construction it's already happening uh and it looks like this right now it looks like the web did back in 1997 right it's not very good uh it's cluttered it's filled with lots of different things that in short aren't that fun uh there are credit card schemes and Airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game Dynamics and actually are building the game layer uh they just suck uh they're not very welld designed right so that's unfortunate um but luckily uh as as as my my favorite Action Hero Bob the Builder says uh we can do better we can build this better and the tools the resources that we use to build a game layer are game Dynamics themselves and so sort of the Crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game Dynamics really interesting things that if you use consciously you can use to influence behavior both for good for bad for in between hopefully for good but this is the sort of the the the important stages in which that framework will get built and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now um just before we jump into that there's sort of a question of why is this important I'm sort of making this claim that there is a gameer on top of the world and that it's very important that we build it properly uh the reason that it's so important is that the last decade what we've seen has been building the social lir has been this framework for connections and construction on that lirer is over uh it's finished there's still a lot to explore there's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this but the framework itself is done and it's called Facebook uh and and that's okay right A lot of people are very happy with Facebook I I like it quite a lot they've created this thing called the open graph and they own all of our connections they own half a billion people and so when you want to build on the social Lair the framework has been decided it is the open graph API and if you're happy with that fantastic if you're not too bad there's nothing you can do but this next decade no and and that that's a real thing I mean we want we want to build Frameworks in a way that that makes it it that makes it acceptable and makes it you know productive down the road so the social layer is all about these connections the game layer is all about influence it's not about adding a social fabric to the web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go it's actually about using Dynamics using forces to influence the behavior of where you are what you do there how you do it that's really really powerful and it's going to be more important in the social air it's going to affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly and so it's incredibly critical that at this moment while it's just getting constructed while the Frameworks like Facebook like the open graph are being created for the game Lair equivalent that we think about it very consciously and that we do it in a way that is open that is available and that can be leveraged for good and so that's what I want to talk about for game Dynamics because construction has just begun and the more consciously we can think about this the better we'll be able to use it for anything that we want so uh like I said the way the way that you go through and build on the game layer is not with uh you know glass and steel and cement and the resources that we use are not this two-dimensional swath of land that we have the resources are mind share and the tools the raw materials are these game Dynamics so with that you know a couple game Dynamics to talk about four um back at scavenger we like to joke that with seven game Dynamics you can get anyone to do anything and so today I'm going to show you four uh because I hope to have a competitive Advantage at the end of this still uh so so the first one uh it's a very simple game Dynamic uh it's called the appointment Dynamic and this is a dynamic in which to succeed players have to do something at a predefined time generally at a predefined place uh and these Dynamics are a little scary sometimes because you think you know other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact what I do where I do it when I do it that that this sort of loss of free will that occurs in games can be frightening so with each Dynamic I'm going to give three examples uh one that shows how this is already being used in the real world so you can sort of rationalize it a little bit one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game I think everything is a game but this is sort of more of a you know what you would think is a game played on a you know board or on a computer screen and then one how this can be used for good so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful so the first one the most famous appointment dynamic in the world is something called happy hour uh so so so uh I just recently dropped out of Princeton and actually ended up uh for the first time in a bar and I saw these happy hour things all over the place right and this is simply an appointment Dynamic come here at a certain time get your drinks half off to win all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time uh this game Dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our Behavior it's influenced our entire culture and that that's that's a really scary thought that one game Dynamic can change things so powerfully um it also exists in more conventional game forms I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now if you haven't I recommend playing it you won't do anything else for the rest of your day uh Farmville has more active users than Twitter uh it's incredibly powerful and it has this Dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops fake crops or they Wilt and this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats when they say your Farms your your crops Wilt after 8 hours or after 6 hours or after 24 hours it changes the life cycle of 70 million some people during the day they will return like clockwork at different times so if they wanted the world to end if they wanted productivity to stop they could make this a 30-minute cycle and no one could do anything else right that that's a little scary but but this can also be used for good um this is a local company called vitality and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time right that's an appointment uh it's it's something that people don't do very well and they have these glow caps which you know Flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine uh this is one that isn't a game yet but really should be you should get points for doing this on time you should lose points for not doing this on time they should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment Dynamic and leverage the games and then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways uh we're going to jump on to the next one maybe yes uh influence and Status so so this is one of the most one of the most famous game Dynamics it's used all over the place uh it's used in your wallets right now right we all want that credit card on the far left because it's black and you see someone at CVS or or not CVS like like Christian Dior or something right and then I don't know I don't have a black card I've got a debit card but they but they they so they they whip it out and and you see man they have that black card I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am and and I and I need that uh and this is used in games as well Modern Warfare one of the most successful selling games of all time I'm only a level four but but I desperately you know want to be a level 10 because they've got that cool Red Badge thing and that means that that I am somehow better uh than everyone else and and that's very powerful to me status is a really good motivator um it's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings School uh and remember I made it through one year so I think I'm I'm qualified to talk on School uh is a game it's just not a terribly well-designed game right there are levels there are C there are B There is a there are statuses I mean what is Valedictorian but a status if we called Val valedictorian a you know White Knight Paladin level 20 uh I think people would probably work a lot harder so so so so school is a game and there' have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly but let's use it consciously like why have games that you can lose why go from an A to an F or a B to a c that sucks why not level up and at Princeton they've actually experiment experimented with this where they have quizzes where you gain experience points and you level up from B to an A and and it's very powerful it can be used in interesting ways uh the third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression Dynamic where you have to sort of make progress you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion um this is used all over the place including LinkedIn where um I I am an unho individual I am only 85% complete on LinkedIn and that bothers me and and and this is this is so deep-seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar we will do it we will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen uh this is used in conventional games as well I mean you see you know this is a paladin level 10 and that's a paladin level 20 and and if you were going to fight you know Orcs on the fields of Mordor against the razal ghoul you'd probably want to be the the bigger one right I would uh and so people work very hard to level up um World of Warcraft is one of the most successful games of all time um the average player spend something like six six and a half hours a day on it they most their most dedicated players it's like a full-time job it's it's insane and they have these systems where you can level up um and that's a very powerful thing progression is powerful uh it can also be used in very compelling ways for good uh one of the things that we work on at scavenger is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses to sort of something that is very key to the economy and here we have a game you know that people play they go places they do challenges they earn points and we've introduced a progression Dynamic into it where by going to the same place over and over by doing challenges by engaging with the business you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen and you eventually unlock rewards um and this is powerful enough that we can see that it hooks people into these Dynamics pulls them back to the same local businesses creates huge loyalty creates engagement and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses uh these progression Dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world uh the final one I want to talk about and it's a great one to end on is this concept of communal Discovery a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something uh and communal Discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems um this is used in some sort of famous consumer web stories like dig which I'm sure you've all heard of uh dig is a communal Dynamic to try and find and Source the best news the most interesting stories and they made this into a game uh initially they had a leaderboard where if you recommended the best stories you would get points uh and that that really motivated people to find the best stories but it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal a group of people the top seven uh on the leaderboard who would work together to make sure that they maintained that position and they would recommend other people's stories and the game became more powerful than the goal and they actually had to end up shutting down the leaderboard because while it was effective it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership so we have to use this one carefully um it's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly where the game is not the Monopoly game you're playing but these sort of cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk right and now they're just looking for a little sticker that says Boardwalk but it can also be used to find real things uh this is the DARPA balloon challenge where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said use networks try and find these balloons fastest and the winner will get $40,000 and the winner was actually a group out of MIT where they created sort of a pyramid scheme a network where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $2,000 and anyone else to you know push that recommendation up also got a cut of it and in 12 hours they were able to find all these balloons all across the country right really powerful Dynamic and so I've got about you know 20 seconds so if I'm going to leave you with anything uh last decade was the decade of social this next decade is the decade of games we use game Dynamics to build on it we build with mind share we can influence behavior it is very powerful it is very exciting let's all build it together let's do it well and have fun [Applause] playing

I think everything is a game but this is sort of more of a you know what you would think is a game played on a you know board or on a computer screen and then one how this can be used for good so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful so the first one the most famous appointment dynamic in the world is something called happy hour uh so so so uh I just recently dropped out of Princeton and actually ended up uh for the first time in a bar and I saw these happy hour things all over the place right and this is simply an appointment Dynamic come here at a certain time get your drinks half off to win all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time uh this game Dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our Behavior it's influenced our entire culture and that that's that's a really scary thought that one game Dynamic can change things so powerfully um it also exists in more conventional game forms I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now if you haven't I recommend playing it you won't do anything else for the rest of your day uh Farmville has more active users than Twitter uh it's incredibly powerful and it has this Dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops fake crops or they Wilt and this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats when they say your Farms your your crops Wilt after 8 hours or after 6 hours or after 24 hours it changes the life cycle of 70 million some people during the day they will return like clockwork at different times so if they wanted the world to end if they wanted productivity to stop they could make this a 30-minute cycle and no one could do anything else right that that's a little scary but but this can also be used for good um this is a local company called vitality and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time right that's an appointment uh it's it's something that people don't do very well and they have these glow caps which you know Flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine uh this is one that isn't a game yet but really should be you should get points for doing this on time you should lose points for not doing this on time they should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment Dynamic and leverage the games and then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways uh we're going to jump on to the next one maybe yes uh influence and Status so so this is one of the most one of the most famous game Dynamics it's used all over the place uh it's used in your wallets right now right we all want that credit card on the far left because it's black and you see someone at CVS or or not CVS like like Christian Dior or something right and then I don't know I don't have a black card I've got a debit card but they but they they so they they whip it out and and you see man they have that black card I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am and and I and I need that uh and this is used in games as well Modern Warfare one of the most successful selling games of all time I'm only a level four but but I desperately you know want to be a level 10 because they've got that cool Red Badge thing and that means that that I am somehow better uh than everyone else and and that's very powerful to me status is a really good motivator um it's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings School uh and remember I made it through one year so I think I'm I'm qualified to talk on School uh is a game it's just not a terribly well-designed game right there are levels there are C there are B There is a there are statuses I mean what is Valedictorian but a status if we called Val valedictorian a you know White Knight Paladin level 20 uh I think people would probably work a lot harder so so so so school is a game and there' have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly but let's use it consciously like why have games that you can lose why go from an A to an F or a B to a c that sucks why not level up and at Princeton they've actually experiment experimented with this where they have quizzes where you gain experience points and you level up from B to an A and and it's very powerful it can be used in interesting ways uh the third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression Dynamic where you have to sort of make progress you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion um this is used all over the place including LinkedIn where um I I am an unho individual I am only 85% complete on LinkedIn and that bothers me and and and this is this is so deep-seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar we will do it we will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen uh this is used in conventional games as well I mean you see you know this is a paladin level 10 and that's a paladin level 20 and and if you were going to fight you know Orcs on the fields of Mordor against the razal ghoul you'd probably want to be the the bigger one right I would uh and so people work very hard to level up um World of Warcraft is one of the most successful games of all time um the average player spend something like six six and a half hours a day on it they most their most dedicated players it's like a full-time job it's it's insane and they have these systems where you can level up um and that's a very powerful thing progression is powerful uh it can also be used in very compelling ways for good uh one of the things that we work on at scavenger is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses to sort of something that is very key to the economy and here we have a game you know that people play they go places they do challenges they earn points and we've introduced a progression Dynamic into it where by going to the same place over and over by doing challenges by engaging with the business you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen and you eventually unlock rewards um and this is powerful enough that we can see that it hooks people into these Dynamics pulls them back to the same local businesses creates huge loyalty creates engagement and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses uh these progression Dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world uh the final one I want to talk about and it's a great one to end on is this concept of communal Discovery a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something uh and communal Discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems um this is used in some sort of famous consumer web stories like dig which I'm sure you've all heard of uh dig is a communal Dynamic to try and find and Source the best news the most interesting stories and they made this into a game uh initially they had a leaderboard where if you recommended the best stories you would get points uh and that that really motivated people to find the best stories but it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal a group of people the top seven uh on the leaderboard who would work together to make sure that they maintained that position and they would recommend other people's stories and the game became more powerful than the goal and they actually had to end up shutting down the leaderboard because while it was effective it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership so we have to use this one carefully um it's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly where the game is not the Monopoly game you're playing but these sort of cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk right and now they're just looking for a little sticker that says Boardwalk but it can also be used to find real things uh this is the DARPA balloon challenge where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said use networks try and find these balloons fastest and the winner will get $40,000 and the winner was actually a group out of MIT where they created sort of a pyramid scheme a network where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $2,000 and anyone else to you know push that recommendation up also got a cut of it and in 12 hours they were able to find all these balloons all across the country right really powerful Dynamic and so I've got about you know 20 seconds so if I'm going to leave you with anything uh last decade was the decade of social this next decade is the decade of games we use game Dynamics to build on it we build with mind share we can influence behavior it is very powerful it is very exciting let's all build it together let's do it well and have fun [Applause] playing

[Music] [Music] my name is Seth preat I'm the chief ninja of scavenger I I am a proud Princeton Dropout also proud to have relocated here to Boston where I actually grew up uh and yeah Boston easy wins I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here so I'm also I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world uh and this is sort of A New Concept and it's really important because while the last decade was the decade of Social and the decade of where the framework in which we connect with other people was built this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior and the framework in which that is constructed uh is decided upon and that's really important and so I say that I want to build a game on top of the world uh but that's not quite true because uh it's already under construction it's already happening uh and it looks like this right now it looks like the web did back in 1997 right it's not very good uh it's cluttered it's filled with lots of different things that in short aren't that fun uh there are credit card schemes and Airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game Dynamics and actually are building the game layer uh they just suck uh they're not very welld designed right so that's unfortunate um but luckily uh as as as my my favorite Action Hero Bob the Builder says uh we can do better we can build this better and the tools the resources that we use to build a game layer are game Dynamics themselves and so sort of the Crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game Dynamics really interesting things that if you use consciously you can use to influence behavior both for good for bad for in between hopefully for good but this is the sort of the the the important stages in which that framework will get built and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now um just before we jump into that there's sort of a question of why is this important I'm sort of making this claim that there is a gameer on top of the world and that it's very important that we build it properly uh the reason that it's so important is that the last decade what we've seen has been building the social lir has been this framework for connections and construction on that lirer is over uh it's finished there's still a lot to explore there's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this but the framework itself is done and it's called Facebook uh and and that's okay right A lot of people are very happy with Facebook I I like it quite a lot they've created this thing called the open graph and they own all of our connections they own half a billion people and so when you want to build on the social Lair the framework has been decided it is the open graph API and if you're happy with that fantastic if you're not too bad there's nothing you can do but this next decade no and and that that's a real thing I mean we want we want to build Frameworks in a way that that makes it it that makes it acceptable and makes it you know productive down the road so the social layer is all about these connections the game layer is all about influence it's not about adding a social fabric to the web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go it's actually about using Dynamics using forces to influence the behavior of where you are what you do there how you do it that's really really powerful and it's going to be more important in the social air it's going to affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly and so it's incredibly critical that at this moment while it's just getting constructed while the Frameworks like Facebook like the open graph are being created for the game Lair equivalent that we think about it very consciously and that we do it in a way that is open that is available and that can be leveraged for good and so that's what I want to talk about for game Dynamics because construction has just begun and the more consciously we can think about this the better we'll be able to use it for anything that we want so uh like I said the way the way that you go through and build on the game layer is not with uh you know glass and steel and cement and the resources that we use are not this two-dimensional swath of land that we have the resources are mind share and the tools the raw materials are these game Dynamics so with that you know a couple game Dynamics to talk about four um back at scavenger we like to joke that with seven game Dynamics you can get anyone to do anything and so today I'm going to show you four uh because I hope to have a competitive Advantage at the end of this still uh so so the first one uh it's a very simple game Dynamic uh it's called the appointment Dynamic and this is a dynamic in which to succeed players have to do something at a predefined time generally at a predefined place uh and these Dynamics are a little scary sometimes because you think you know other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact what I do where I do it when I do it that that this sort of loss of free will that occurs in games can be frightening so with each Dynamic I'm going to give three examples uh one that shows how this is already being used in the real world so you can sort of rationalize it a little bit one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game I think everything is a game but this is sort of more of a you know what you would think is a game played on a you know board or on a computer screen and then one how this can be used for good so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful so the first one the most famous appointment dynamic in the world is something called happy hour uh so so so uh I just recently dropped out of Princeton and actually ended up uh for the first time in a bar and I saw these happy hour things all over the place right and this is simply an appointment Dynamic come here at a certain time get your drinks half off to win all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time uh this game Dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our Behavior it's influenced our entire culture and that that's that's a really scary thought that one game Dynamic can change things so powerfully um it also exists in more conventional game forms I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now if you haven't I recommend playing it you won't do anything else for the rest of your day uh Farmville has more active users than Twitter uh it's incredibly powerful and it has this Dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops fake crops or they Wilt and this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats when they say your Farms your your crops Wilt after 8 hours or after 6 hours or after 24 hours it changes the life cycle of 70 million some people during the day they will return like clockwork at different times so if they wanted the world to end if they wanted productivity to stop they could make this a 30-minute cycle and no one could do anything else right that that's a little scary but but this can also be used for good um this is a local company called vitality and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time right that's an appointment uh it's it's something that people don't do very well and they have these glow caps which you know Flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine uh this is one that isn't a game yet but really should be you should get points for doing this on time you should lose points for not doing this on time they should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment Dynamic and leverage the games and then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways uh we're going to jump on to the next one maybe yes uh influence and Status so so this is one of the most one of the most famous game Dynamics it's used all over the place uh it's used in your wallets right now right we all want that credit card on the far left because it's black and you see someone at CVS or or not CVS like like Christian Dior or something right and then I don't know I don't have a black card I've got a debit card but they but they they so they they whip it out and and you see man they have that black card I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am and and I and I need that uh and this is used in games as well Modern Warfare one of the most successful selling games of all time I'm only a level four but but I desperately you know want to be a level 10 because they've got that cool Red Badge thing and that means that that I am somehow better uh than everyone else and and that's very powerful to me status is a really good motivator um it's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings School uh and remember I made it through one year so I think I'm I'm qualified to talk on School uh is a game it's just not a terribly well-designed game right there are levels there are C there are B There is a there are statuses I mean what is Valedictorian but a status if we called Val valedictorian a you know White Knight Paladin level 20 uh I think people would probably work a lot harder so so so so school is a game and there' have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly but let's use it consciously like why have games that you can lose why go from an A to an F or a B to a c that sucks why not level up and at Princeton they've actually experiment experimented with this where they have quizzes where you gain experience points and you level up from B to an A and and it's very powerful it can be used in interesting ways uh the third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression Dynamic where you have to sort of make progress you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion um this is used all over the place including LinkedIn where um I I am an unho individual I am only 85% complete on LinkedIn and that bothers me and and and this is this is so deep-seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar we will do it we will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen uh this is

very important that we build it properly uh the reason that it's so important is that the last decade what we've seen has been building the social lir has been this framework for connections and construction on that lirer is over uh it's finished there's still a lot to explore there's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this but the framework itself is done and it's called Facebook uh and and that's okay right A lot of people are very happy with Facebook I I like it quite a lot they've created this thing called the open graph and they own all of our connections they own half a billion people and so when you want to build on the social Lair the framework has been decided it is the open graph API and if you're happy with that fantastic if you're not too bad there's nothing you can do but this next decade no and and that that's a real thing I mean we want we want to build Frameworks in a way that that makes it it that makes it acceptable and makes it you know productive down the road so the social layer is all about these connections the game layer is all about influence it's not about adding a social fabric to the web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go it's actually about using Dynamics using forces to influence the behavior of where you are what you do there how you do it that's really really powerful and it's going to be more important in the social air it's going to affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly and so it's incredibly critical that at this moment while it's just getting constructed while the Frameworks like Facebook like the open graph are being created for the game Lair equivalent that we think about it very consciously and that we do it in a way that is open that is available and that can be leveraged for good and so that's what I want to talk about for game Dynamics because construction has just begun and the more consciously we can think about this the better we'll be able to use it for anything that we want so uh like I said the way the way that you go through and build on the game layer is not with uh you know glass and steel and cement and the resources that we use are not this two-dimensional swath of land that we have the resources are mind share and the tools the raw materials are these game Dynamics so with that you know a couple game Dynamics to talk about four um back at scavenger we like to joke that with seven game Dynamics you can get anyone to do anything and so today I'm going to show you four uh because I hope to have a competitive Advantage at the end of this still uh so so the first one uh it's a very simple game Dynamic uh it's called the appointment Dynamic and this is a dynamic in which to succeed players have to do something at a predefined time generally at a predefined place uh and these Dynamics are a little scary sometimes because you think you know other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact what I do where I do it when I do it that that this sort of loss of free will that occurs in games can be frightening so with each Dynamic I'm going to give three examples uh one that shows how this is already being used in the real world so you can sort of rationalize it a little bit one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game I think everything is a game but this is sort of more of a you know what you would think is a game played on a you know board or on a computer screen and then one how this can be used for good so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful so the first one the most famous appointment dynamic in the world is something called happy hour uh so so so uh I just recently dropped out of Princeton and actually ended up uh for the first time in a bar and I saw these happy hour things all over the place right and this is simply an appointment Dynamic come here at a certain time get your drinks half off to win all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time uh this game Dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our Behavior it's influenced our entire culture and that that's that's a really scary thought that one game Dynamic can change things so powerfully um it also exists in more conventional game forms I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now if you haven't I recommend playing it you won't do anything else for the rest of your day uh Farmville has more active users than Twitter uh it's incredibly powerful and it has this Dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops fake crops or they Wilt and this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats when they say your Farms your your crops Wilt after 8 hours or after 6 hours or after 24 hours it changes the life cycle of 70 million some people during the day they will return like clockwork at different times so if they wanted the world to end if they wanted productivity to stop they could make this a 30-minute cycle and no one could do anything else right that that's a little scary but but this can also be used for good um this is a local company called vitality and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time right that's an appointment uh it's it's something that people don't do very well and they have these glow caps which you know Flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine uh this is one that isn't a game yet but really should be you should get points for doing this on time you should lose points for not doing this on time they should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment Dynamic and leverage the games and then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways uh we're going to jump on to the next one maybe yes uh influence and Status so so this is one of the most one of the most famous game Dynamics it's used all over the place uh it's used in your wallets right now right we all want that credit card on the far left because it's black and you see someone at CVS or or not CVS like like Christian Dior or something right and then I don't know I don't have a black card I've got a debit card but they but they they so they they whip it out and and you see man they have that black card I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am and and I and I need that uh and this is used in games as well Modern Warfare one of the most successful selling games of all time I'm only a level four but but I desperately you know want to be a level 10 because they've got that cool Red Badge thing and that means that that I am somehow better uh than everyone else and and that's very powerful to me status is a really good motivator um it's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings School uh and remember I made it through one year so I think I'm I'm qualified to talk on School uh is a game it's just not a terribly well-designed game right there are levels there are C there are B There is a there are statuses I mean what is Valedictorian but a status if we called Val valedictorian a you know White Knight Paladin level 20 uh I think people would probably work a lot harder so so so so school is a game and there' have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly but let's use it consciously like why have games that you can lose why go from an A to an F or a B to a c that sucks why not level up and at Princeton they've actually experiment experimented with this where they have quizzes where you gain experience points and you level up from B to an A and and it's very powerful it can be used in interesting ways uh the third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression Dynamic where you have to sort of make progress you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion um this is used all over the place including LinkedIn where um I I am an unho individual I am only 85% complete on LinkedIn and that bothers me and and and this is this is so deep-seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar we will do it we will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen uh this is used in conventional games as well I mean you see you know this is a paladin level 10 and that's a paladin level 20 and and if you were going to fight you know Orcs on the fields of Mordor against the razal ghoul you'd probably want to be the the bigger one right I would uh and so people work very hard to level up um World of Warcraft is one of the most successful games of all time um the average player spend something like six six and a half hours a day on it they most their most dedicated players it's like a full-time job it's it's insane and they have these systems where you can level up um and that's a very powerful thing progression is powerful uh it can also be used in very compelling ways for good uh one of the things that we work on at scavenger is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses to sort of something that is very key to the economy and here we have a game you know that people play they go places they do challenges they earn points and we've introduced a progression Dynamic into it where by going to the same place over and over by doing challenges by engaging with the business you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen and you eventually unlock rewards um and this is powerful enough that we can see that it hooks people into these Dynamics pulls them back to the same local businesses creates huge loyalty creates engagement and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses uh these progression Dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world uh the final one I want to talk about and it's a great one to end on is this concept of communal Discovery a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something uh and communal Discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems um this is used in some sort of famous consumer web stories like dig which I'm sure you've all heard of uh dig is a communal Dynamic to try and find and Source the best news the most interesting stories and they made this into a game uh initially they had a leaderboard where if you recommended the best stories you would get points uh and that that really motivated people to find the best stories but it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal a group of people the top seven uh on the leaderboard who would work together to make sure that they maintained that position and they would recommend other people's stories and the game became more powerful than the goal and they actually had to end up shutting down the leaderboard because while it was effective it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership so we have to use this one carefully um it's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly where the game is not the Monopoly game you're playing but these sort of cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk right and now they're just looking for a little sticker that says Boardwalk but it can also be used to find real things uh this is the DARPA balloon challenge where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said use networks try and find these balloons fastest and the winner will get $40,000 and the winner was actually a group out of MIT where they created sort of a pyramid scheme a network where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $2,000 and anyone else to you know push that recommendation up also got a cut of it and in 12 hours they were able to find all these balloons all across the country right really powerful Dynamic and so I've got about you know 20 seconds so if I'm going to leave you with anything uh last decade was the decade of social this next decade is the decade of games we use game Dynamics to build on it we build with mind share we can influence behavior it is very powerful it is very exciting let's all build it together let's do it well and have fun [Applause] playing

[Music] [Music] my name is Seth preat I'm the chief ninja of scavenger I I am a proud Princeton Dropout also proud to have relocated here to Boston where I actually grew up uh and yeah Boston easy wins I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here so I'm also I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world uh and this is sort of A New Concept and it's really important because while the last decade was the decade of Social and the decade of where the framework in which we connect with other people was built this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior and the framework in which that is constructed uh is decided upon and that's really important and so I say that I want to build a game on top of the world uh but that's not quite true because uh it's already under construction it's already happening uh and it looks like this right now it looks like the web did back in 1997 right it's not very good uh it's cluttered it's filled with lots of different things that in short aren't that fun uh there are credit card schemes and Airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game Dynamics and actually are building the game layer uh they just suck uh they're not very welld designed right so that's unfortunate um but luckily uh as as as my my favorite Action Hero Bob the Builder says uh we can do better we can build this better and the tools the resources that we use to build a game layer are game Dynamics themselves and so sort of the Crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game Dynamics really interesting things that if you use consciously you can use to influence behavior both for good for bad for in between hopefully for good but this is the sort of the the the important stages in which that framework will get built and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now um just before we jump into that there's sort of a question of why is this important I'm sort of making this claim that there is a gameer on top of the world and that it's very important that we build it properly uh the reason that it's so important is that the last decade what we've seen has been building the social lir has been this framework for connections and construction on that lirer is over uh it's finished there's still a lot to explore there's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this but the framework itself is done and it's called Facebook uh and and that's okay right A lot of people are very happy with Facebook I I like it quite a lot they've created this thing called the open graph and they own all of our connections they own half a billion people and so when you want to build on the social Lair the framework has been decided it is the open graph API and if you're happy with that fantastic if you're not too bad there's nothing you can do but this next decade no and and that that's a real thing I mean we want we want to build Frameworks in a way that that makes it it that makes it acceptable and makes it you know productive down the road so the social layer is all about these connections the game layer is all about influence it's not about adding a social fabric to the web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go it's actually about using Dynamics using forces to influence the behavior of where you are what you do there how

you know Flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine uh this is one that isn't a game yet but really should be you should get points for doing this on time you should lose points for not doing this on time they should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment Dynamic and leverage the games and then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways uh we're going to jump on to the next one maybe yes uh influence and Status so so this is one of the most one of the most famous game Dynamics it's used all over the place uh it's used in your wallets right now right we all want that credit card on the far left because it's black and you see someone at CVS or or not CVS like like Christian Dior or something right and then I

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6 is not the most similar, instead Question 4's option is not a match, but Question 9's option is not a match, however, none of the generated questions ask for a definition of a gaming dynamic.**

However, I did find a question that somewhat aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ:

**Question 6: Which game dynamic is most relevant to a marketing campaign that aims to increase customer loyalty, according to Seth Priebatsch? Options: A. Appointment Dynamic, B. Influence and Status, C. Progression Dynamic, D. Communal Discovery**

This question does not ask for the definition of "communal discovery," but it does mention it as an option. 

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the questions are a perfect match. However, I can suggest a possible similar question:

**Generated Question is not available, however, it would look something like this:**

for my home theater a home theater write of our DVDs video-on-demand and for a lot of television for me Law & Order SVU Tina Fey and 30 rock and Judge Judy the people are real the cases are real the rulings are final now I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions especially my passion for Judge Judy and you fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us but I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life a passion for the live professional performing arts performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire yes but jazz as well modern dance opera theatre and more and more and more you know frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems we now realize that the Internet is if anything too effective in that regard depending on who you read an arts organization or an artist who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer now competes with between three and five thousand different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day we now know in fact that technology's our biggest competitor for leisure time five years ago Gen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV the majority on TV Gen Y are spent even more twenty three point eight hours the majority online and now a typical in a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent twenty thousand hours online and an additional ten thousand hours playing video games a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined moreover we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep we can shop at 3:00 in the morning or 8:00 at night ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body types ex expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts which have set curtain times set venues attended inconveniences of travel parking and the like simply cannot meet and we're all acutely aware what's it gonna mean in the future when we asked someone to pay $100 for a symphony opera or ballet ticket when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the Internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free these are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain but as particular as they feel to us we know we're not alone all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and communications a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry the magazine industry the book and publishing industry and more saddled in the Performing Arts as we are by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction in streaming locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues where we charge exorbitant prices many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves are we next everyone I talked to in performing arts resonates to the world of aid words of Adrian rich who in dreams of a common language wrote we are out in a country that has no language no laws whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they gave us are out-of-date by years and for those of you who love the arts aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day now rather than saying that we're a bit brink of our own annihilation I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental Reformation a Reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century the arts Reformation like the religious Reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed the printing press really leading the charge on the religious and Reformation both Reformation czar predicated on fractious discussion internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models and at heart both Reformation I think we're asking the questions who's entitled to practice how are they entitled to practice and indeed do we need anyone to inter mediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine Chris Anderson someone I trust you all know editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and author of the long tale really was the first for me to nail a lot of this he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet web cell a web technology minicams and more the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history in the 1930s if any of you wanted to make a movie you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more and now who in this room doesn't know a 14-year old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the 30s Warner Brothers RKO did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market a time when anyone is a potential author frankly what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations this group others have called the pro Am's amateur artists doing work at a professional level you see them on YouTube and dance competitions film festivals and more they are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions ultimately we now live in a world defined not by consumption but by participation but I want to be clear just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal church or to the priesthood I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community as by far too short-sighted and indeed while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional the single most exciting development in the last five to ten years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women's rights or human rights around global warming issues or AIDS relief or more not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada but by Liz Lerman's dance exchange a multi-generational professional dance company whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN today's professional theater community is defined not only by the Shah and Stratford festivals but by the cornerstone Theatre of Los Angeles a collective of artists that after nine Levin brought together ten different religious communities the Baha'i the Catholic the Muslim the Jewish even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross community healing today's performers like we're deaf salons work in women's prisons helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs do you find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more and indeed I think rather than being annihilated the Performing Arts are poised on the brink of a time where we will be more important than we have ever been you know we've said for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy dollars spent in restaurants from parking at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes the piano tuner who chooses the instruments and more but the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward especially in industries we can't even imagine yet just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries which few if any of us could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence the ability to listen deeply to have empathy to articulate change to motivate others the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter especially now as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the Arts to shape our individual and national characters and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience ultimately especially now in this world where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws in reality-tv that thrives on humiliation and in its context of announcements where the thing we hear most repeatedly day-in day-out in the United States in every train station every bus station every plane station is ladies and gentlemen please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion the arts whatever they do whenever they call us together invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity god knows if we have ever needed that capacity in human history we need it now you know we're bound together not I think by Technology Entertainment Design but by common cause we work to promote healthy vibrant societies to ameliorate human suffering to promote a more thoughtful subjective empathic World Order I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work whatever your purpose may be I promise you

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of hours a typical entering college student has spent online. While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 5 mentions the speaker's experience as a cultural omnivore and their understanding of audiences, which is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I noticed that the transcript mentions the following sentence: "a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent twenty thousand hours online and an additional ten thousand hours playing video games."

Considering this information, I would suggest that the closest match is not available among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, but it's not a good match.

If I were to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest the following:

Question: According to the speaker, how many hours will a typical entering college student have spent online?
Options: A. 10,000 hours, B. 5,000 hours, C. 100,000 hours, D. 20,000 hours

**Transcript**:
I am a cultural omnivore one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod an iPod that contains vogner and Mozart pop diva Christina Aguilera country singer Josh Turner got gangster rap artist Kirk Franklin concerto symphonies and more and more I'm a voracious reader a reader who do deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephenie Meyer I have read the Twilight tetralogy and one who lives for my home theater a home theater write of our DVDs video-on-demand and for a lot of television for me Law & Order SVU Tina Fey and 30 rock and Judge Judy the people are real the cases are real the rulings are final now I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions especially my passion for Judge Judy and you fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us but I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life a passion for the live professional performing arts performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire yes but jazz as well modern dance opera theatre and more and more and more you know frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems we now realize that the Internet is if anything too effective in that regard depending on who you read an arts organization or an artist who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer now competes with between three and five thousand different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day we now know in fact that technology's our biggest competitor for leisure time five years ago Gen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV the majority on TV Gen Y are spent even more twenty three point eight hours the majority online and now a typical in a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent twenty thousand hours online and an additional ten thousand hours playing video games a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined moreover we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep we can shop at 3:00 in the morning or 8:00 at night ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body types ex expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts which have set curtain times set venues attended inconveniences of travel parking and the like simply cannot meet and we're all acutely aware what's it gonna mean in the future when we asked someone to pay $100 for a symphony opera or ballet ticket when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the Internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free these are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain but as particular as they feel to us we know we're not alone all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and communications a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry the magazine industry the book and publishing industry and more saddled in the Performing Arts as we are by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction in streaming locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues where we charge exorbitant prices many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves are we next everyone I talked to in performing arts resonates to the world of aid words of Adrian rich who in dreams of a common language wrote we are out in a country that has no language no laws whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they gave us are out-of-date by years and for those of you who love the arts aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day now rather than saying that we're a bit brink of our own annihilation I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental Reformation a Reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century the arts Reformation like the religious Reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed the printing press really leading the charge on the religious and Reformation both Reformation czar predicated on fractious discussion internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models and at heart both Reformation I think we're asking the questions who's entitled to practice how are they entitled to practice and indeed do we need anyone to inter mediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine Chris Anderson someone I trust you all know editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and author of the long tale really was the first for me to nail a lot of this he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet web cell a web technology minicams and more the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history in the 1930s if any of you wanted to make a movie you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more and now who in this room doesn't know a 14-year old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the 30s Warner Brothers RKO did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market a time when anyone is a potential author frankly what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations this group others have called the pro Am's amateur artists doing work at a professional level you see them on YouTube and dance competitions film festivals and more they are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions ultimately we now live in a world defined not by consumption but by participation but I want to be clear just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal church or to the priesthood I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community as by far too short-sighted and indeed while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional the single most exciting development in the last five to ten years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women's rights or human rights around global warming issues or AIDS relief or more not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada but by Liz Lerman's dance exchange a multi-generational professional dance company whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN today's professional theater community is defined not only by the Shah and Stratford festivals but by the cornerstone Theatre of Los Angeles a collective of artists that after nine Levin brought together ten different religious communities the Baha'i the Catholic the Muslim the Jewish even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross community healing today's performers like we're deaf salons work in women's prisons helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs do you find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more and indeed I think rather than being annihilated the Performing Arts are poised on the brink of a time where we will be more important than we have ever been you know we've said for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy dollars spent in restaurants from parking at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes the piano tuner who chooses the instruments and more but the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward especially in industries we can't even imagine yet just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries which few if any of us could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence the ability to listen deeply to have empathy to articulate change to motivate others the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter especially now as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the Arts to shape our individual and national characters and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience ultimately especially now in this world where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws in reality-tv that thrives on humiliation and in its context of announcements where the thing we hear most repeatedly day-in day-out in the United States in every train station every bus station every plane station is ladies and gentlemen please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion the arts whatever they do whenever they call us together invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity god knows if we have ever needed that capacity in human history we need it now you know we're bound together not I think by Technology Entertainment Design but by common cause we work to promote healthy vibrant societies to ameliorate human suffering to promote a more thoughtful subjective empathic World Order I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work whatever your purpose may be I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come and I thank you for your kindness and your patience and listening to me this afternoon thank you and Godspeed

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the "single most exciting development in the artistic world in the last five to 10 years" as stated in the ground truth MCQ. But, I can infer that the correct answer "The rise of the professional hybrid artist" is related to the democratization of artistic production and distribution, which is mentioned in Question 6.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it's Question 6, but with a note that it's not an exact match.

discussion internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models and at heart both Reformation I think we're asking the questions who's entitled to practice how are they entitled to practice and indeed do we need anyone to inter mediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine Chris Anderson someone I trust you all know editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and author of the long tale really was the first for me to nail a lot of this he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet web cell a web technology minicams and more the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history in the 1930s if any of you wanted to make a movie you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more and now who in this room doesn't know a 14-year old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the 30s Warner Brothers RKO did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market a time when anyone is a potential author frankly what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations this group others have called the pro Am's amateur artists doing work at a professional level you see them on YouTube and dance competitions film festivals and more they are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions ultimately we now live in a world defined not by consumption but by participation but I want to be clear just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal church or to the priesthood I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community as by far too short-sighted and indeed while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional the single most exciting development in the last five to ten years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women's rights or human rights around global warming issues or AIDS relief or more not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada but by Liz Lerman's dance exchange a multi-generational professional dance company whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN today's professional theater community is defined not only by the Shah and Stratford festivals but by the cornerstone Theatre of Los Angeles a collective of artists that after nine Levin brought together ten different religious communities the Baha'i the Catholic the Muslim the Jewish even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross community healing today's performers like we're deaf salons work in women's prisons helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs do you find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more and indeed I think rather than being annihilated the Performing Arts are poised on the brink of a time where we will be more important than we have ever been you know we've said for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy dollars spent in restaurants from parking at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes the piano tuner who chooses the instruments and more but the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward especially in industries we can't even imagine yet just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries which few if any of us could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence the ability to listen deeply to have empathy to articulate change to motivate others the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter especially now as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the Arts to shape our individual and national characters and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience ultimately especially now in this world where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws in reality-tv that thrives on humiliation and in its context of announcements where the thing we hear most repeatedly day-in day-out in the United States in every train station every bus station every plane station is ladies and gentlemen please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion the arts whatever they do whenever they call us together invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity god knows if we have ever needed that capacity in human history we need it now you know we're bound together not I think by Technology Entertainment Design but by common cause we work to promote healthy vibrant societies to ameliorate human suffering to promote a more thoughtful subjective empathic World Order I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work whatever your purpose may be I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come and I thank you for your kindness and your patience and listening to me this afternoon thank you and Godspeed

**Transcript**:
Do you have a friend or a sibling that's always competing with you to see who's the fastest? Our alien friends Bleebop and Mark are having the same debate with their custom-built rockets, and they've asked us to be the judge of a space race to their moon. The only problem is that they are starting from different asteroids. Bleebop is on an asteroid 240 miles from the moon, and Mark is on one 150 miles away. Don't worry, it's not rocket science. Solving this equation is as simple as DIRT. We can decide who the winner is using the D=RT formula, or DIRT. This stands for distance equals rate times time. In the case of Bleebop and Mark, we will only know the distance they traveled and the time it took for them to get to the finish line. It'll be up to us to find the rate and who is faster. Let's turn to the race now and see what information we get. Three, two, one, blast off! Bleebop and Mark's rockets go zipping across the galaxy towards their moon, dodging clunky meteorites and loopy space buggies. After a few close calls with a wandering satellite, Mark arrives first in two hours, and Bleebop gets there one hour later. Looks like Mark has the faster rocket, but let's check out the results with our DIRT equation. Begin by setting up a chart. Make four columns and three rows. Use DIRT to remember what to fill in. Each rocket will have information for distance, rate, and time. Mark's rocket went 150 miles, we don't know the rate, and he got there in 2 hours. Bleebop's rocket went 240 miles, we don't know the rate, and the time is 1 hour after Mark, or 3 hours. Because we don't know Mark or Bleebop's rate, that number is going to be a variable in each equation, which we'll represent with x. We'll solve the equation for the variable to find its value. Mark finished first, so start with his rocket. Remembering DIRT, write down D=RT. 150 miles equals x times 2 hours. Divide both sides by 2 hours. This will leave x isolated on the right side of the equation. 150 miles divided by 2 hours is 75 miles over 1 hour. Mark's rate is 75 miles per hour. That's what mph means. It's the amount of miles over one hour. Still think Mark is faster? Let's set up the same equation for Bleebop and see. D=RT 240 miles equals x times 3 hours. Divide both sides by 3 hours. This will leave x isolated on the right side of the equation. 240 miles divided by 3 hours is 80 miles over 1 hour. Bleebop's rate is 80 miles per hour. Wow, even though Bleebop got there one hour later, it turns out he had the faster rocket. Mark seems pretty upset, but with aliens, you can never really tell. Thanks to DIRT, you now know how to calculate distance, rate, and time. In what other situations can you use the distance formula? You don't even need to be watching a space race. As long as you know two pieces of information for the formula D=RT, you can calculate any moving vehicle or object. Now, the next time you're in a car, you can let your friends know exactly when you'll be arriving, how fast you're going, or the distance you'll travel. It's as simple as DIRT.

**Transcript**:
If you live on the east coast
of the United States, you've spent the last
17 years of your life walking, eating and sleeping above a dormant army of insects. These are the cicadas. Every 17 years, billions of them emerge
from the ground to do three things: molt, mate and die. There are 15 different broods
of cicadas out there, grouped by when they'll emerge
from the ground. Some of these broods
are on a 13-year cycle, others are on a 17-year clock. Either way, the cicadas live underground
for most of their lives, feeding on the juices of plant roots. When it's time to emerge, the adults begin to burrow
their way out of the ground and up to the surface, where they'll live for just a few weeks. During these weeks, though, everybody will know
the cicadas have arrived. There will be billions of them. And they're loud. Male cicadas band together
to call for female mates, and their collective chorus
can reach up to 100 decibels -- as loud as a chain saw. In fact, if you happen to be using
a chain saw or a lawn mower, male cicadas will flock to you, thinking that you're one of them. Now, like most things in nature, the cicadas don't arrive without a posse. There are all sort of awesome
and gross predators and parasites that come along with the buzzing bugs. Take the fungus Massospora for example. This little white fungus buries itself
in the cicada's abdomen and eats the bug alive, leaving behind its spores. When those spores rupture, they burst out of the still-alive cicada, turning the bug into a flying
saltshaker of death, raining spores down upon
its unsuspecting cicada neighbors. But while we know pretty precisely when the cicadas will arrive
and fade away, we're still not totally certain of why. There are certain advantages to having your entire species
emerge at once, of course. The sheer number of cicadas
coming out of the ground is so overwhelming to predators,
it is essentially guaranteed that a few bugs will survive
and reproduce. And since cicadas emerge
every 13 or 17 years, longer than the lifespan
of many of their predators, the animals that eat them don't learn
to depend on their availability. But why 13 and 17 years, instead of 16 or 18 or 12? Well, that part no one really knows. It's possible the number
just happened by chance, or, perhaps, cicadas
really love prime numbers. Eventually, the cicadas
will mate and slowly die off, their call fading into the distance. The eggs they lay
will begin the cycle again, their cicada babies burrowing
into the earth, feeding on plant juice, and waiting for their turn
to darken the skies and fill the air with their songs. In 17 years, they'll be ready. Will you?

**Transcript**:
If you live on the east coast
of the United States, you've spent the last
17 years of your life walking, eating and sleeping above a dormant army of insects. These are the cicadas. Every 17 years, billions of them emerge
from the ground to do three things: molt, mate and die. There are 15 different broods
of cicadas out there, grouped by when they'll emerge
from the ground. Some of these broods
are on a 13-year cycle, others are on a 17-year clock. Either way, the cicadas live underground
for most of their lives, feeding on the juices of plant roots. When it's time to emerge, the adults begin to burrow
their way out of the ground and up to the surface, where they'll live for just a few weeks. During these weeks, though, everybody will know
the cicadas have arrived. There will be billions of them. And they're loud. Male cicadas band together
to call for female mates, and their collective chorus
can reach up to 100 decibels -- as loud as a chain saw. In fact, if you happen to be using
a chain saw or a lawn mower, male cicadas will flock to you, thinking that you're one of them. Now, like most things in nature, the cicadas don't arrive without a posse. There are all sort of awesome
and gross predators and parasites that come along with the buzzing bugs. Take the fungus Massospora for example. This little white fungus buries itself
in the cicada's abdomen and eats the bug alive, leaving behind its spores. When those spores rupture, they burst out of the still-alive cicada, turning the bug into a flying
saltshaker of death, raining spores down upon
its unsuspecting cicada neighbors. But while we know pretty precisely when the cicadas will arrive
and fade away, we're still not totally certain of why. There are certain advantages to having your entire species
emerge at once, of course. The sheer number of cicadas
coming out of the ground is so overwhelming to predators,
it is essentially guaranteed that a few bugs will survive
and reproduce. And since cicadas emerge
every 13 or 17 years, longer than the lifespan
of many of their predators, the animals that eat them don't learn
to depend on their availability. But why 13 and 17 years, instead of 16 or 18 or 12? Well, that part no one really knows. It's possible the number
just happened by chance, or, perhaps, cicadas
really love prime numbers. Eventually, the cicadas
will mate and slowly die off, their call fading into the distance. The eggs they lay
will begin the cycle again, their cicada babies burrowing
into the earth, feeding on plant juice, and waiting for their turn
to darken the skies and fill the air with their songs. In 17 years, they'll be ready. Will you?

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of cicadas and sound.

The most similar generated MCQ is not available. However, if I had to choose one, I would say Question 3 is the closest in terms of discussing a characteristic of cicadas, but it does not address the loudness of cicadas.

If I had to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

Question: How loud can a group of male cicadas calling for mates get?
Options: A. As loud as a cricket, B. As loud as a chainsaw, C. As loud as a spaceship taking off, D. They don’t make any noise
Correct Option: B

However, since this new question is not among the generated MCQs, I must conclude that there is no matching generated MCQ.

If I really had to choose an index, I would say "None" or "Not Available" is the most accurate response.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What is the relationship between the fungus Massospora and cicadas? Options: A. Symbiotic, B. Mutualistic, C. Parasitic, D. Commensal Correct Option: C.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only mentions the fungus and not other potential predators. A more accurate match would be a question that includes all the options mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (birds, small mammals, fungus). Unfortunately, such a question is not present in the provided generated MCQs.

Among the available options, Question 7 is the closest match, but it's essential to note that it does not fully capture the intent and scope of the ground truth MCQ.

How's this for a strange idea: a day off from work in honor of work itself? Actually, that is what Labor Day, celebrated in the United States and Canada on the first Monday of every September, is all about. The first American Labor Day was celebrated in New York City on September 5th, 1882, as thousands of workers and their families came to Union Square for a day in the park. It was not a national holiday but had been organized by a union to honor workers and their hard efforts with a rare day of rest, halfway between July 4th and Thanksgiving. There were picnics and a parade, but there were also protests. The workers had gathered, not just to rest and celebrate, but to demand fair wages, the end of child labor, and the right to organize into unions. During the period known as The Industrial Revolution, many jobs were difficult, dirty and dangerous. People worked for twelve hours, six days a week, without fringe benefits, such as vacations, health care and pensions, and if you were young, chances are you were doing manual labor instead of your ABCs and fractions. Children as young as ten worked in some of the most hazardous places, like coal mines or factories filled with boiling vats or dangerous machines. Trying to win better pay, shorter hours and safer conditions workers had begun to form labor unions in America and Canada, but the companies they worked for often fought hard to keep unions out and to supress strikes. At times, this led to violent battles between workers and business owners with the owners often backed up by the police, or even the military. In the following years, the idea of Labor Day caught on in America with official celebrations reaching 30 states. But then came the violent Haymarket Square Riot of 1886, which led to the deaths of several policemen and workers in Chicago and the execution of four union leaders. After that, many labor and political groups around the world had begun to mark Haymarket Square on May 1st, which became known as International Workers' Day. In 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed the law making Labor Day a federal holiday in America, only days after he had sent 12,000 soldiers to end a violent railroad strike that resulted in the death of several people. The original September date was kept, partly to avoid the more radical associations of May 1st. Canada also created its Labor Day in 1894. But, in spite of this new holiday, it would be a long time before the changes that workers wanted became a reality. In 1938, during the Great Depression that left millions without jobs, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a law calling for an eight-hour work day, a five-day work week, and an end to child labor, some of the first federal protections for American workers. As America and Canada celebrate Labor Day, most of the two countries' children enjoy a day off from school. But it is important to remember that there was a time that everyday was a labor day for children in America and Canada, and unfortunately, the same fact remains true for millions of children around the world today.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarity in terms of content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the city where the first American Labor Day was celebrated. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 3 does ask about the primary reason for organizing the first Labor Day in 1882, which is related to the same event.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in terms of content, I would suggest Question 1, which asks about the date when Labor Day is celebrated in the United States and Canada. This question is related to Labor Day celebrations, but it does not ask about the city where the first Labor Day was celebrated.

If I really had to choose, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, but please note that it's not a direct match.

How's this for a strange idea: a day off from work in honor of work itself? Actually, that is what Labor Day, celebrated in the United States and Canada on the first Monday of every September, is all about. The first American Labor Day was celebrated in New York City on September 5th, 1882, as thousands of workers and their families came to Union Square for a day in the park. It was not a national holiday but had been organized by a union to honor workers and their hard efforts with a rare day of rest, halfway between July 4th and Thanksgiving. There were picnics and a parade, but there were also protests. The workers had gathered, not just to rest and celebrate, but to demand fair wages, the end of child labor, and the right to organize into unions. During the period known as The Industrial Revolution, many jobs were difficult, dirty and dangerous. People worked for twelve hours, six days a week, without fringe benefits, such as vacations, health care and pensions, and if you were young, chances are you were doing manual labor instead of your ABCs and fractions. Children as young as ten worked in some of the most hazardous places, like coal mines or factories filled with boiling vats or dangerous machines. Trying to win better pay, shorter hours and safer conditions workers had begun to form labor unions in America and Canada, but the companies they worked for often fought hard to keep unions out and to supress strikes. At times, this led to violent battles between workers and business owners with the owners often backed up by the police, or even the military. In the following years, the idea of Labor Day caught on in America with official celebrations reaching 30 states. But then came the violent Haymarket Square Riot of 1886, which led to the deaths of several policemen and workers in Chicago and the execution of four union leaders. After that, many labor and political groups around the world had begun to mark Haymarket Square on May 1st, which became known as International Workers' Day. In 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed the law making Labor Day a federal holiday in America, only days after he had sent 12,000 soldiers to end a violent railroad strike that resulted in the death of several people. The original September date was kept, partly to avoid the more radical associations of May 1st. Canada also created its Labor Day in 1894. But, in spite of this new holiday, it would be a long time before the changes that workers wanted became a reality. In 1938, during the Great Depression that left millions without jobs, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a law calling for an eight-hour work day, a five-day work week, and an end to child labor, some of the first federal protections for American workers. As America and Canada celebrate Labor Day, most of the two countries' children enjoy a day off from school. But it is important to remember that there was a time that everyday was a labor day for children in America and Canada, and unfortunately, the same fact remains true for millions of children around the world today.

How old is the Earth? Well, by counting the number of isotopes in a sample of rock that's undergone radioactive decay, geologists have estimated the Earth's birthday, when it first formed from a solar nebula, to be 4.6 billion years ago. But just how long is that really? Here's some analogies that might help you understand. For example, let's imagine the entire history of Earth until the present day as a single calendar year. On January 1st, the Earth begins to form. By March 3rd, there's the first evidence of single-celled bacteria. Life remains amazingly unicellular until November 11th when the first multicellular organisms, known as the Ediacaran fauna, come along. Shortly thereafter, on November 16th at 6:08 p.m. is the Cambrian Explosion of life, a major milestone, when all of the modern phyla started to appear. On December 10th at 1:26 p.m., the dinosaurs first evolve but are wiped out by an asteroid just two weeks later. On December 31st, the mighty Roman empire rises and falls in just under four seconds. And Columbus sets sail for what he thinks is India at three seconds to midnight. If you try to write the history of the Earth using just one page per year, your book would be 145 miles thick, more than half the distance to the international space station. The story of the 3.2 million year-old Australopithecine fossil known as Lucy would be found on the 144th mile, just over 500 feet from the end of the book. The United States of America's Declaration of Independence would be signed in the last half-inch. Or if we compared geologic time to a woman stretching her arms to a span of six feet, the simple act of filing her nails would wipe away all of recorded human history. Finally, let's imagine the history of the Earth as your life: from the moment you're born to your first day of high school. Your first word, first time sitting up, and first time walking would all take place while life on Earth was comprised of single-celled organisms. In fact, the first multicellular organism wouldn't evolve until you were 12 years old and starting 7th grade, right around the time your science teacher is telling the class how fossils are formed. The dinosaurs don't appear until three months into 8th grade and are soon wiped out right around spring break. Three days before 9th grade begins, when you realize summer is over and you need new school supplies, Lucy, the Australopithecine, is walking around Africa. As you finish breakfast and head outside to catch your bus 44 minutes before school, the Neanderthals are going extinct throughout Europe. The most recent glacial period ends as your bus drops you off 16 minutes before class. Columbus sets sail 50 seconds before class as you're still trying to find the right classroom. The Declaration of Independence is signed 28 seconds later as you look for an empty seat. And you were born 1.3 seconds before the bell rings. So, you see, the Earth is extremely, unbelievably old compared to us humans with a fossil record hiding incredible stories to tell us about the past and possibly the future as well. But in the short time we've been here, we've learned so much and will surely learn more over the next decades and centuries, near moments in geological time.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although Question 8 does not directly ask about the dinosaurs' extinction, it does address the relationship between the Earth's age and the relatively short period of human existence, which is also the main idea behind the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ aims to put the dinosaurs' extinction into perspective within the Earth's entire history, emphasizing that it occurred relatively recently. Similarly, Question 8 highlights the brevity of human existence compared to the Earth's age, which aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the closest one, I would choose Question 8, but I would recommend creating a new question that more directly addresses the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
How old is the Earth? Well, by counting the number of isotopes in a sample of rock that's undergone radioactive decay, geologists have estimated the Earth's birthday, when it first formed from a solar nebula, to be 4.6 billion years ago. But just how long is that really? Here's some analogies that might help you understand. For example, let's imagine the entire history of Earth until the present day as a single calendar year. On January 1st, the Earth begins to form. By March 3rd, there's the first evidence of single-celled bacteria. Life remains amazingly unicellular until November 11th when the first multicellular organisms, known as the Ediacaran fauna, come along. Shortly thereafter, on November 16th at 6:08 p.m. is the Cambrian Explosion of life, a major milestone, when all of the modern phyla started to appear. On December 10th at 1:26 p.m., the dinosaurs first evolve but are wiped out by an asteroid just two weeks later. On December 31st, the mighty Roman empire rises and falls in just under four seconds. And Columbus sets sail for what he thinks is India at three seconds to midnight. If you try to write the history of the Earth using just one page per year, your book would be 145 miles thick, more than half the distance to the international space station. The story of the 3.2 million year-old Australopithecine fossil known as Lucy would be found on the 144th mile, just over 500 feet from the end of the book. The United States of America's Declaration of Independence would be signed in the last half-inch. Or if we compared geologic time to a woman stretching her arms to a span of six feet, the simple act of filing her nails would wipe away all of recorded human history. Finally, let's imagine the history of the Earth as your life: from the moment you're born to your first day of high school. Your first word, first time sitting up, and first time walking would all take place while life on Earth was comprised of single-celled organisms. In fact, the first multicellular organism wouldn't evolve until you were 12 years old and starting 7th grade, right around the time your science teacher is telling the class how fossils are formed. The dinosaurs don't appear until three months into 8th grade and are soon wiped out right around spring break. Three days before 9th grade begins, when you realize summer is over and you need new school supplies, Lucy, the Australopithecine, is walking around Africa. As you finish breakfast and head outside to catch your bus 44 minutes before school, the Neanderthals are going extinct throughout Europe. The most recent glacial period ends as your bus drops you off 16 minutes before class. Columbus sets sail 50 seconds before class as you're still trying to find the right classroom. The Declaration of Independence is signed 28 seconds later as you look for an empty seat. And you were born 1.3 seconds before the bell rings. So, you see, the Earth is extremely, unbelievably old compared to us humans with a fossil record hiding incredible stories to tell us about the past and possibly the future as well. But in the short time we've been here, we've learned so much and will surely learn more over the next decades and centuries, near moments in geological time.

By understanding how life has evolved over time and using the fossil record to learn about past environments and ecosystems, D. By calculating the exact age of the Earth Correct Option: C**

However, this question doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that encompasses understanding the evolution of organisms over time, the possibility for life on other planets, humans' impact on the environment, and the process of evolution.

Since none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that best aligns with the intent and content.

**Question 11: What is the significance of the Earth's age and its relevance to human existence? Options: A. The Earth's age has no relevance to human existence, B. The Earth's age is only relevant to understanding the history of the Roman Empire, C. The Earth's age is relevant to understanding the history of life on Earth and our place in the universe, D. The Earth's age is only relevant to calculating the exact age of the Earth Correct Option: C**

This question is still not a perfect match but is the closest in terms of understanding the significance of geologic time and its relevance to human existence, the evolution of life on Earth, and our place in the universe.

However, I must note that **Question 5: How can the concept of geologic time be used to understand the history of life on Earth? Options: A. By studying the fossil record of only the past 100 years, B. By comparing the Earth's history to a calendar year or a person's life, C. By understanding how life has evolved over time, D. By calculating the exact age of the Earth Correct Option: C** is also a strong candidate as it directly addresses understanding the evolution of life over time.

Considering all the options, I would choose **Question 5** as the most similar generated MCQ, as it directly addresses the evolution of life over time, which is a key aspect of the ground truth MCQ.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **5**

**Transcript**:
Without a doubt, the most exciting scientific observation of 2012 was the discovery of a new particle at the CERN laboratory that could be the Higgs boson, a particle named after physicist Peter Higgs. The Higgs Field is thought to give mass to fundamental, subatomic particles like the quarks and leptons that make up ordinary matter. The Higgs bosons are wiggles in the field, like the bump you see when you twitch a rope. But how does this field give mass to particles? If this sounds confusing to you, you're not alone. In 1993, the British Science Minister challenged physicists to invent a simple way to understand all this Higgs stuff. The prize was a bottle of quality champagne. The winning explanation went something like this: Suppose there's a large cocktail party at the CERN laboratory filled with particle physics researchers. This crowd of physicists represents the Higgs field. If a tax collector entered the party, nobody would want to talk to them, and they could very easily cross the room to get to the bar. The tax collector wouldn't interact with the crowd in much the same way that some particles don't interact with the Higgs field. The particles that don't interact, like photons for example, are called massless. Now, suppose that Peter Higgs entered the same room, perhaps in search of a pint. In this case, the physicists will immediately crowd around Higgs to discuss with him their efforts to measure the properties of his namesake boson. Because he interacts strongly with the crowd, Higgs will move slowly across the room. Continuing our analogy, Higgs has become a massive particle through his interactions with the field. So, if that's the Higgs field, how does the Higgs boson fit into all of this? Let's pretend our crowd of party goers is uniformly spread across the room. Now suppose someone pops their head in the door to report a rumor of a discovery at some distant, rival laboratory. People near the door will hear the rumor, but people far away won't, so they'll move closer to the door to ask. This will create a clump in the crowd. As people have heard the rumor, they will return to their original positions to discuss its implications, but people further away will then ask what's going on. The result will be a clump in the crowd that moves across the room. This clump is analogous to the Higgs boson. It is important to remember that it is not that massive particles interact more with the Higgs field. In our analogy of the party, all particles are equal until they enter the room. Both Peter Higgs and the tax collector have zero mass. It is the interaction with the crowd that causes them to gain mass. I'll say that again. Mass comes from interactions with a field. So, let's recap. A particle gets more or less mass depending on how it interacts with a field, just like different people will move through the crowd at different speeds depending on their popularity. And the Higgs boson is just a clump in the field, like a rumor crossing the room. Of course, this analogy is just that -- an analogy, but it's the best analogy anyone has come up with so far. So, that's it. That's what the Higgs Field and the Higgs boson is all about. Continuing research will tell us if we found it, and the reward will probably be more than just a bottle of champagne.

The Higgs bosons are wiggles in the field, like the bump you see when you twitch a rope. But how does this field give mass to particles? If this sounds confusing to you, you're not alone. In 1993, the British Science Minister challenged physicists to invent a simple way to understand all this Higgs stuff. The prize was a bottle of quality champagne. The winning explanation went something like this: Suppose there's a large cocktail party at the CERN laboratory filled with particle physics researchers. This crowd of physicists represents the Higgs field. If a tax collector entered the party, nobody would want to talk to them, and they could very easily cross the room to get to the bar. The tax collector wouldn't interact with the crowd in much the same way that some particles don't interact with the Higgs field. The particles that don't interact, like photons for example, are called massless. Now, suppose that Peter Higgs entered the same room, perhaps in search of a pint. In this case, the physicists will immediately crowd around Higgs to discuss with him their efforts to measure the properties of his namesake boson. Because he interacts strongly with the crowd, Higgs will move slowly across the room. Continuing our analogy, Higgs has become a massive particle through his interactions with the field. So, if that's the Higgs field, how does the Higgs boson fit into all of this? Let's pretend our crowd of party goers is uniformly spread across the room. Now suppose someone pops their head in the door to report a rumor of a discovery at some distant, rival laboratory. People near the door will hear the rumor, but people far away won't, so they'll move closer to the door to ask. This will create a clump in the crowd. As people have heard the rumor, they will return to their original positions to discuss its implications, but people further away will then ask what's going on. The result will be a clump in the crowd that moves across the room. This clump is analogous to the Higgs boson. It is important to remember that it is not that massive particles interact more with the Higgs field. In our analogy of the party, all particles are equal until they enter the room. Both Peter Higgs and the tax collector have zero mass. It is the interaction with the crowd that causes them to gain mass. I'll say that again. Mass comes from interactions with a field. So, let's recap. A particle gets more or less mass depending on how it interacts with a field, just like different people will move through the crowd at different speeds depending on their popularity. And the Higgs boson is just a clump in the field, like a rumor crossing the room. Of course, this analogy is just that -- an analogy, but it's the best analogy anyone has come up with so far. So, that's it. That's what the Higgs Field and the Higgs boson is all about. Continuing research will tell us if we found it, and the reward will probably be more than just a bottle of champagne.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

This question has a similar intent to the ground truth MCQ, as it contrasts massless particles and massive particles in terms of their interaction with the Higgs Field. The correct option (B) states that massless particles do not interact with the Higgs Field, while massive particles do. This aligns with the ground truth MCQ, which states that a particle can have zero mass if it is invisible to the Higgs field (option B). 

While the wording and options are not identical, the underlying concept and intent of the two questions are similar, making Question 8 the most similar generated MCQ.

Some of the issues that are important if you want to have people in space for long periods of time. One is that people will tend to lose bone and muscle mass. We know this. If you have to put a cast on your leg, and you take the cast off after a few weeks, you'll see that your muscles have shrunk in size. And if you measured the bone strength, you'd also see that might have gone down a little bit, too. And so, it's very interesting that our body has that ability to adapt to the loads that are put on it, so that bones and muscles aren't static, they're always changing. While we think of bone as being a solid thing that doesn't change very much, it changes too. And it turns out that in weightlessness, you lose bone. And then you also cause the muscles that work against gravity, what are called the postural muscles, they'll start to shrink and lose strength. There are other things in the cardiovascular system, the heart and blood vessels. And if you think about it, standing up in gravity means you have to work against gravity in order to keep blood pumping to your head. So, if you couldn't keep blood pumping in the head, you'd pass out every time you stood up because when you're lying down, you don't have to push against gravity. But when you stand up, you got to work against gravity to keep blood flowing to your head. And your heart and blood vessels have a really nicely worked-out system to make that happen every time. But that system can also change in weightlessness. And then the other area that changes is the system that has to do with balance. Again, maintaining your balance is something that you're doing against gravity, right? If you didn't have gravity present, you wouldn't have to worry about falling. But you obviously do have to worry about falling, and we have a very highly developed sense of balance to keep us upright and to prevent us from falling. And when you see what skaters do, you realize just how exquisite a system it is. But when you go into weightlessness, your balance system changes. You don't really notice it while you are in weightlessness, but when you come back, you do notice it, that your balance has changed and you have a little bit of trouble maintaining your balance. And what it shows is that while you're in space, your brain is trying to allow you to function in weightlessness. And so, it re-adapts you to be weightless, which you don't notice until you come back and find out that you're now back on Earth with a balance system that's been adapted to space. You know, all life developed here on Earth with gravity being present, so life evolved under the influence of gravity, and then we grow up with gravity being present, so we learn how to walk and catch a ball and ice skate or whatever, all with gravity being present. And what if you were to grow up without gravity? What about the systems that depend on gravity, like your muscles or your balance system or the heart and blood vessels? Would they develop normally, or would they be different in some way? One reason why you might think that it would go down a different pathway is from an experiment that was done some time ago by two neuroscientists called Hubel and Wiesel. And what they did is they had a kitten, and they put a patch over the eye of the kitten. And then the kitten grew up to be a cat, and they removed the patch. And so, the question is, can the cat see out of that eye? Now, there's nothing wrong with the eye, right? But it just hasn't seen anything, there hasn't been any light coming in. And the answer is that the cat can't see out of that eye because what happens is that the brain goes down a different pathway when it develops and the connections that would ordinarily develop to that eye don't develop. And that can't be undone, that's a permanent change. So, the brain of that cat is fundamentally different from the brain of a cat that grew up seeing out of that eye. That cat grew up with a different brain, in essence. So, then you wonder, well, what about gravity? What if you don't have the forces that gravity produces? Is your balance organ going to develop in the same way, or will it be different? If somebody grew up in space, could they come back to Earth and function, or would they really be a different person?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not directly mention bones and muscles, its focus on the body's adaptability to its environment aligns with the ground truth MCQ's statement about bones and muscles not being static. However, it is worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose another option, I would say Question 1 is also related, as it mentions the loss of bone and muscle mass in the context of weightlessness. However, its focus is more on the effects of weightlessness rather than the general statement about bones and muscles being dynamic.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 3, with Question 1 being a close second.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Some of the issues that are important if you want to have people in space for long periods of time. One is that people will tend to lose bone and muscle mass. We know this. If you have to put a cast on your leg, and you take the cast off after a few weeks, you'll see that your muscles have shrunk in size. And if you measured the bone strength, you'd also see that might have gone down a little bit, too. And so, it's very interesting that our body has that ability to adapt to the loads that are put on it, so that bones and muscles aren't static, they're always changing. While we think of bone as being a solid thing that doesn't change very much, it changes too. And it turns out that in weightlessness, you lose bone. And then you also cause the muscles that work against gravity, what are called the postural muscles, they'll start to shrink and lose strength. There are other things in the cardiovascular system, the heart and blood vessels. And if you think about it, standing up in gravity means you have to work against gravity in order to keep blood pumping to your head. So, if you couldn't keep blood pumping in the head, you'd pass out every time you stood up because when you're lying down, you don't have to push against gravity. But when you stand up, you got to work against gravity to keep blood flowing to your head. And your heart and blood vessels have a really nicely worked-out system to make that happen every time. But that system can also change in weightlessness. And then the other area that changes is the system that has to do with balance. Again, maintaining your balance is something that you're doing against gravity, right? If you didn't have gravity present, you wouldn't have to worry about falling. But you obviously do have to worry about falling, and we have a very highly developed sense of balance to keep us upright and to prevent us from falling. And when you see what skaters do, you realize just how exquisite a system it is. But when you go into weightlessness, your balance system changes. You don't really notice it while you are in weightlessness, but when you come back, you do notice it, that your balance has changed and you have a little bit of trouble maintaining your balance. And what it shows is that while you're in space, your brain is trying to allow you to function in weightlessness. And so, it re-adapts you to be weightless, which you don't notice until you come back and find out that you're now back on Earth with a balance system that's been adapted to space. You know, all life developed here on Earth with gravity being present, so life evolved under the influence of gravity, and then we grow up with gravity being present, so we learn how to walk and catch a ball and ice skate or whatever, all with gravity being present. And what if you were to grow up without gravity? What about the systems that depend on gravity, like your muscles or your balance system or the heart and blood vessels? Would they develop normally, or would they be different in some way? One reason why you might think that it would go down a different pathway is from an experiment that was done some time ago by two neuroscientists called Hubel and Wiesel. And what they did is they had a kitten, and they put a patch over the eye of the kitten. And then the kitten grew up to be a cat, and they removed the patch. And so, the question is, can the cat see out of that eye? Now, there's nothing wrong with the eye, right? But it just hasn't seen anything, there hasn't been any light coming in. And the answer is that the cat can't see out of that eye because what happens is that the brain goes down a different pathway when it develops and the connections that would ordinarily develop to that eye don't develop. And that can't be undone, that's a permanent change. So, the brain of that cat is fundamentally different from the brain of a cat that grew up seeing out of that eye. That cat grew up with a different brain, in essence. So, then you wonder, well, what about gravity? What if you don't have the forces that gravity produces? Is your balance organ going to develop in the same way, or will it be different? If somebody grew up in space, could they come back to Earth and function, or would they really be a different person?

**Transcript**:
Have you ever seen a big, red "No Running" sign at a public pool? For the most part, the pace on the deck reflects this statement. But while the sign accurately describes the patrons' movements, isn't it true that people are walking because the sign tells them no running? So, is this sign portraying the pool's environment, or is it doing something else, something more powerful? The difference between a statement that describes and one that commands is an idea developed by British linguist J. L. Austin. He defines this distinction as two separate parts of speech: constatives and performatives. Constatives are sentences that describe something as true or false, and performatives are sentences that denote an action. In other words, a constative is, and a performative does. To help us distinguish these two parts of speech, let's start by examining constatives around the park outside the pool. The first sign we encounter says, "The park closes at 6 p.m." After checking with a friendly park official that the park does, indeed, close at 6, we can confirm that this statement is a true constative. Nearby, there's a man on a bench with a newspaper, and the headline reads, "Heatwave!" However, the sky is cloudy and it feels quite chilly. Today's headline is a false constative as it has proven to be incorrect. Before the rain starts to fall, let's throw away our can of soda at the blue trash bin that says, "Recycle." It's a performative. Performatives are sentences that are meant to inspire actions. Rather than conveying a message, it acts upon the world, it does something. In this case, the performative of "Recycle" is requesting people to put their trash into the proper receptacle. Words not only bring about actions, sometimes words themselves are actions. This is what is known as speech acts. These actions include, but are not limited to, ordering, promising, apologizing, warning, sentencing, christening, and even marrying. Take a look at the wedding near the gazebo. The couple says the words, "I do." The speech act here are the words, "I do." These words cause them to marry one another. "I do" has acted upon them and profoundly changed their world. However, performatives depend on context and reception. These are known as felicity conditions. Imagine if the mayor showed up to the wedding and said, "By the power vested in me as mayor of the city, I name this gazebo 'The Mayor's Pizza Palace.'" His words would be a speech act by which he named the gazebo. And because he's the mayor, the gazebo would be known by its new name. But if someone who isn't the mayor, just a normal passerby, decides to name the gazebo after her favorite cat, the chances are the name would not change. Felicity conditions are the rules under which the performative can be enacted. These are fairly logical. The performative should have proper authority, it should be understood, it should be clear, and it should be able to be executed. If the performative doesn't meet these conditions, then it doesn't have the power to denote action. But just because a performative meets its conditions and is clearly stated, doesn't mean that it's implicitly followed. Back at the pool, a rowdy group of teenagers races to the high dive. "No running" does not seem to have power over them, and they'll have to face the consequences of breaking this performative. They may even have to force out some performatives of their own, such as apologizing to the life guard and promising to never run again. Maybe the life guard will respond with another performative, sentencing them to be banished from the pool for the rest of the day. After all, these teenagers must learn to respect the power of words.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever seen a big, red "No Running" sign at a public pool? For the most part, the pace on the deck reflects this statement. But while the sign accurately describes the patrons' movements, isn't it true that people are walking because the sign tells them no running? So, is this sign portraying the pool's environment, or is it doing something else, something more powerful? The difference between a statement that describes and one that commands is an idea developed by British linguist J. L. Austin. He defines this distinction as two separate parts of speech: constatives and performatives. Constatives are sentences that describe something as true or false, and performatives are sentences that denote an action. In other words, a constative is, and a performative does. To help us distinguish these two parts of speech, let's start by examining constatives around the park outside the pool. The first sign we encounter says, "The park closes at 6 p.m." After checking with a friendly park official that the park does, indeed, close at 6, we can confirm that this statement is a true constative. Nearby, there's a man on a bench with a newspaper, and the headline reads, "Heatwave!" However, the sky is cloudy and it feels quite chilly. Today's headline is a false constative as it has proven to be incorrect. Before the rain starts to fall, let's throw away our can of soda at the blue trash bin that says, "Recycle." It's a performative. Performatives are sentences that are meant to inspire actions. Rather than conveying a message, it acts upon the world, it does something. In this case, the performative of "Recycle" is requesting people to put their trash into the proper receptacle. Words not only bring about actions, sometimes words themselves are actions. This is what is known as speech acts. These actions include, but are not limited to, ordering, promising, apologizing, warning, sentencing, christening, and even marrying. Take a look at the wedding near the gazebo. The couple says the words, "I do." The speech act here are the words, "I do." These words cause them to marry one another. "I do" has acted upon them and profoundly changed their world. However, performatives depend on context and reception. These are known as felicity conditions. Imagine if the mayor showed up to the wedding and said, "By the power vested in me as mayor of the city, I name this gazebo 'The Mayor's Pizza Palace.'" His words would be a speech act by which he named the gazebo. And because he's the mayor, the gazebo would be known by its new name. But if someone who isn't the mayor, just a normal passerby, decides to name the gazebo after her favorite cat, the chances are the name would not change. Felicity conditions are the rules under which the performative can be enacted. These are fairly logical. The performative should have proper authority, it should be understood, it should be clear, and it should be able to be executed. If the performative doesn't meet these conditions, then it doesn't have the power to denote action. But just because a performative meets its conditions and is clearly stated, doesn't mean that it's implicitly followed. Back at the pool, a rowdy group of teenagers races to the high dive. "No running" does not seem to have power over them, and they'll have to face the consequences of breaking this performative. They may even have to force out some performatives of their own, such as apologizing to the life guard and promising to never run again. Maybe the life guard will respond with another performative, sentencing them to be banished from the pool for the rest of the day. After all, these teenagers must learn to respect the power of words.

**Transcript**:
Nicolas Steno is rarely heard of outside Intro to Geology, but anyone hoping to understand life on Earth should see how Steno expanded and connected those very concepts: Earth, life, and understanding. Born Niels Stensen in 1638 Denmark, son of a goldsmith, he was a sickly kid whose school chums died of plague. He survived to cut up corpses as an anatomist, studying organs shared across species. He found a duct in animal skulls that sends saliva to the mouth. He refuted Descartes' idea that only humans had a pineal gland, proving it wasn't the seat of the soul, arguably, the debut of neuroscience. Most remarkable for the time was his method. Steno never let ancient texts, Aristotelian metaphysics, or Cartesian deductions overrule empirical, experimental evidence. His vision, uncluttered by speculation or rationalization, went deep. Steno had seen how gallstones form in wet organs by accretion. They obeyed molding principles he knew from the goldsmith trade, rules useful across disciplines for understanding solids by their structural relationships. Later, the Grand Duke of Tuscany had him dissect a shark. Its teeth resembled tongue stones, odd rocks seen inside other rocks in Malta and the mountains near Florence. Pliny the Elder, old Roman naturalist, said these fell from the sky. In the Dark Ages, folks said they were snake tongues, petrified by Saint Paul. Steno saw that tongue stones were shark teeth and vice versa, with the same signs of structural growth. Figuring similar things are made in similar ways, he argued the ancient teeth came from ancient sharks in waters that formed rock around the teeth and became mountains. Rock layers were once layers of watery sediment, which would lay out horizontally, one atop another, oldest up to newest. If layers were deformed, tilted, cut by a fault or a canyon, that change came after the layer formed. Sounds simple today; back then, revolutionary. He'd invented stratigraphy and laid geology's ground work. By finding one origin for shark teeth from two eras by stating natural laws ruling the present also ruled the past, Steno planted seeds for uniformitarianism, the idea that the past was shaped by processes observable today. In the 18th and 19th centuries, English uniformitarian geologists, James Hutton and Charles Lyell, studied current, very slow rates of erosion and sedimentation and realized the Earth had to be way older than the biblical guestimate, 6000 years. Out of their work came the rock cycle, which combined with plate tectonics in the mid-twentieth century to give us the great molten-crusting, quaking, all-encircling theory of the Earth, from a gallstone to a 4.5 billion-year-old planet. Now think bigger, take it to biology. Say you see shark teeth in one layer and a fossil of an organism you've never seen under that. The deeper fossil's older, yes? You now have evidence of the origin and extinction of species over time. Get uniformitarian. Maybe a process still active today caused changes not just in rocks but in life. It might also explain similarities and differences between species found by anatomists like Steno. It's a lot to ponder, but Charles Darwin had the time on a long trip to the Galapagos, reading a copy of his friend Charles Lyell's "Principles of Geology," which Steno sort of founded. Sometimes giants stand on the shoulders of curious little people. Nicolas Steno helped evolve evolution, broke ground for geology, and showed how unbiased, empirical observation can cut across intellectual borders to deepen our perspective. His finest accomplishment, though, may be his maxim, casting the search for truth beyond our senses and our current understanding as the pursuit of the beauty of the as yet unknown. Beautiful is what we see, more beautiful is what we know, most beautiful, by far, is what we don't.

Nicolas Steno is rarely heard of outside Intro to Geology, but anyone hoping to understand life on Earth should see how Steno expanded and connected those very concepts: Earth, life, and understanding. Born Niels Stensen in 1638 Denmark, son of a goldsmith, he was a sickly kid whose school chums died of plague. He survived to cut up corpses as an anatomist, studying organs shared across species. He found a duct in animal skulls that sends saliva to the mouth. He refuted Descartes' idea that only humans had a pineal gland, proving it wasn't the seat of the soul, arguably, the debut of neuroscience. Most remarkable for the time was his method. Steno never let ancient texts, Aristotelian metaphysics, or Cartesian deductions overrule empirical, experimental evidence. His vision, uncluttered by speculation or rationalization, went deep. Steno had seen how gallstones form in wet organs by accretion. They obeyed molding principles he knew from the goldsmith trade, rules useful across disciplines for understanding solids by their structural relationships. Later, the Grand Duke of Tuscany had him dissect a shark. Its teeth resembled tongue stones, odd rocks seen inside other rocks in Malta and the mountains near Florence. Pliny the Elder, old Roman naturalist, said these fell from the sky. In the Dark Ages, folks said they were snake tongues, petrified by Saint Paul. Steno saw that tongue stones were shark teeth and vice versa, with the same signs of structural growth. Figuring similar things are made in similar ways, he argued the ancient teeth came from ancient sharks in waters that formed rock around the teeth and became mountains. Rock layers were once layers of watery sediment, which would lay out horizontally, one atop another, oldest up to newest. If layers were deformed, tilted, cut by a fault or a canyon, that change came after the layer formed. Sounds simple today; back then, revolutionary. He'd invented stratigraphy and laid geology's ground work. By finding one origin for shark teeth from two eras by stating natural laws ruling the present also ruled the past, Steno planted seeds for uniformitarianism, the idea that the past was shaped by processes observable today. In the 18th and 19th centuries, English uniformitarian geologists, James Hutton and Charles Lyell, studied current, very slow rates of erosion and sedimentation and realized the Earth had to be way older than the biblical guestimate, 6000 years. Out of their work came the rock cycle, which combined with plate tectonics in the mid-twentieth century to give us the great molten-crusting, quaking, all-encircling theory of the Earth, from a gallstone to a 4.5 billion-year-old planet. Now think bigger, take it to biology. Say you see shark teeth in one layer and a fossil of an organism you've never seen under that. The deeper fossil's older, yes? You now have evidence of the origin and extinction of species over time. Get uniformitarian. Maybe a process still active today caused changes not just in rocks but in life. It might also explain similarities and differences between species found by anatomists like Steno. It's a lot to ponder, but Charles Darwin had the time on a long trip to the Galapagos, reading a copy of his friend Charles Lyell's "Principles of Geology," which Steno sort of founded. Sometimes giants stand on the shoulders of curious little people. Nicolas Steno helped evolve evolution, broke ground for geology, and showed how unbiased, empirical observation can cut across intellectual borders to deepen our perspective. His finest accomplishment, though, may be his maxim, casting the search for truth beyond our senses and our current understanding as the pursuit of the beauty of the as yet unknown. Beautiful is what we see, more beautiful is what we know, most beautiful, by far, is what we don't.

**Transcript**:
To many, one of the coolest things
about "Game of Thrones" is that the inhabitants
of the Dothraki Sea have their own real language. And Dothraki came hot on the heels of the real language
that the Na'vi speak in "Avatar," which, surely, the Na'vi needed when the Klingons in "Star Trek" have had
their own whole language since 1979. And let's not forget the Elvish languages in J.R.R. Tolkien's
"Lord of the Rings" trilogy, especially since that was
the official grandfather of the fantasy conlangs. "Conlang" is short for
"constructed language." They're more than codes like Pig Latin, and they're not just collections
of fabricated slang like the Nadsat lingo that the teen hoodlums
in "A Clockwork Orange" speak, where "droog" from Russian
happens to mean "friend." What makes conlangs real languages
isn't the number of words they have. It helps, of course,
to have a lot of words. Dothraki has thousands of words. Na'vi started with 1,500 words. Fans on websites
have steadily created more. But we can see the difference
between vocabulary alone and what makes a real language from a look at how Tolkien
put together grand old Elvish, a conlang with several thousands words. After all, you could memorize
5,000 words of Russian and still be barely able
to construct a sentence. A four-year-old would talk
rings around you. That's because you have to know
how to put the words together. That is, a real language has grammar. Elvish does. In English, to make a verb past,
you add an "-ed." Wash, washed. In Elvish, "wash" is "allu" and "washed" is "allune." Real languages also change over time. There's no such thing as a language that's the same today
as it was a thousand years ago. As people speak, they drift

hlaf syle us todaeg." Things change in conlangs, too. Tolkien charted out ancient
and newer versions of Elvish. When the first Elves awoke at Cuiviénen, in their new language, the word for "people" was "kwendi," but in the language of one of the groups
that moved away, Teleri, over time, "kwendi" became "pendi," with the "k" turning into a "p." And just like real languages,
conlangs like Elvish split off into many. When the Romans transplanted
Latin across Europe, French, Spanish, and Italian were born. When groups move to different places, over time, their ways
of speaking grow apart, just like everything else about them. Thus, Latin's word for hand was "manus," but in French, it became "main," while in Spain it became "mano." Tolkien made sure Elvish
did the same kind of thing. While that original word
"kwendi" became "pendi" among the Teleri, among the Avari, who spread
throughout Middle Earth, it became "kindi"
when the "w" dropped out. The Elvish varieties Tolkien
fleshed out the most are Quenya and Sindarin, and their words are different
in the same way French and Spanish are. Quenya has "suc" for "drink," Sindarin has "sog." And as you know, real languages are messy. That's because they change, and change has a way
of working against order, just like in a living room
or on a bookshelf. Real languages are never
perfectly logical. That's why Tolkien made sure
that Elvish had plenty of exceptions. Lots of verbs are conjugated
in ways you just have to know. Take even the word "know." In the past, it's "knew," which isn't explained
by any of the rules in English. Oh well. In Elvish, "know" is "ista," but "knew" is "sinte." Oh well. The truth is, though, that Elvish
is more a sketch for a real language than a whole one. For Tolkien, Elvish was a hobby rather than an attempt to create something
people could actually speak. Much of the Elvish the characters
in the "Lord of the Rings" movies speak has been made up since Tolkien
by dedicated fans of Elvish based on guesses as to what Tolkien
would have constructed. That's the best we can do for Elvish
because there are no actual Elves around to speak it for us. But the modern conlangs go further. Dothraki, Na'vi, and Klingon
are developed enough that you can actually speak them. Here's a translation
of "Hamlet" into Klingon, although performing it
would mean getting used to pronouncing "k" with your uvula, that weird, cartoony thing hanging
in the back of your throat. Believe it or not, you actually do that
in plenty of languages around the world, like Eskimo ones. Pronouncing Elvish is much easier, though. So, let's take our leave for now from this introduction

quad-conlangual valedictory: "A Na Marie!" "Hajas!" Na'vi's "Kiyevame!" "Qapla!" and "Goodbye!"

**Transcript**:
To many, one of the coolest things
about "Game of Thrones" is that the inhabitants
of the Dothraki Sea have their own real language. And Dothraki came hot on the heels of the real language
that the Na'vi speak in "Avatar," which, surely, the Na'vi needed when the Klingons in "Star Trek" have had
their own whole language since 1979. And let's not forget the Elvish languages in J.R.R. Tolkien's
"Lord of the Rings" trilogy, especially since that was
the official grandfather of the fantasy conlangs. "Conlang" is short for
"constructed language." They're more than codes like Pig Latin, and they're not just collections
of fabricated slang like the Nadsat lingo that the teen hoodlums
in "A Clockwork Orange" speak, where "droog" from Russian
happens to mean "friend." What makes conlangs real languages
isn't the number of words they have. It helps, of course,
to have a lot of words. Dothraki has thousands of words. Na'vi started with 1,500 words. Fans on websites
have steadily created more. But we can see the difference
between vocabulary alone and what makes a real language from a look at how Tolkien
put together grand old Elvish, a conlang with several thousands words. After all, you could memorize
5,000 words of Russian and still be barely able
to construct a sentence. A four-year-old would talk
rings around you. That's because you have to know
how to put the words together. That is, a real language has grammar. Elvish does. In English, to make a verb past,
you add an "-ed." Wash, washed. In Elvish, "wash" is "allu" and "washed" is "allune." Real languages also change over time. There's no such thing as a language that's the same today
as it was a thousand years ago. As people speak, they drift
into new habits, shed old ones, make mistakes, and get creative. Today, one says, "Give us today our daily bread." In Old English, they said, "Urne gedaeghwamlican
hlaf syle us todaeg." Things change in conlangs, too. Tolkien charted out ancient
and newer versions of Elvish. When the first Elves awoke at Cuiviénen, in their new language, the word for "people" was "kwendi," but in the language of one of the groups
that moved away, Teleri, over time, "kwendi" became "pendi," with the "k" turning into a "p." And just like real languages,
conlangs like Elvish split off into many. When the Romans transplanted
Latin across Europe, French, Spanish, and Italian were born. When groups move to different places, over time, their ways

[Music] [Music] so can we dare to be optimistic well the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years and hence diverging from the rest of mankind and so the real question to pose is not can we be optimistic it's how can we give credible hope to that billion people that to my mind is the fundamental challenge now of development what I'm going to offer you is a recipe a combination of the two forces that change the world for good which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest compassion because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope that is a human tragedy enlightened self-interest because if that economic Divergence continues for another 40 years combined with social integration globally it will build a nightmare for our children we need compassion to get ourselves started an enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious that's the alliance that changes the world so what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion what can we actually do well a good guide is to think what did we do last time the rich World got serious about developing another region of the world that gives us turns out quite a good clue except you have to go back quite a long time the last time the rich World got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s the rich world was you America and and the region that needed to be developed was my world Europe that was post-war Europe why did America get serious it wasn't just compassion for Europe though there was that it was you knew you had to because in the late 1940s country after country in Central Europe was falling into the Soviet block and so you knew you'd no choice Europe had had to be dragged into Economic Development so what did you do last time you got serious well yes you had a big aid program thank you very much that was martial Aid we need to do it again Aid is part of the solution but what else did you do well you tore up your trade policy and totally reversed it before the war America had been highly protectionist after the war War you open your markets to Europe you drag Europe into the then global economy which was your economy and you institutionalize that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement of tariffs and trade so total reversal of trade policy did you do anything else yes you totally reversed your security policy before the war your security policy had been isolationist after the war you tear that up you put 100,000 troops in Europe for over 40 years so total reversal of security policy anything else yes you tear up the 11th commandment National sovereignty before the war you treated National sovereignty as so sacran that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations after the war you found the United Nations you found the organization for economic cooperation and development you found the IMF you encourage Europe to create the European Community all systems for Mutual governance support that is still the Waterfront of effective policies Aid trade security governments of course the details of policy are going to be different because the challenge is different it's not rebuilding Europe it's re reversing the Divergence of the bottom billion so that they actually catch up is that easier or harder we need to be at least as serious as we were then now today I'm going to take just one of those four I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest the one that's just motherhood and apple pie governance Mutual systems of support for governance and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now the uh opportunity we're going to look to is um is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billian and that is the commodity Booms The commodity booms are pumping un unprecedented amounts of money into many though not all of the countries of the bottom billion partly they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high but it's not just that there's also a range of new discoveries uganda's just discovered oil and about the most disastrous location on Earth Ghana's discovered oil Guinea has got a huge new exploit exploitation of iron oil coming out of the ground so mass of new discoveries between them these new Revenue flows dwarf Aid just to give you one one example Angola alone is getting $50 billion a year in oil Revenue the entire Aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion so the the the flow of resources from the commodity Booms to the bottom billion are without precedent so there's the optimism the question is how is it going to help their development it's a huge opportunity for transformational development will it be taken so here comes a bit of Science and this is a bit of science I've done since the bottom billion so it's new I've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports and the growth of commodity exporting countries and I've looked globally I've taken all the countries in the world for the last 40 years and looked to see what the relationship is and the the short run say the first 5 to seven years is just great in fact it's hunky dory everything goes up right you get more money because your terms of trade have improved but also that drives up output across the board so GDP goes up a lot fantastic that's the short run and how about the long run come back 15 years later well the short run it's hunky dory but the long run it's Humpty Dumpty you go up in the short run but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all that is not a forecast about how commodity prices go it's a forecast of the consequences the long-term consequences of for growth of an increase in prices so what goes wrong why is there this resource curse as it's called and again I've looked at that and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance the initial level of economic governance when there is orce booms acrew in fact if you've got good enough governance there is no resource boom you go up in the short term and then you go up even more in the long term that's Norway the richest country in Europe it's Australia it's Canada the resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance they still go up in the short run that's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment the best growth rates they've had ever and the question is whether the short run will persist with bad governance historically over the last 40 years it hasn't it's countries like Nigeria which are worse off than if they never had oil so there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term below which you go down just to Benchmark that threshold it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s so the question is are the bottom Billy and a above or below that threshold now there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s and that is the spread of democracy so I thought well maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy so I looked democracy does have significant effects and unfortunately they're adverse democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies at that stage I just wanted to abandon the research but it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that because there are two distinct aspects of democracy there's electoral competition which determines how you acquire power and there's checks and balances which determine how you use power it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy where our strong checks and balances make resource booms good and so what the countries of the botom billion need is very strong checks and balances they haven't got them they got instant democracy in the 1990s elections without checks and balances how can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances in all the societies of the bottom billion there are intense struggles to do just that the simple proposal is that we should have some International standards which would be voluntary but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order for to harness these resource revenues we know these International standards work because we've already got one it's called the extractive industries transparency initiative that is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have no sooner was it proposed than reformers in Nigeria adopted it pushed it published the revenues in the paper Nigerian newspaper circulation spiked people wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of Revenue so we know it works what would the content be of these International standards I can't go through all of them but I'll give you an example the first is how to take the resources out of the ground the economic process is taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the ground and the first step in that is selling the rights to Resource extraction you know how rights to Resource extraction are being sold at the moment how they've been sold over the last 40 years a company flies in does a deal with a minister and that's great for the company and it's quite often great for the minister right and it's not great for the country there's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that and it's called verified auctions the uh the public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury that is the British Treasury and the British treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth it worked out worth2 billion just in time a set of economists got there and said why not try an auction it'll reveal the value it went for2 billion through auction if the British treasury can be out by a factor of 10 think what the Ministry of Finance in Sierra Leon is going to be like when I put that to the president of Sierra Leon the next day he asked the World Bank to send in a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions there are five such decision Points each one needs an international standard if we could do it we would change the world we would be helping the reformers in these societies who are struggling for change that's our modest role we cannot change these societies but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing because the odds are so stacked against them and yet we've not got these rules if you think about it the cost of promulgating international rules is Sil nothing why on Earth are they not there I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies politicians will get away with gestures the the that unless we have an informed Society what politicians do especially in relation to Africa is gestures things that look good but don't work and so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry that's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach however I have to say the process of communication does not come naturally to me this is why I'm on this stage but it's alarming right I grew up in a culture uh of self

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so can we dare to be optimistic well the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years and hence diverging from the rest of mankind and so the real question to pose is not can we be optimistic it's how can we give credible hope to that billion people that to my mind is the fundamental challenge now of development what I'm going to offer you is a recipe a combination of the two forces that change the world for good which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest compassion because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope that is a human tragedy enlightened self-interest because if that economic Divergence continues for another 40 years combined with social integration globally it will build a nightmare for our children we need compassion to get ourselves started an enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious that's the alliance that changes the world so what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion what can we actually do well a good guide is to think what did we do last time the rich World got serious about developing another region of the world that gives us turns out quite a good clue except you have to go back quite a long time the last time the rich World got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s the rich world was you America and and the region that needed to be developed was my world Europe that was post-war Europe why did America get serious it wasn't just compassion for Europe though there was that it was you knew you had to because in the late 1940s country after country in Central Europe was falling into the Soviet block and so you knew you'd no choice Europe had had to be dragged into Economic Development so what did you do last time you got serious well yes you had a big aid program thank you very much that was martial Aid we need to do it again Aid is part of the solution but what else did you do well you tore up your trade policy and totally reversed it before the war America had been highly protectionist after the war War you open your markets to Europe you drag Europe into the then global economy which was your economy and you institutionalize that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement of tariffs and trade so total reversal of trade policy did you do anything else yes you totally reversed your security policy before the war your security policy had been isolationist after the war you tear that up you put 100,000 troops in Europe for over 40 years so total reversal of security policy anything else yes you tear up the 11th commandment National sovereignty before the war you treated National sovereignty as so sacran that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations after the war you found the United Nations you found the organization for economic cooperation and development you found the IMF you encourage Europe to create the European Community all systems for Mutual governance support that is still the Waterfront of effective policies Aid trade security governments of course the details of policy are going to be different because the challenge is different it's not rebuilding Europe it's re reversing the Divergence of the bottom billion so that they actually catch up is that easier or harder we need to be at least as serious as we were then now today I'm going to take just one of those four I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest the one that's just motherhood and apple pie governance Mutual systems of support for governance and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now the uh opportunity we're going to look to is um is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billian and that is the commodity Booms The commodity booms are pumping un unprecedented amounts of money into many though not all of the countries of the bottom billion partly they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high but it's not just that there's also a range of new discoveries uganda's just discovered oil and about the most disastrous location on Earth Ghana's discovered oil Guinea has got a huge new exploit exploitation of iron oil coming out of the ground so mass of new discoveries between them these new Revenue flows dwarf Aid just to give you one one example Angola alone is getting $50 billion a year in oil Revenue the entire Aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion so the the the flow of resources from the commodity Booms to the bottom billion are without precedent so there's the optimism the question is how is it going to help their development it's a huge opportunity for transformational development will it be taken so here comes a bit of Science and this is a bit of science I've done since the bottom billion so it's new I've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports and the growth of commodity exporting countries and I've looked globally I've taken all the countries in the world for the last 40 years and looked to see what the relationship is and the the short run say the first 5 to seven years is just great in fact it's hunky dory everything goes up right you get more money because your terms of trade have improved but also that drives up output across the board so GDP goes up a lot fantastic that's the short run and how about the long run come back 15 years later well the short run it's hunky dory but the long run it's Humpty Dumpty you go up in the short run but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all that is not a forecast about how commodity prices go it's a forecast of the consequences the long-term consequences of for growth of an increase in prices so what goes wrong why is there this resource curse as it's called and again I've looked at that and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance the initial level of economic governance when there is orce booms acrew in fact if you've got good enough governance there is no resource boom you go up in the short term and then you go up even more in the long term that's Norway the richest country in Europe it's Australia it's Canada the resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance they still go up in the short run that's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment the best growth rates they've had ever and the question is whether the short run will persist with bad governance historically over the last 40 years it hasn't it's countries like Nigeria which are worse off than if they never had oil so there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term below which you go down just to Benchmark that threshold it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s so the question is are the bottom Billy and a above or below that threshold now there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s and that is the spread of democracy so I thought well maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy so I looked democracy does have significant effects and unfortunately they're adverse democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies at that stage I just wanted to abandon the research but it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that because there are two distinct aspects of democracy there's electoral competition which determines how you acquire power and there's checks and balances which determine how you use power it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy where our strong checks and balances make resource booms good and so what the countries of the botom billion need is very strong checks and balances they haven't got them they got instant democracy in the 1990s elections without checks and balances how can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances in all the societies of the bottom billion there are intense struggles to do just that the simple proposal is that we should have some International standards which would be voluntary but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order for to harness these resource revenues we know these International standards work because we've already got one it's called the extractive industries transparency initiative that is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have no sooner was it proposed than reformers in Nigeria adopted it pushed it published the revenues in the paper Nigerian newspaper circulation spiked people wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of Revenue so we know it works what would the content be of these International standards I can't go through all of them but I'll give you an example the first is how to take the resources out of the ground the economic process is taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the ground and the first step in that is selling the rights to Resource extraction you know how rights to Resource extraction are being sold at the moment how they've been sold over the last 40 years a company flies in does a deal with a minister and that's great for the company and it's quite often great for the minister right and it's not great for the country there's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that and it's called verified auctions the uh the public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury that is the British Treasury and the British treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth it worked out worth2 billion just in time a set of economists got there and said why not try an auction it'll reveal the value it went for2 billion through auction if the British treasury can be out by a factor of 10 think what the Ministry of Finance in Sierra Leon is going to be like when I put that to the president of Sierra Leon the next day he asked the World Bank to send in a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions there are five such decision Points each one needs an international standard if we could do it we would change the world we would be helping the reformers in these societies who are struggling for change that's our modest role we cannot change these societies but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing because the odds are so stacked against them and yet we've not got these rules if you think about it the cost of promulgating international rules is Sil nothing why on Earth are they not there I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies politicians will get away with gestures the the that unless we have an informed Society what politicians do especially in relation to Africa is gestures things that look good but don't work and so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry that's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach however I have to say the process of communication does not come naturally to me this is why I'm on this stage but it's alarming right I grew up in a culture uh of self effacement um my wife showed me a a Blog comment on one of my last talks and the blog comment said Kia is not charismatic but his arguments are compelling [Applause] if if you agree with that sentiment and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry you will realize that I'm need you please become ambassadors thank [Applause] [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so can we dare to be optimistic well the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years and hence diverging from the rest of mankind and so the real question to pose is not can we be optimistic it's how can we give credible hope to that billion people that to my mind is the fundamental challenge now of development what I'm going to offer you is a recipe a combination of the two forces that change the world for good which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest compassion because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope that is a human tragedy enlightened self-interest because if that economic Divergence continues for another 40 years combined with social integration globally it will build a nightmare for our children we need compassion to get ourselves started an enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious that's the alliance that changes the world so what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion what can we actually do well a good guide is to think what did we do last time the rich World got serious about developing another region of the world that gives us turns out quite a good clue except you have to go back quite a long time the last time the rich World got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s the rich world was you America and and the region that needed to be developed was my world Europe that was post-war Europe why did America get serious it wasn't just compassion for Europe though there was that it was you knew you had to because in the late 1940s country after country in Central Europe was falling into the Soviet block and so you knew you'd no choice Europe had had to be dragged into Economic Development so what did you do last time you got serious well yes you had a big aid program thank you very much that was martial Aid we need to do it again Aid is part of the solution but what else did you do well you tore up your trade policy and totally reversed it before the war America had been highly protectionist after the war War you open your markets to Europe you drag Europe into the then global economy which was your economy and you institutionalize that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement of tariffs and trade so total reversal of trade policy did you do anything else yes you totally reversed your security policy before the war your security policy had been isolationist after the war you tear that up you put 100,000 troops in Europe for over 40 years so total reversal of security policy anything else yes you tear up the 11th commandment National sovereignty before the war you treated National sovereignty as so sacran that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations after the war you found the United Nations you found the organization for economic cooperation and development you found the IMF you encourage Europe to create the European Community all systems for Mutual governance support that is still the Waterfront of effective policies Aid trade security governments of course the details of policy are going to be different because the challenge is different it's not rebuilding Europe it's re reversing the Divergence of the bottom billion so that they actually catch up is that easier or harder we need to be at least as serious as we were then now today I'm going to take just one of those four I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest the one that's just motherhood and apple pie governance Mutual systems of support for governance and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now the uh opportunity we're going to look to is um is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billian and that is the commodity Booms The commodity booms are pumping un unprecedented amounts of money into many though not all of the countries of the bottom billion partly they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high but it's not just that there's also a range of new discoveries uganda's just discovered oil and about the most disastrous location on Earth Ghana's discovered oil Guinea has got a huge new exploit exploitation of iron oil coming out of the ground so mass of new discoveries between them these new Revenue flows dwarf Aid just to give you one one example Angola alone is getting $50 billion a year in oil Revenue the entire Aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion so the the the flow of resources from the commodity Booms to the bottom billion are without precedent so there's the optimism the question is how is it going to help their development it's a huge opportunity for transformational development will it be taken so here comes a bit of Science and this is a bit of science I've done since the bottom billion so it's new I've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports and the growth of commodity exporting countries and I've looked globally I've taken all the countries in the world for the last 40 years and looked to see what the relationship is and the the short run say the first 5 to seven years is just great in fact it's hunky dory everything goes up right you get more money because your terms of trade have improved but also that drives up output across the board so GDP goes up a lot fantastic that's the short run and how about the long run come back 15 years later well the short run it's hunky dory but the long run it's Humpty Dumpty you go up in the short run but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all that is not a forecast about how commodity prices go it's a forecast of the consequences the long-term consequences of for growth of an increase in prices so what goes wrong why is there this resource curse as it's called and again I've looked at that and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance the initial level of economic governance when there is orce booms acrew in fact if you've got good enough governance there is no resource boom you go up in the short term and then you go up even more in the long term that's Norway the richest country in Europe it's Australia it's Canada the resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance they still go up in the short run that's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment the best growth rates they've had ever and the question is whether the short run will persist with bad governance historically over the last 40 years it hasn't it's countries like Nigeria which are worse off than if they never had oil so there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term below which you go down just to Benchmark that threshold it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s so the question is are the bottom Billy and a above or below that threshold now there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s and that is the spread of democracy so I thought well maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy so I looked democracy does have significant effects and unfortunately they're adverse democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies at that stage I just wanted to abandon the research but it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that because there are two distinct aspects of democracy there's electoral competition which determines how you acquire power and there's checks and balances which determine how you use power it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy where our strong checks and balances make resource booms good and so what the countries of the botom billion need is very strong checks and balances they haven't got them they got instant democracy in the 1990s elections without checks and balances how can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances in all the societies of the bottom billion there are intense struggles to do just that the simple proposal is that we should have some International standards which would be voluntary but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order for to harness these resource revenues we know these International standards work because we've already got one it's called the extractive industries transparency initiative that is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have no sooner was it proposed than reformers in Nigeria adopted it pushed it published the revenues in the paper Nigerian newspaper circulation spiked people wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of Revenue so we know it works what would the content be of these International standards I can't go through all of them but I'll give you an example the first is how to take the resources out of the ground the economic process is taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the ground and the first step in that is selling the rights to Resource extraction you know how rights to Resource extraction are being sold at the moment how they've been sold over the last 40 years a company flies in does a deal with a minister and that's great for the company and it's quite often great for the minister right and it's not great for the country there's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that and it's called verified auctions the uh the public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury that is the British Treasury and the British treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth it worked out worth2 billion just in time a set of economists got there and said why not try an auction it'll reveal the value it went for2 billion through auction if the British treasury can be out by a factor of 10 think what the Ministry of Finance in Sierra Leon is going to be like when I put that to the president of Sierra Leon the next day he asked the World Bank to send in a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions there are five such decision Points each one needs an international standard if we could do it we would change the world we would be helping the reformers in these societies who are struggling for change that's our modest role we cannot change these societies but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing because the odds are so stacked against them and yet we've not got these rules if you think about it the cost of promulgating international rules is Sil nothing why on Earth are they not there I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies politicians will get away with gestures the the that unless we have an informed Society what politicians do especially in relation to Africa is gestures things that look good but don't work and so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry that's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach however I have to say the process of communication does not come naturally to me this is why I'm on this stage but it's alarming right I grew up in a culture uh of self effacement um my wife showed me a a Blog comment on one of my last talks and the blog comment said Kia is not charismatic but his arguments are compelling [Applause] if if you agree with that sentiment and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry you will realize that I'm need you please become ambassadors thank [Applause] [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
English, like all languages, is a messy business. You can be uncouth but not couth. You can be ruthless, but good luck trying to show somebody that you have ruth unless you happen to be married to someone named Ruth. It's bad to be unkempt but impossible to be kempt, or sheveled as opposed to disheveled. There are other things that make no more sense than those but that seem normal now because the sands of time have buried where they came from. For example, did you ever wonder why a nickname for Edward is Ned? Where'd the N come from? It's the same with Nellie for Ellen. Afterall, if someone's name is Ethan, we don't nickname him Nethan, nor do we call our favorite Maria, Nmaria. In fact, if anyone did, our primary urge would be to either scold them or gently hide them away until the company had departed. All these nicknames trace back to a mistake, although, a perfectly understandable one. In fact, even the word nickname is weird. What's so "nick" about a nickname? Is it that it's a name that has a nick in it? Let's face it, not likely. Actually, in Old English, the word was ekename, and eke meant also or other. You can see eke still used in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in a sentence like, "Whan Zephyrus eek with his sweete breeth," which meant, "When Zephyr also with his sweet breath." Ekename meant "also name." What happened was that when people said, "an ekename," it could sound like they were saying, "a nekename," and after a while, so many people were hearing it that way that they started saying, "That's my nickname," instead of, "That's my ekename." Now, the word had a stray n at the front that started as a mistake, but from now on was what the word really was. It was rather as if you had gum on the bottom of your shoe and stepped on a leaf, dragged that leaf along for the rest of your life, were buried wearing that shoe and went to heaven in it to spend eternity wedded to that stray, worn-out leaf. Ekename picked up an n and never let it go. The same thing happened with other words. Old English speakers cut otches into wood. But after centuries of being asked to cut an otch into something, it was easy to think you were cutting a notch instead, and pretty soon you were. In a world where almost no one could read, it was easier for what people heard to become, after awhile, what it started to actually be. Here's where the Ned-style nicknames come in. Old English was more like German than our English is now, and just as in German, my is mein, in Old English, my was meen. You would say meen book, actually boke in Old English, or meen cat. And just as today, we might refer to our child as my Dahlia or my Laura, in Old English, they would say, "Meen Ed". That is mein Ed, mein Ellie. You see where this is going. As time passed, meen morphed into the my we know today. That meant that when people said, "Mein Ed," it sounded like they were saying my Ned. That is, it sounded like whenever someone referred to Edward affectionately, they said Ned instead of Ed. Behold, the birth of a nickname! Or an ekename. Hence, also Nellie for Ellen and Nan for Ann, and even in the old days, Nabby for Abigal. President John Adam's wife Abigail's nickname was Nabby. All sorts of words are like this. Old English speakers wore naprons, but a napron sounds like an apron, and that gave birth to a word apron that no one in Beowulf would have recognized. Umpire started as numpires, too. If all of this sounds like something sloppy that we modern people would never do, then think about something you hear all the time and probably say, "A whole nother." What's nother? We have the word another, of course, but it's composed of an and other, or so we thought. Yet, when we slide whole into the middle, we don't say, "a whole other," we clip that n off of the an and stick it to other and create a new word, nother. For a long time, nobody was writing these sort of things down or putting them in a dictionary, but that's only because writing is more codified now than it was 1,000 years ago. So, when you see a weird word, remember that there might be a whole nother side to the story.

**Transcript**:
English, like all languages, is a messy business. You can be uncouth but not couth. You can be ruthless, but good luck trying to show somebody that you have ruth unless you happen to be married to someone named Ruth. It's bad to be unkempt but impossible to be kempt, or sheveled as opposed to disheveled. There are other things that make no more sense than those but that seem normal now because the sands of time have buried where they came from. For example, did you ever wonder why a nickname for Edward is Ned? Where'd the N come from? It's the same with Nellie for Ellen. Afterall, if someone's name is Ethan, we don't nickname him Nethan, nor do we call our favorite Maria, Nmaria. In fact, if anyone did, our primary urge would be to either scold them or gently hide them away until the company had departed. All these nicknames trace back to a mistake, although, a perfectly understandable one. In fact, even the word nickname is weird. What's so "nick" about a nickname? Is it that it's a name that has a nick in it? Let's face it, not likely. Actually, in Old English, the word was ekename, and eke meant also or other. You can see eke still used in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in a sentence like, "Whan Zephyrus eek with his sweete breeth," which meant, "When Zephyr also with his sweet breath." Ekename meant "also name." What happened was that when people said, "an ekename," it could sound like they were saying, "a nekename," and after a while, so many people were hearing it that way that they started saying, "That's my nickname," instead of, "That's my ekename." Now, the word had a stray n at the front that started as a mistake, but from now on was what the word really was. It was rather as if you had gum on the bottom of your shoe and stepped on a leaf, dragged that leaf along for the rest of your life, were buried wearing that shoe and went to heaven in it to spend eternity wedded to that stray, worn-out leaf. Ekename picked up an n and never let it go. The same thing happened with other words. Old English speakers cut otches into wood. But after centuries of being asked to cut an otch into something, it was easy to think you were cutting a notch instead, and pretty soon you were. In a world where almost no one could read, it was easier for what people heard to become, after awhile, what it started to actually be. Here's where the Ned-style nicknames come in. Old English was more like German than our English is now, and just as in German, my is mein, in Old English, my was meen. You would say meen book, actually boke in Old English, or meen cat. And just as today, we might refer to our child as my Dahlia or my Laura, in Old English, they would say, "Meen Ed". That is mein Ed, mein Ellie. You see where this is going.

**Transcript**:
In 1977, the physicist Edward Purcell calculated that if you push
a bacteria and then let go, it will stop in about
a millionth of a second. In that time, it will have traveled less
than the width of a single atom. The same holds true for a sperm
and many other microbes. It all has to do with being really small. Microscopic creatures inhabit
a world alien to us, where making it through an inch of water
is an incredible endeavor. But why does size matter
so much for a swimmer? What makes the world of a sperm
so fundamentally different from that of a sperm whale? To find out, we need to dive
into the physics of fluids. Here's a way to think about it. Imagine you are swimming in a pool. It's you and a whole bunch
of water molecules. Water molecules outnumber you
a thousand trillion trillion to one. So, pushing past them
with your gigantic body is easy, but if you were really small, say you were about the size
of a water molecule, all of a sudden, it's like you're swimming in a pool of people. Rather than simply swishing by
all the teeny, tiny molecules, now every single water molecule is like another person
you have to push past to get anywhere. In 1883, the physicist Osborne Reynolds figured out that there is
one simple number that can predict how a fluid will behave. It's called the Reynolds number, and it depends on simple properties
like the size of the swimmer, its speed, the density of the fluid, and the stickiness,
or the viscosity, of the fluid. What this means is that creatures
of very different sizes inhabit vastly different worlds. For example, because of its huge size, a sperm whale inhabits
the large Reynolds number world. If it flaps its tail once, it can coast ahead
for an incredible distance. Meanwhile, sperm live
in a low Reynolds number world. If a sperm were to stop flapping its tail, it wouldn't even coast past a single atom. To imagine what it would
feel like to be a sperm, you need to bring yourself down
to its Reynolds number. Picture yourself in a tub of molasses
with your arms moving about as slow as the minute
hand of a clock, and you'd have a pretty good idea
of what a sperm is up against. So, how do microbes
manage to get anywhere? Well, many don't bother swimming at all. They just let the food drift to them. This is somewhat like a lazy cow that waits for the grass
under its mouth to grow back. But many microbes do swim, and this is where those
incredible adaptations come in. One trick they can use
is to deform the shape of their paddle. By cleverly flexing their paddle to create more drag on the power stroke
than on the recovery stroke, single-celled organisms like paramecia manage to inch their way
through the crowd of water molecules. But there's an even more
ingenious solution arrived at by bacteria and sperm. Instead of wagging
their paddles back and forth, they wind them like a cork screw. Just as a cork screw on a wine bottle converts winding motion
into forward motion, these tiny creatures
spin their helical tails to push themselves forward in a world where water
feels as thick as cork. Other strategies are even stranger. Some bacteria take Batman's approach. They use grappling hooks
to pull themselves along. They can even use this grappling hook like a sling shot
and fling themselves forward. Others use chemical engineering. H. pylori lives only
in the slimy, acidic mucus inside our stomachs. It releases a chemical
that thins out the surrounding mucus, allowing it to glide through slime. Maybe it's no surprise that these guys are also responsible
for stomach ulcers. So, when you look really closely
at our bodies and the world around us, you can see all sorts of tiny creatures finding clever ways to get around
in a sticky situation. Without these adaptations,
bacteria would never find their hosts, and sperms would never
make it to their eggs, which means you would never
get stomach ulcers, but you would also never be born
in the first place. (Pop)

**Transcript**:
In 1977, the physicist Edward Purcell calculated that if you push
a bacteria and then let go, it will stop in about
a millionth of a second. In that time, it will have traveled less
than the width of a single atom. The same holds true for a sperm
and many other microbes. It all has to do with being really small. Microscopic creatures inhabit
a world alien to us, where making it through an inch of water
is an incredible endeavor. But why does size matter
so much for a swimmer? What makes the world of a sperm
so fundamentally different from that of a sperm whale? To find out, we need to dive
into the physics of fluids. Here's a way to think about it. Imagine you are swimming in a pool. It's you and a whole bunch
of water molecules. Water molecules outnumber you
a thousand trillion trillion to one. So, pushing past them
with your gigantic body is easy, but if you were really small, say you were about the size
of a water molecule, all of a sudden, it's like you're swimming in a pool of people. Rather than simply swishing by
all the teeny, tiny molecules, now every single water molecule is like another person
you have to push past to get anywhere. In 1883, the physicist Osborne Reynolds figured out that there is
one simple number that can predict how a fluid will behave. It's called the Reynolds number, and it depends on simple properties
like the size of the swimmer, its speed, the density of the fluid, and the stickiness,
or the viscosity, of the fluid. What this means is that creatures
of very different sizes inhabit vastly different worlds. For example, because of its huge size, a sperm whale inhabits
the large Reynolds number world. If it flaps its tail once, it can coast ahead
for an incredible distance. Meanwhile, sperm live
in a low Reynolds number world. If a sperm were to stop flapping its tail, it wouldn't even coast past a single atom. To imagine what it would
feel like to be a sperm, you need to bring yourself down
to its Reynolds number. Picture yourself in a tub of molasses
with your arms moving about as slow as the minute
hand of a clock, and you'd have a pretty good idea
of what a sperm is up against. So, how do microbes
manage to get anywhere? Well, many don't bother swimming at all. They just let the food drift to them. This is somewhat like a lazy cow that waits for the grass
under its mouth to grow back. But many microbes do swim, and this is where those
incredible adaptations come in. One trick they can use
is to deform the shape of their paddle. By cleverly flexing their paddle to create more drag on the power stroke
than on the recovery stroke, single-celled organisms like paramecia manage to inch their way
through the crowd of water molecules. But there's an even more
ingenious solution arrived at by bacteria and sperm. Instead of wagging
their paddles back and forth, they wind them like a cork screw. Just as a cork screw on a wine bottle converts winding motion
into forward motion, these tiny creatures
spin their helical tails to push themselves forward in a world where water
feels as thick as cork. Other strategies are even stranger. Some bacteria take Batman's approach. They use grappling hooks
to pull themselves along. They can even use this grappling hook like a sling shot
and fling themselves forward. Others use chemical engineering. H. pylori lives only
in the slimy, acidic mucus inside our stomachs. It releases a chemical
that thins out the surrounding mucus, allowing it to glide through slime. Maybe it's no surprise that these guys are also responsible
for stomach ulcers. So, when you look really closely
at our bodies and the world around us, you can see all sorts of tiny creatures finding clever ways to get around
in a sticky situation. Without these adaptations,
bacteria would never find their hosts, and sperms would never
make it to their eggs, which means you would never
get stomach ulcers, but you would also never be born
in the first place. (Pop)

**Transcript**:
what I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea and in particular I want to talk about the design of diarrhea and it's and when evolutionary biologists talk about design they are they really mean designed by natural selection and that brings me to the title of the talk using evolution to design disease organisms intelligently and I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this yeah but I'm not just doing this to be cute I really think that the subtitle explains what somebody like me is sort of a Darwin wannabe how they are to look at one's role in sort of coming into this field of Health Sciences in medicine it's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists you actually see a great potential but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf and and may actually be very resistant to try to resistant when one tries to introduce ideas so all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions one is it why are some disease organisms more harmful in a very closely related question which is how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answered the first question how can we make the harmful organisms more mild and I'm really talking to begin with as I said about diarrheal disease organisms and the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease is to think about the problem from a germs point of view germ side view and in particular to think about a fundamental idea which I think makes sense out of tremendous amount of variation in the variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms and that idea is that from the germs my point of view disease organisms have to get from one host to another and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host but not always sometimes you get disease organisms that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission and when you have that then evolutionary soup theory tells us that natural selection favor the more exploitative more predator like organisms so natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility then we expect that the winners the competition will be the milder organisms so if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active natural selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own reproductive success but if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen then it's the benign ones that are tend to be the winners so I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases sterile disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways they can be transmitted from person person contact person to food then to person contact when somebody eats contaminated food or they can be transmitted through the water and when they're transmitted through the water unlike the first two modes of transmission these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission a person can be sick in bed and still infect tens even hundreds of other individuals to sort of illustrate that this diagram emphasizes that if you got a sick person in bed somebody is going to be taking out the contaminated materials they're going to wash those contaminated materials and then the water may move into sources of drinking water people will come into the those places where you've got contaminated drinking water bring things back to the family may drink right at that point the whole point is that a person who can't move can still infect many other individuals and so the theory tells us that when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water we expect them to be more predator like more harmful and you can test these ideas so one way you can test you should look at all diarrhea bacteria and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water tend to be more harmful and the answer is yep they are and I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs but the main point here is is that the lot of them here I can tell the main point here is that those data points are show a very strong positive association between the degree to which the disease organism is transmitted by water and how harmful they are how how much death they caused per untreated infection so this suggests we're on the right track but this to me suggests that we really need to ask some additional questions remember the second question that I raised in the outset was how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild now this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of that graph but it doesn't tell you how long I mean if if this would require thousands of years then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens but if it could occur in just a few years then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control in other words we we just suggest that we could domesticate these organisms we could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us and so as I was thinking about this I focused on this organism which is the alt or bio type of the organism called Vibrio cholerae and that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera and the reason I thought this is a really great organism look at is that we understand why it's so harmful it's harmful because it produces a toxin and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract it causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen the the internal chamber of our intestine and then that fluid goes on when we can which is out the other end and it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the vibrios so what happens if you've got an organism produces a lot of toxin after a few days of infection you end up having you have to fecal material really isn't it's so disgusting as we might imagine it's sort of cloudy water and if you took a drop of that water you might find a million diarrhea organisms if if the organism produced a lot of toxin you might find ten million or 100 known it didn't prove a lot of this toxin then you might find a smaller number so the the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission thereby allowing the organism only be transmitted by person-to-person contact or person food person contact both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission now I can think of some of some possible experiments one would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism something a lot of toxins something produced a little and take those strains and spew them out in different countries some countries that might have clean water supplies they so you can't get waterborne transmission you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there other countries in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness right there's a little ethical problem in this experiment yeah I hope I was I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least that makes me worried a little bit but anyhow the laughter can makes me feel a little bit better and this ethical problems a big problem just to emphasize this this is what we're really talking about here's a girl's almost dead she got rehydration therapy she's being cooked up within a few days she was looking like a completely different person so we don't want to run an experiment like that but interestingly just that thing happened in 1991 1991 this cholera organism got into Lima Peru and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas now I didn't have I don't know how that happened and I didn't have anything to do with that I promise you I don't think anybody knows but I'm not averse to to once that's happened to see whether or not the prediction that we would make that I did make before actually holds up did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile which has some of the most well protected water supplies in Latin America and did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador which has some of the least well protected and Peru's got something sort of in-between and so with funding from those at Krueger Foundation I got a lot of strains from these different countries and I met we measure their toxin production in the lab and we found that in Chile within two months of the invasion of Peru you had strains entering Chile and when you look at those strains in the very upper left hand side of this graph you see a lot of variation in their toxin production each dot corresponds to an isolate from a different person a lot of variation on which natural selection act can act but the interesting point is if you look over the 1990s within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild they evolved to produce less toxin and to just give you a sense of how important this might be if we look in 1995 we find that there's only one case of caller on average reported from Chile every two years so it's controlled apology that's not much we have in America a cholera that's acquired endemically and we don't think we've got a problem here they didn't they solved the problem in Chile but before we get too confident we've got to look at some of those other countries make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve towards mildness well improve it didn't and in Ecuador remember this is the place where there's the highest potential waterborne transmission it looked like it got more harmful in every case there's a lot of variation but something about the environment that people are living in and I think that the only realistic explanation is that it's the the degree of waterborne transmission favored the harmful strains in one place in mild strains in another so this is very encouraging it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow if he had enough money could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck it would make these organisms evolve to mildness so that even though people might be getting infected they could be infected of mild strains that wouldn't be causing severe disease but there's another really interesting aspect of this and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence evolution of harmfulness then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance and the idea is very simple if you've got a harmful organism a high proportion the people are going to be symptomatic high proportions people going to be going to get antibiotics you got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance so you get increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance and once you get increased antibiotic resistance the antibiotics are knocking out the harmful strains anymore so you've got a higher level of Maryland so you get this vicious cycle the goal is to turn this around if you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance so we can go to the same countries and look and see did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem if we look in the beginning of 1990s we see again a lot of variation in this case on the y-axis we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity and I won't go into that but we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity and Chile pruin active our know trend across the years but if we look at the end of the 1990s just half a decade later we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem antibiotic sensitivity was going down and in Chile you still had antibiotic sensitivity so it looks like Chile dodged two bullets they got the organism involved the mildness and they got no development of antibiotic resistance now these ideas should apply across the board as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolve to virulence and I want to give you just one more example because we've talked a little bit about malaria in the example I want to deal with this or the idea I wanted to deal with a question is what can we do to try to get the malaria organism evolve to mildness now malaria is transmitted by mosquito and normally if you're infected with malaria and you're feeling sick it makes it even easier for the mosquito to to bite you and you can show just by looking at data and literature that vector borne diseases are more harmful than non vector borne diseases but I think there's a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this in the case of waterborne transmission we'd like to clean up the water supplies see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness in the case of malaria what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses and and the logic is a little more subtle here if your mosquito-proof houses when people get sick they're sitting in bed or the skete above hospitals they're sitting in a hospital bed and the mosquitoes can't get to them so if you're a harmful variant in a place where you've got mosquito proof housing then you're a loser the only pathogen to get transmitted are the ones that are detecting people to feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites so if you were to mosquito-proof houses you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness and there's a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggest that we really should go ahead and do this and that experiment was done in northern Alabama just to give you a little perspective and this I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States which is right there in Louisville Kentucky and this really cool experiment was done about 200 miles south of there in northern Alabama by the Tennessee Valley Authority they had dammed up the Tennessee River that caused the water to back up these electric hydroelectric power and when you get stagnant water you got mosquitoes they found in the in the late 30s ten years after they'd made these dams that the people in northern Alabama were infected with malaria about a third of the third to half of them are infected with malaria guys it shows the positions of some of these dams okay so the Tennessee Valley Authority was a little bit of a bind there wasn't DDT there wasn't chloric winds what did they do well they decided a mosquito poof every house northern Alabama so they did they divided northern Alabama in 11 zones and within three years about $100 per house they mesquite approved every house and these are the data every row across here represents one of those 11 zones and the asterisks represent the time at which the mosquito proofing was complete and so what you can see is that just the mosquito proofing housing and nothing else caused the eradication of malaria and this was incidentally published in 1949 in the leading textbook of malaria called Boyd's malaria ology but almost no malaria experts even though it exists this is important because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses now I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places like you know sub tear and just as you get into the malaria zone it's up to in Africa but as you move to really intense biting right areas like Nigeria you're probably not certainly not going to Radek eight but that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness so to me it's just an experiment that's waiting to happen if it confirms the prediction then we should be you should have a very powerful tool in a way much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at because most of what's being done today is to rely on things like anti malarial drugs and we know that although it's great to make those anti malarial drugs available in really low cost and high high frequency we know that with when you make no highly available you're going to get resistance to those drugs and so it's a short-term solution this is this long-term solution what I'm suggesting here is we could get evolution working in the direction we want it to go rather than always having to battle evolution is a problem that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen for example with anti malarial drugs so this table I've given just to emphasize that I've only talked about two examples but as I said earlier this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases and it ought to because when we're dealing with infectious diseases we're dealing with living systems we're dealing with living we're dealing with systems that evolve and so if you do something those systems they're going to evolve one way or other and all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve so that we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go so I don't really have time to talk about those things but I did want to put them up there just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that were confronted with and and this this links up with a lot of the other ideas have been talked about so for example earlier today we you know there's a discussion of how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV what this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how to lower it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area it may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more faithful departments and so on but the key thing is to figure out how to lower it because if we lower it we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus and the data really do support this that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness and that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts so the other thing I really like about this besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease is that often the kinds of interventions that you want to that it indicates should be done are the kind of Vengeance interventions that people want anyhow but people just haven't been able to justify the cost so this is the kind of thing I'm talking about if we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water then I think that we can say let's push the effort into that aspect of the control so that we can actually solve the problem even though if you just look at the frequency of infection you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply you know oh in there and thank you very much you

what I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea and in particular I want to talk about the design of diarrhea and it's and when evolutionary biologists talk about design they are they really mean designed by natural selection and that brings me to the title of the talk using evolution to design disease organisms intelligently and I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this yeah but I'm not just doing this to be cute I really think that the subtitle explains what somebody like me is sort of a Darwin wannabe how they are to look at one's role in sort of coming into this field of Health Sciences in medicine it's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists you actually see a great potential but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf and and may actually be very resistant to try to resistant when one tries to introduce ideas so all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions one is it why are some disease organisms more harmful in a very closely related question which is how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answered the first question how can we make the harmful organisms more mild and I'm really talking to begin with as I said about diarrheal disease organisms and the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease is to think about the problem from a germs point of view germ side view and in particular to think about a fundamental idea which I think makes sense out of tremendous amount of variation in the variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms and that idea is that from the germs my point of view disease organisms have to get from one host to another and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host but not always sometimes you get disease organisms that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission and when you have that then evolutionary soup theory tells us that natural selection favor the more exploitative more predator like organisms so natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility then we expect that the winners the competition will be the milder organisms so if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active natural selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own reproductive success but if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen then it's the benign ones that are tend to be the winners so I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases sterile disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways they can be transmitted from person person contact person to food then to person contact when somebody eats contaminated food or they can be transmitted through the water and when they're transmitted through the water unlike the first two modes of transmission these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission a person can be sick in bed and still infect tens even hundreds of other individuals to sort of illustrate that this diagram emphasizes that if you got a sick person in bed somebody is going to be taking out the contaminated materials they're going to wash those contaminated materials and then the water may move into sources of drinking water people will come into the those places where you've got contaminated drinking water bring things back to the family may drink right at that point the whole point is that a person who can't move can still infect many other individuals and so the theory tells us that when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water we expect them to be more predator like more harmful and you can test these ideas so one way you can test you should look at all diarrhea bacteria and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water tend to be more harmful and the answer is yep they are and I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs but the main point here is is that the lot of them here I can tell the main point here is that those data points are show a very strong positive association between the degree to which the disease organism is transmitted by water and how harmful they are how how much death they caused per untreated infection so this suggests we're on the right track but this to me suggests that we really need to ask some additional questions remember the second question that I raised in the outset was how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild now this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of that graph but it doesn't tell you how long I mean if if this would require thousands of years then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens but if it could occur in just a few years then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control in other words we we just suggest that we could domesticate these organisms we could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us and so as I was thinking about this I focused on this organism which is the alt or bio type of the organism called Vibrio cholerae and that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera and the reason I thought this is a really great organism look at is that we understand why it's so harmful it's harmful because it produces a toxin and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract it causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen the the internal chamber of our intestine and then that fluid goes on when we can which is out the other end and it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the vibrios so what happens if you've got an organism produces a lot of toxin after a few days of infection you end up having you have to fecal material really isn't it's so disgusting as we might imagine it's sort of cloudy water and if you took a drop of that water you might find a million diarrhea organisms if if the organism produced a lot of toxin you might find ten million or 100 known it didn't prove a lot of this toxin then you might find a smaller number so the the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission thereby allowing the organism only be transmitted by person-to-person contact or person food person contact both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission now I can think of some of some possible experiments one would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism something a lot of toxins something produced a little and take those strains and spew them out in different countries some countries that might have clean water supplies they so you can't get waterborne transmission you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there other countries in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness right there's a little ethical problem in this experiment yeah I hope I was I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least that makes me worried a little bit but anyhow the laughter can makes me feel a little bit better and this ethical problems a big problem just to emphasize this this is what we're really talking about here's a girl's almost dead she got rehydration therapy she's being cooked up within a few days she was looking like a completely different person so we don't want to run an experiment like that but interestingly just that thing happened in 1991 1991 this cholera organism got into Lima Peru and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas now I didn't have I don't know how that happened and I didn't have anything to do with that I promise you I don't think anybody knows but I'm not averse to to once that's happened to see whether or not the prediction that we would make that I did make before actually holds up did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile which has some of the most well protected water supplies in Latin America and did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador which has some of the least well protected and Peru's got something sort of in-between and so with funding from those at Krueger Foundation I got a lot of strains from these different countries and I met we measure their toxin production in the lab and we found that in Chile within two months of the invasion of Peru you had strains entering Chile and when you look at those strains in the very upper left hand side of this graph you see a lot of variation in their toxin production each dot corresponds to an isolate from a different person a lot of variation on which natural selection act can act but the interesting point is if you look over the 1990s within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild they evolved to produce less toxin and to just give you a sense of how important this might be if we look in 1995 we find that there's only one case of caller on average reported from Chile every two years so it's controlled apology that's not much we have in America a cholera that's acquired endemically and we don't think we've got a problem here they didn't they solved the problem in Chile but before we get too confident we've got to look at some of those other countries make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve towards mildness well improve it didn't and in Ecuador remember this is the place where there's the highest potential waterborne transmission it looked like it got more harmful in every case there's a lot of variation but something about the environment that people are living in and I think that the only realistic explanation is that it's the the degree of waterborne transmission favored the harmful strains in one place in mild strains in another so this is very encouraging it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow if he had enough money could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck it would make these organisms evolve to mildness so that even though people might be getting infected they could be infected of mild strains that wouldn't be causing severe disease but there's another really interesting aspect of this and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence evolution of harmfulness then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance and the idea is very simple if you've got a harmful organism a high proportion the people are going to be symptomatic high proportions people going to be going to get antibiotics you got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance so you get increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance and once you get increased antibiotic resistance the antibiotics are knocking out the harmful strains anymore so you've got a higher level of Maryland so you get this vicious cycle the goal is to turn this around if you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance so we can go to the same countries and look and see did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem if we look in the beginning of 1990s we see again a lot of variation in this case on the y-axis we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity and I won't go into that but we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity and Chile pruin active our know trend across the years but if we look at the end of the 1990s just half a decade later we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem antibiotic sensitivity was going down and in Chile you still had antibiotic sensitivity so it looks like Chile dodged two bullets they got the organism involved the mildness and they got no development of antibiotic resistance now these ideas should apply across the board as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolve to virulence and I want to give you just one more example because we've talked a little bit about malaria in the example I want to deal with this or the idea I wanted to deal with a question is what can we do to try to get the malaria organism evolve to mildness now malaria is transmitted by mosquito and normally if you're

we'd like to clean up the water supplies see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness in the case of malaria what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses and and the logic is a little more subtle here if your mosquito-proof houses when people get sick they're sitting in bed or the skete above hospitals they're sitting in a hospital bed and the mosquitoes can't get to them so if you're a harmful variant in a place where you've got mosquito proof housing then you're a loser the only pathogen to get transmitted are the ones that are detecting people to feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites so if you were to mosquito-proof houses you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness and there's a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggest that we really should go ahead and do this and that experiment was done in northern Alabama just to give you a little perspective and this I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States which is right there in Louisville Kentucky and this really cool experiment was done about 200 miles south of there in northern Alabama by the Tennessee Valley Authority they had dammed up the Tennessee River that caused the water to back up these electric hydroelectric power and when you get stagnant water you got mosquitoes they found in the in the late 30s ten years after they'd made these dams that the people in northern Alabama were infected with malaria about a third of the third to half of them are infected with malaria guys it shows the positions of some of these dams okay so the Tennessee Valley Authority was a little bit of a bind there wasn't DDT there wasn't chloric winds what did they do well they decided a mosquito poof every house northern

because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses now I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places like you know sub tear and just as you get into the malaria zone it's up to in Africa but as you move to really intense biting right areas like Nigeria you're probably not certainly not going to Radek eight but that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness so to me it's just an experiment that's waiting to happen if it confirms the prediction then we should be you should have a very powerful tool in a way much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at because most of what's being done today is to rely on things like anti malarial drugs and we know that although it's great to make those anti malarial drugs available in really low cost and high high frequency we know that with when you make no highly available you're going to get resistance to those drugs and so it's a short-term solution this is this long-term solution what I'm suggesting here is we could get evolution working in the direction we want it to go rather than always having to battle evolution is a problem that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen for example with anti malarial drugs so this table I've given just to emphasize that I've only talked about two examples but as I said earlier

need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go so I don't really have time to talk about those things but I did want to put them up there just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that were confronted with and and this this links up with a lot of the other ideas have been talked about so for example earlier today we you know there's a discussion of how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV what this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how to lower it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area it may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more faithful departments and so on but the key thing is to figure out how to lower it because if we lower it we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus and the data really do support this that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness and that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts so the other thing I really like about this besides the

interventions that people want anyhow but people just haven't been able to justify the cost so this is the kind of thing I'm talking about if we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water then I think that we can say let's push the effort into that aspect of the control so that we can actually solve the problem even though if you just look at the frequency of infection you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply you know oh in there and thank you very much you

[Music] [Applause] there is nothing bigger older than the universe the questions I would like to talk about our one where did we come from how did the universe come into being are we alone in the universe is there alien life out there what is the future of the human race up until the 1920s everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time then it was discovered that the universe was expanding distant galaxies were moving away from us this meant they must have been closer together in the past if we extrapolate back we find they must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago this was the Big Bang the beginning of the universe but was there anything before the Big Bang if not what created a universe why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts first there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determine the evolution of the universe given its state over all space at one time one second there was no question of the initial state of the universe we have made good progress on the first part and now have a knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions but until recently we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe however this division into laws of evolution an initial ditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct under extreme conditions general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space this removes a distinction between time and space and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state the universe can spontaneously created self out of nothing moreover we can calculate the probability that the universe is created in different states these predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the Cosmic Microwave Background which is an imprint of the very early universe we think we have solved the mystery of creation maybe we should patent the universe encourage everyone royalties for their existence I now turned on the second big question are we alone or is there other life in the universe we believe that life arose spontaneously on the earth so it must be possible for life to appear another suitable planets of which there seemed to be a large number in the galaxy but we don't know how life first appeared we have two pieces of observational evidence and the probability of life appearing the first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago the earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years so life appeared on earth within half a billion years of it being possible which is short compared to the ten billion year lifetime of a planet of earth type the suggests that the probability of life appearing is recently high if it was very low one would have expected it to take most of the 10 billion years available on the other hand we don't seem to have been visited by aliens I am discounting reports of UFOs why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos if there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far furthermore despite an extensive search by the SETI project we have heard any alien television quiz shows this probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet this brings me to the last of the big questions the future of the human race if we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy we should make sure we survive and continue but we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history our population in our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill but our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were a survival advantage in the past it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years let alone the next thousand or million our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain in red lurking on planet earth but to spread out into space the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years but if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years our futures in space that is why I'm in favor of manned or should I say person'd space flight all my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap indeed it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue a quest for knowledge the ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe and we are making good progress thank you for listening professor if you had to guess either way do you now believe that it is more likely than not but we are alone in the Milky Way as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher this this answer took seven minutes and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this

However, I must note that the generated MCQ does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent. A better match would be a generated MCQ that asks about when people thought the universe was static, with options that include the 1920s.

Here's an example of a better match:

**Generated MCQ**:

[Music] [Applause] there is nothing bigger older than the universe the questions I would like to talk about our one where did we come from how did the universe come into being are we alone in the universe is there alien life out there what is the future of the human race up until the 1920s everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time then it was discovered that the universe was expanding distant galaxies were moving away from us this meant they must have been closer together in the past if we extrapolate back we find they must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago this was the Big Bang the beginning of the universe but was there anything before the Big Bang if not what created a universe why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts first there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determine the evolution of the universe given its state over all space at one time one second there was no question of the initial state of the universe we have made good progress on the first part and now have a knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions but until recently we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe however this division into laws of evolution an initial ditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct under extreme conditions general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space this removes a distinction between time and space and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state the universe can spontaneously created self out of nothing moreover we can calculate the probability that the universe is created in different states these predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the Cosmic Microwave Background which is an imprint of the very early universe we think we have solved the mystery of creation maybe we should patent the universe encourage everyone royalties for their existence I now turned on the second big question are we alone or is there other life in the universe we believe that life arose spontaneously on the earth so it must be possible for life to appear another suitable planets of which there seemed to be a large number in the galaxy but we don't know how life first appeared we have two pieces of observational evidence and the probability of life appearing the first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago the earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years so life appeared on earth within half a billion years of it being possible which is short compared to the ten billion year lifetime of a planet of earth type the suggests that the probability of life appearing is recently high if it was very low one would have expected it to take most of the 10 billion years available on the other hand we don't seem to have been visited by aliens I am discounting reports of UFOs why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos if there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far furthermore despite an extensive search by the SETI project we have heard any alien television quiz shows this probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet this brings me to the last of the big questions the future of the human race if we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy we should make sure we survive and continue but we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history our population in our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill but our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were a survival advantage in the past it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years let alone the next thousand or million our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain in red lurking on planet earth but to spread out into space the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years but if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years our futures in space that is why I'm in favor of manned or should I say person'd space flight all my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap indeed it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue a quest for knowledge the ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe and we are making good progress thank you for listening professor if you had to guess either way do you now believe that it is more likely than not but we are alone in the Milky Way as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher this this answer took seven minutes and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for Ted I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years otherwise we would have heard radio waves the alternative is that civilizations don't last very long but destroyed themselves professor Hawking thank you for that answer we will take it as a salutary warning I think for the rest of our conference this week professor we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today thank you very much indeed [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
Each spring, nature lovers eagerly greet the signs that winter is finally coming to an end. As the days grow warmer, the flowers and trees start to bloom, and the world comes alive with the melodious call of birds in search of a new mate. But where have these enchanting sounds been hiding all winter? For almost 200 species of song birds, their winters have been spent down in the tropical climates of Central and South America. While this may sound ideal, it involves one of the most perilous journeys known in the entire animal kingdom. This journey is called migration, and for song birds, this can involve travelling somewhere between a few hundred to almost 7,000 miles in a period of several weeks to four months. Birds spend weeks preparing for the intense journey by gorging on large quantities of food, sometimes doubling their weight prior to departure. While flying, birds can lose almost one percent of their body weight an hour, so packing on the pounds is crucial to their survival. However, more than the physical stress, migrating birds are now facing a new source of hardship: landscape change. Just imagine you're the one getting ready to take a trip. You've packed the car with everything you think you need, fueled up the tank, eaten a huge breakfast, and hit the road. You've taken this journey before. You know all your favorite rest stops and little back-alley diners to grab a bite. Everything is planned out. But just as your fuel gauge starts dipping into the red zone, you pass by what should have been a gas station, except it's closed. "Not a problem," you think, "The next one can't be too far away." But then that next station never appears. Unfortunately, as you continue on your route, the reality of the situation starts to set in. More and more stations are closed or just erased from your map. All of a sudden, your routine trip has become a desperate search just to find somewhere safe to rest and refuel for the night. This scenario has become the reality for the majority of migrating song birds as human land development continues unchecked. Humans are altering important stop-over sites that birds have been using for generations. As migrators pass over the continent, they run a gauntlet of dangers, including pesticide ingestion in rural farmlands, habitat loss in suburban developments, as well as disorientation from light pollution, and even structure collision with tall, reflective glass buildings in cities. Of the estimated 20 billion individual birds that comprise the fall population, only about half will return to breed the following spring. Almost one billion of these deaths are attributed just to building collisions. With such astounding yearly losses, humans risk more than just the loss of the beautiful colors and songs of birds, they also play an important role in the ecosystem. Birds help with insect control, pollination, and disbursing seeds throughout the landscape. Without birds, the natural world would be a very different place. Although birds face an on-going threat from human land development, there are actions that we can all take to help. Many countries and local governements have already passed important laws that restrict the use of poisonous pesticides. By using more natural, plant-based products, we can maintain our farms and gardens without the dangerous side effects. In addition, as our global populations continue to grow and people need places to call home, green spaces can offer both bird habitat as well as a peaceful and natural place for us to enjoy. Small changes at home can also make a huge difference. By hanging up feeders and building bird houses in outdoor areas, we can provide much-needed food and safety during long migrations. Turning out lights in suburban and urban environments can also help birds that look for stars to navigate. With our help, these sky travellers can reach their destination safely, and hopefully keep returning year after year.

You know all your favorite rest stops and little back-alley diners to grab a bite. Everything is planned out. But just as your fuel gauge starts dipping into the red zone, you pass by what should have been a gas station, except it's closed. "Not a problem," you think, "The next one can't be too far away." But then that next station never appears. Unfortunately, as you continue on your route, the reality of the situation starts to set in. More and more stations are closed or just erased from your map. All of a sudden, your routine trip has become a desperate search just to find somewhere safe to rest and refuel for the night. This scenario has become the reality for the majority of migrating song birds as human land development continues unchecked. Humans are altering important stop-over sites that birds have been using for generations. As migrators pass over the continent, they run a gauntlet of dangers, including pesticide ingestion in rural farmlands, habitat loss in suburban developments, as well as disorientation from light pollution, and even structure collision with tall, reflective glass buildings in cities. Of the estimated 20 billion individual birds that comprise the fall population, only about half will return to breed the following spring. Almost one billion of these deaths are attributed just to building collisions. With such astounding yearly losses, humans risk more than just the loss of the beautiful colors and songs of birds, they also play an important role in the ecosystem. Birds help with insect control, pollination, and disbursing seeds throughout the landscape. Without birds, the natural world would be a very different place. Although birds face an on-going threat from human land development, there are actions that we can all take to help. Many countries and local governements have already passed important laws that restrict the use of poisonous pesticides. By using more natural, plant-based products, we can maintain our farms and gardens without the dangerous side effects. In addition, as our global populations continue to grow and people need places to call home, green spaces can offer both bird habitat as well as a peaceful and natural place for us to enjoy. Small changes at home can also make a huge difference. By hanging up feeders and building bird houses in outdoor areas, we can provide much-needed food and safety during long migrations. Turning out lights in suburban and urban environments can also help birds that look for stars to navigate. With our help, these sky travellers can reach their destination safely, and hopefully keep returning year after year.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever heard the sound of frogs calling at night? For hundreds of millions of years, this croaking lullaby has filled the nighttime air. But recent studies suggest that these frogs are in danger of playing their final note. Over the past few decades, amphibian populations have been rapidly disappearing worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's amphibian species are endanger of extinction, and over 100 species have already disappeared. But don't worry, there's still hope. Before we get into how to save the frogs, let's start by taking a look at why they're disappearing and why it's important to keep them around. Habitat destruction is the number one problem for frog populations around the world. There are seven billion humans on the planet, and we compete with frogs for habitat. We build cities, suburbs, and farms on top of frog habitat and chop forests and drain the wetlands that serve as home for numerous amphibian populations. Climate change alters precipitation levels, drying up ponds, streams, and cloud forests. As the Earth's human population continues to grow, so will the threats amphibians face. There are a variety of other factors contributing to the frogs' decline. Over-harvesting for the pet and food trade results in millions of frogs being taken out of the wild each year. Invasive species, such as non-native trout and crawfish, eat native frogs. Humans are facilitating the spread of infectious diseases by shipping over 100 million amphibians around the world each year for use as food, pets, bait, and in laboratories and zoos, with few regulations or quarantines. One of these diseases, chytridiomycosis, has driven stream-dwelling amphibian populations to extinction in Africa, Australia, Europe, and North, Central, and South America. On top of all these problems, we add hundreds of millions of kilograms of pesticides to our ecosystems each year. And these chemicals are easily absorbed through amphibians' permeable skin, causing immunosuppression, or a weakened immune system, and developmental deformities. Okay, so why are these little green guys worth keeping around? Frogs are important for a multitude of reasons. They're an integral part of the food web, eating flies, ticks, mosquitoes, and other disease vectors, thus, protecting us against malaria, dengue fever, and other illnesses. Tadpoles keep waterways clean by feeding on algae, reducing the demand on our community's filtration systems and keeping our cost of water low. Frogs serve as a source of food for birds, fish, snakes, dragonflies, and even monkeys. When frogs disappear, the food web is disturbed, and other animals can disappear as well. Amphibians are also extremely important in human medicine. Over ten percent of the Nobel prizes in physiology and medicine have gone to researchers whose work depended on amphibians. Some of the antimicrobial peptides on frog skin can kill HIV, some act as pain killers, and others serve as natural mosquito repellents. Many discoveries await us if we can save the frogs, but when a frog species disappears, so does any promise it holds for improving human health. Fortunately, there are lots of ways you can help, and the best place to start is by improving your ecological footprint and day-to-day actions. The next time you listen to that nighttime lullaby, don't think of it as just another background noise, hear it as a call for help, sung in perfect croaking harmony.

Nearly one-third of the world's amphibian species are endanger of extinction, and over 100 species have already disappeared. But don't worry, there's still hope. Before we get into how to save the frogs, let's start by taking a look at why they're disappearing and why it's important to keep them around. Habitat destruction is the number one problem for frog populations around the world. There are seven billion humans on the planet, and we compete with frogs for habitat. We build cities, suburbs, and farms on top of frog habitat and chop forests and drain the wetlands that serve as home for numerous amphibian populations. Climate change alters precipitation levels, drying up ponds, streams, and cloud forests. As the Earth's human population continues to grow, so will the threats amphibians face. There are a variety of other factors contributing to the frogs' decline. Over-harvesting for the pet and food trade results in millions of frogs being taken out of the wild each year. Invasive species, such as non-native trout and crawfish, eat native frogs. Humans are facilitating the spread of infectious diseases by shipping over 100 million amphibians around the world each year for use as food, pets, bait, and in laboratories and zoos, with few regulations or quarantines. One of these diseases, chytridiomycosis, has driven stream-dwelling amphibian populations to extinction in Africa, Australia, Europe, and North, Central, and South America. On top of all these problems, we add hundreds of millions of kilograms of pesticides to our ecosystems each year. And these chemicals are easily absorbed through amphibians' permeable skin, causing immunosuppression, or a weakened immune system, and developmental deformities. Okay, so why are these little green guys worth keeping around? Frogs are important for a multitude of reasons. They're an integral part of the food web, eating flies, ticks, mosquitoes, and other disease vectors, thus, protecting us against malaria, dengue fever, and other illnesses. Tadpoles keep waterways clean by feeding on algae, reducing the demand on our community's filtration systems and keeping our cost of water low. Frogs serve as a source of food for birds, fish, snakes, dragonflies, and even monkeys. When frogs disappear, the food web is disturbed, and other animals can disappear as well. Amphibians are also extremely important in human medicine. Over ten percent of the Nobel prizes in physiology and medicine have gone to researchers whose work depended on amphibians. Some of the antimicrobial peptides on frog skin can kill HIV, some act as pain killers, and others serve as natural mosquito repellents. Many discoveries await us if we can save the frogs, but when a frog species disappears, so does any promise it holds for improving human health. Fortunately, there are lots of ways you can help, and the best place to start is by improving your ecological footprint and day-to-day actions. The next time you listen to that nighttime lullaby, don't think of it as just another background noise, hear it as a call for help, sung in perfect croaking harmony.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] i'm a bug lover myself not from childhood by the way but rather late uh when i bachelored a major in zoology in tel aviv university i kind of fell in love with bugs and then within zoology i took the course of the discipline of entomology the science of insects and then i thought myself how can i be practical or or help in the science of entomology and then i moved to the world of plant protection plant protection from insects from bedbugs and then within plant protection i came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests so it's a whole discipline in plant protection that aiming at reduction of chemicals and biological pest control by the way or these good bugs that we are talking about they exist in the world for thousands and thousands of years for a long long time but only in the hundred and last hundred and twenty years people started or people knew more and more how to explore how to use this biological control phenomenon or in fact natural control phenomenon to their own needs because biological control phenomena you can see it in your backyard just take a magnifying glass you see what i have here that's a magnifier times 10 yeah times 10 you just open it you just twist leaves and you see a whole new world of by nude insects or little spiders of one millimeter one and a half two meter millimeters long and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones so this phenomenon of of natural control exists literally everywhere here in front of this building i'm sure just have a look at the plants so it's everywhere and we need to know how to exploit it well let us look just hand by hand and browse through just a few examples what is a pest what damage it actually inflicts on the plant and what is the natural enemy the biological control agent or the good bug that we are talking about in general i'm going to talk about insects and spiders or mites let us call them insects those six select organisms and spider or mites the eight lead organisms let's have a look at that here is a pest devastating pest a spider mite because it does a lot of webbing like a spider you see the mother in between and two daughters probably on the left and right and a single egg on the right hand side and then you see what kind of damage it can inflate on your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf and in the middle cotton leaf and on the left tomato leaf with these little stippling they can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking piercing and mouth parts of those spiders but here comes nature that provides us with a good spider this is a predatory mod just as small as the spider mite by the way one millimeter two millimeter long not more than that running quickly hunting chasing the spider mites and here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side just pierces such the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite and after five minutes this is what you see just typical dead corpse shriveled sucked out dead corpse of the spider mite and next to it two satiated individuals of predatory mice and mother on the left-hand side a young myth on the right hand side by the way a meal for them for 24 hours are about five individuals of the spider mites of the bad mites and or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites by the way they are hungry always and there is another example aphids by the way it's springtime now in israel when temperature rises sharply you can see those bad ones those aphids all over the plants in your hibiscus in your lantana on the young fresh foliage of the spring flush so-called by the way with aphids you have only females like amazon's females giving rise to females giving rise to other females no males at all parthenogenesis was so-called and they are very happy with that apparently and here you can see the damage those aphids secrete some sticky sugary liquid called honeydew and this just clogs the upper part of the plant you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of the black fungus mold which is covering it and here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp here we are not talking about the predator here we are talking about a parasite not a two-legged parasite but an eight-legged parasite of yours yeah this is a parasitic wasp again two meters long slender a very quick and sharp flyer and here you can see this parasite in action like in an acrobatic maneuver she stands vis-a-vis in front of the victim on the right-hand side bending his abdomen and inserting a single egg a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid by the way the effect tries to escape she kicks and and bites and secretes different liquids but nothing will happen in fact only the egg of the parasitoid will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid and after a few days depends on upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside and after and this is all natural this is all natural this is not fiction nothing at all again in your backyard in your backyard absolutely this is this is the end result this is the end result mummies m-u-m-y [Music] this is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside in fact a developing parenting toy that after a few minutes you see half way out the birth is almost complete you can see by the way different movies etc and it takes just a few minutes and if this is a female she will immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short this female can live only three to four days and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs that means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids and this is of course not the end of it there is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example again we'll start first with the quest the thrips by the way all these weird names huh i didn't bother you with the latinx of these creatures okay just the popular names but this is a nice slender very bad pest if you can see this sweet peppers this is not just an exotic or a metal sweet pepper this is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those three adults and here comes the natural enemy my note pirate bug my mood because it is rather small yeah you can see the adult black and two young ones and again in action this adult pierces the trips sucking it within just several minutes just going to the other prey continuing all over the place and if we spread those my root pirate bugs the good ones for example in a sweet pepper plot they go to the flowers and look this flower is flooded with predatory bugs with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones the trips so this is a very positive situation by the way no harm to the developing fruit no heart to the fruit set everything is justified under these circumstances but again the question is here you saw them on a one-to-one basis the past the natural enemy what we do is actually this in the northeast israel in kibbutz deliao there is a facility that mass produces those natural enemies in other words what we do there we amplify we amplify the natural control of the biological control phenomenon and in 30 000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses there we are mass producing those predatory mines those mild pirate bugs those parasitic wasps etc etc many different parts by the way they have a very nice landscape you see the jordanian mountains on one hand and they do jordan valley on the other hand and a good mild winter and a nice hot summer which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures by the way mass production it is not genetic manipulation there are no gmos genetically modified organisms whatsoever we take them from nature and the only thing that we do we give them the optimal conditions under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms in order to proliferate multiply and reproduce and that's what we get in fact you see under a microscope you see on the upper left corner you see the single predatory mite and this is a whole bunch of predatory mites you see this apple you see this one i have one gram of those predatory mites one grams 80 000 individuals 80 000 individuals are good enough to control one acre four thousand square meters of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year and we can produce from this believe you me several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis so this is what they call amplification of the phenomenon and no we do we do not disrupt the balance on the contrary because we bring it to agricultural plot where the balance or was already disrupted by the chemicals here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals that's the whole idea and what is the impact in this table you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs for example in israel where we employ more than one thousand hectares ten thousand donuts in israeli terms of biological pest-controlling sweet pepper under protection seventy-five percent of the pesticides were actually reduced and the israelis strawberries even more 80 percent of the pesticide especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries so the impact is very strong and there goes the question especially if you ask growers agriculturalists why biological control why good bugs by the way the number of answers you get equals to the number of people you ask but if we go for example to this place southeast israel the arava valley along the great rift valley where the really top-notch the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located especially under greenhouse conditions or under screen house conditions if you drive all the way to a lot you see this just in the middle of the desert and if you zoom in you can definitely watch this grandparents with their grandchildren distribute the natural enemies the good bugs instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applied chemicals so safety with respect to the application this is number one answer that we get from growers why biological control number two many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals just in our case that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics it's the same and it can happen very quickly fortunately in the biological control or in the natural control resistance is extremely rare it hardly happens because this is evolution this is the natural issue unlike resistance which happens in the case of chemicals and thirdly public demand public demand the more the public the public demands reduction of chemicals more growers become aware of the fact they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control with biological control even here there is another grower you see very interested in the bugs the bad ones and the good ones wearing this magnifier already on her head just walking safely in her crop finally i want to get to actually to my vision or in fact my dream because you see this is the reality have a look at the gap if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide is 250 million dollars and look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world i think it's times 100 or something like that 25 billion so there is a huge gap to bridge so actually how can we do it how can we bridge or let's say never disgrace this gap in the course of the years first of all we need to find more robust good and reliable biological solutions more good bugs that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field secondly to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agriculture of fresh produce and thirdly also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry and this gap really narrows step by step it does never so i think my last slide is all we are saying we can actually see it give nature a chance so i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners and implementers in israel and abroad really give nature a chance thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] i'm a bug lover myself not from childhood by the way but rather late uh when i bachelored a major in zoology in tel aviv university i kind of fell in love with bugs and then within zoology i took the course of the discipline of entomology the science of insects and then i thought myself how can i be practical or or help in the science of entomology and then i moved to the world of plant protection plant protection from insects from bedbugs and then within plant protection i came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests so it's a whole discipline in plant protection that aiming at reduction of chemicals and biological pest control by the way or these good bugs that we are talking about they exist in the world for thousands and thousands of years for a long long time but only in the hundred and last hundred and twenty years people started or people knew more and more how to explore how to use this biological control phenomenon or in fact natural control phenomenon to their own needs because biological control phenomena you can see it in your backyard just take a magnifying glass you see what i have here that's a magnifier times 10 yeah times 10 you just open it you just twist leaves and you see a whole new world of by nude insects or little spiders of one millimeter one and a half two meter millimeters long and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones so this phenomenon of of natural control exists literally everywhere here in front of this building i'm sure just have a look at the plants so it's everywhere and we need to know how to exploit it well let us look just hand by hand and browse through just a few examples what is a pest what damage it actually inflicts on the plant and what is the natural enemy the biological control agent or the good bug that we are talking about in general i'm going to talk about insects and spiders or mites let us call them insects those six select organisms and spider or mites the eight lead organisms let's have a look at that here is a pest devastating pest a spider mite because it does a lot of webbing like a spider you see the mother in between and two daughters probably on the left and right and a single egg on the right hand side and then you see what kind of damage it can inflate on your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf and in the middle cotton leaf and on the left tomato leaf with these little stippling they can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking piercing and mouth parts of those spiders but here comes nature that provides us with a good spider this is a predatory mod just as small as the spider mite by the way one millimeter two millimeter long not more than that running quickly hunting chasing the spider mites and here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side just pierces such the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite and after five minutes this is what you see just typical dead corpse shriveled sucked out dead corpse of the spider mite and next to it two satiated individuals of predatory mice and mother on the left-hand side a young myth on the right hand side by the way a meal for them for 24 hours are about five individuals of the spider mites of the bad mites and or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites by the way they are hungry always and there is another example aphids by the way it's springtime now in israel when temperature rises sharply you can see those bad ones those aphids all over the plants in your hibiscus in your lantana on the young fresh foliage of the spring flush so-called by the way with aphids you have only females like amazon's females giving rise to females giving rise to other females no males at all parthenogenesis was so-called and they are very happy with that apparently and here you can see the damage those aphids secrete some sticky sugary liquid called honeydew and this just clogs the upper part of the plant you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of the black fungus mold which is covering it and here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp here we are not talking about the predator here we are talking about a parasite not a two-legged parasite but an eight-legged parasite of yours yeah this is a parasitic wasp again two meters long slender a very quick and sharp flyer and here you can see this parasite in action like in an acrobatic maneuver she stands vis-a-vis in front of the victim on the right-hand side bending his abdomen and inserting a single egg a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid by the way the effect tries to escape she kicks and and bites and secretes different liquids but nothing will happen in fact only the egg of the parasitoid will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid and after a few days depends on upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside and after and this is all natural this is all natural this is not fiction nothing at all again in your backyard in your backyard absolutely this is this is the end result this is the end result mummies m-u-m-y [Music] this is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside in fact a developing parenting toy that after a few minutes you see half way out the birth is almost complete you can see by the way different movies etc and it takes just a few minutes and if this is a female she will immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short this female can live only three to four days and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs that means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids and this is of course not the end of it there is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example again we'll start first with the quest the thrips by the way all these weird names huh i didn't bother you with the latinx of these creatures okay just the popular names but this is a nice slender very bad pest if you can see this sweet peppers this is not just an exotic or a metal sweet pepper this is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those three adults and here comes the natural enemy my note pirate bug my mood because it is rather small yeah you can see the adult black and two young ones and again in action this adult pierces the trips sucking it within just several minutes just going to the other prey continuing all over the place and if we spread those my root pirate bugs the good ones for example in a sweet pepper plot they go to the flowers and look this flower is flooded with predatory bugs with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones the trips so this is a very positive situation by the way no harm to the developing fruit no heart to the fruit set everything is justified under these circumstances but again the question is here you saw them on a one-to-one basis the past the natural enemy what we do is actually this in the northeast israel in kibbutz deliao there is a facility that mass produces those natural enemies in other words what we do there we amplify we amplify the natural control of the biological control phenomenon and in 30 000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses there we are mass producing those predatory mines those mild pirate bugs those parasitic wasps etc etc many different parts by the way they have a very nice landscape you see the jordanian mountains on one hand and they do jordan valley on the other hand and a good mild winter and a nice hot summer which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures by the way mass production it is not genetic manipulation there are no gmos genetically modified organisms whatsoever we take them from nature and the only thing that we do we give them the optimal conditions under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms in order to proliferate multiply and reproduce and that's what we get in fact you see under a microscope you see on the upper left corner you see the single predatory mite and this is a whole bunch of predatory mites you see this apple you see this one i have one gram of those predatory mites one grams 80 000 individuals 80 000 individuals are good enough to control one acre four thousand square meters of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year and we can produce from this believe you me several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis so this is what they call amplification of the phenomenon and no we do we do not disrupt the balance on the contrary because we bring it to agricultural plot where the balance or was already disrupted by the chemicals here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals that's the whole idea and what is the impact in this table you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs for example in israel where we employ more than one thousand hectares ten thousand donuts in israeli terms of biological pest-controlling sweet pepper under protection seventy-five percent of the pesticides were actually reduced and the israelis strawberries even more 80 percent of the pesticide especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries so the impact is very strong and there goes the question especially if you ask growers agriculturalists why biological control why good bugs by the way the number of answers you get equals to the number of people you ask but if we go for example to this place southeast israel the arava valley along the great rift valley where the really top-notch the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located especially under greenhouse conditions or under screen house conditions if you drive all the way to a lot you see this just in the middle of the desert and if you zoom in you can definitely watch this grandparents with their grandchildren distribute the natural enemies the good bugs instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applied chemicals so safety with respect to the application this is number one answer that we get from growers why biological control number two many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals just in our case that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics it's the same and it can happen very quickly fortunately in the biological control or in the natural control resistance is extremely rare it hardly happens because this is evolution this is the natural issue unlike resistance which happens in the case of chemicals and thirdly public demand public demand the more the public the public demands reduction of chemicals more growers become aware of the fact they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control with biological control even here there is another grower you see very interested in the bugs the bad ones and the good ones wearing this magnifier already on her head just walking safely in her crop finally i want to get to actually to my vision or in fact my dream because you see this is the reality have a look at the gap if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide is 250 million dollars and look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world i think it's times 100 or something like that 25 billion so there is a huge gap to bridge so actually how can we do it how can we bridge or let's say never disgrace this gap in the course of the years first of all we need to find more robust good and reliable biological solutions more good bugs that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field secondly to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agriculture of fresh produce and thirdly also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry and this gap really narrows step by step it does never so i think my last slide is all we are saying we can actually see it give nature a chance so i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners and implementers in israel and abroad really give nature a chance thank you

take a magnifying glass you see what i have here that's a magnifier times 10 yeah times 10 you just open it you just twist leaves and you see a whole new world of by nude insects or little spiders of one millimeter one and a half two meter millimeters long and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones so this phenomenon of of natural control exists literally everywhere here in front of this building i'm sure just have a look at the plants so it's everywhere and we need to know how to exploit it well let us look just hand by hand and browse through just a few examples what is a pest what damage it actually inflicts on the plant and what is the natural enemy the biological control agent or the good bug that we are talking about in general i'm going to talk about insects and spiders or mites let us call them insects those six select organisms and spider or mites the eight lead organisms let's have a look at that here is a pest devastating pest a spider mite because it does a lot of webbing like a spider you see the mother in between and two daughters probably on the left and right and a single egg on the right hand side and then you see what kind of damage it can inflate on your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf and in the middle cotton leaf and on the left tomato leaf with these little stippling they can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking piercing and mouth parts of those spiders but here comes nature that provides us with a good spider this is a predatory mod just as small as the spider mite by the way one millimeter two millimeter long not more than that running quickly hunting chasing the spider mites and here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side just pierces such the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite and after five minutes this is what you see just typical dead corpse shriveled sucked out dead corpse of the spider mite and next to it two satiated individuals of predatory mice and mother on the left-hand side a young myth on the right hand side by the way a meal for them for 24 hours are about five individuals of the spider mites of the bad mites and or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites by the way they are hungry always and there is another example aphids by the way it's springtime now in israel when temperature rises sharply you can see those bad ones those aphids all over the plants in your hibiscus in your lantana on the young fresh foliage of the spring flush so-called by the way with aphids you have only females like amazon's females giving rise to females giving rise to other females no males at all parthenogenesis was so-called and they are very happy with that apparently and here you can see the damage those aphids secrete some sticky sugary liquid called honeydew and this just clogs the upper part of the plant you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of the black fungus mold which is covering it and here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp here we are not talking about the predator here we are talking about a parasite not a two-legged parasite but an eight-legged parasite of yours yeah this is a parasitic wasp again two meters long slender a very quick and sharp flyer and here you can see this parasite in action like in an acrobatic maneuver she stands vis-a-vis in front of the victim on the right-hand side bending his abdomen and inserting a single egg a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid by the way the effect tries to escape she kicks and and bites and secretes different liquids but nothing will happen in fact only the egg of the parasitoid will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid and after a few days depends on upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside and after and this is all natural this is all natural this is not fiction nothing at all again in your backyard in your backyard absolutely this is this is the end result this is the end result mummies m-u-m-y [Music] this is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside in fact a developing parenting toy that after a few minutes you see half way out the birth is almost complete you can see by the way different movies etc and it takes just a few minutes and if this is a female she will immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short this female can live only three to four days and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs that means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids and this is of course not the end of it there is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example again we'll start first with the quest the thrips by the way all these weird names huh i didn't bother you with the latinx of these creatures okay just the popular names but this is a nice slender very bad pest if you can see this sweet peppers this is not just an exotic or a metal sweet pepper this is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those three adults and here comes the natural enemy my note pirate bug my mood because it is rather small yeah you can see the adult black and two young ones and again in action this adult pierces the trips sucking it within just several minutes just going to the other prey continuing all over the place and if we spread those my root pirate bugs the good ones for example in a sweet pepper plot they go to the flowers and look this flower is flooded with predatory bugs with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones the trips so this is a very positive situation by the way no harm to the developing fruit no heart to the fruit set everything is justified under these circumstances but again the question is here you saw them on a one-to-one basis the past the natural enemy what we do is actually this in the northeast israel in kibbutz deliao there is a facility that mass produces those natural enemies in other words what we do there we amplify we amplify the natural control of the biological control phenomenon and in 30 000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses there we are mass producing those predatory mines those mild pirate bugs those parasitic wasps etc etc many different parts by the way they have a very nice landscape you see the jordanian mountains on one hand and they do jordan valley on the other hand and a good mild winter and a nice hot summer which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures by the way mass production it is not genetic manipulation there are no gmos genetically modified organisms whatsoever we take them from nature and the only thing that we do we give them the optimal conditions under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms in order to proliferate multiply and reproduce and that's what we get in fact you see under a microscope you see on the upper left corner you see the single predatory mite and this is a whole bunch of predatory mites you see this apple you see this one i have one gram of those predatory mites one grams 80 000 individuals 80 000 individuals are good enough to control one acre four thousand square meters of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year and we can produce from this believe you me several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis so this is what they call amplification of the phenomenon and no we do we do not disrupt the balance on the contrary because we bring it to agricultural plot where the balance or was already disrupted by the chemicals here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals that's the whole idea and what is the impact in this table you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs for example in israel where we employ more than one thousand hectares ten thousand donuts in israeli terms of biological pest-controlling sweet pepper under protection seventy-five percent of the pesticides were actually reduced and the israelis strawberries even more 80 percent of the pesticide especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries so the impact is very strong and there goes the question especially if you ask growers agriculturalists why biological control why good bugs by the way the number of answers you get equals to the number of people you ask but if we go for example to this place southeast israel the arava valley along the great rift valley where the really top-notch the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located especially under greenhouse conditions or under screen house conditions if you drive all the way to a lot you see this just in the middle of the desert and if you zoom in you can definitely watch this grandparents with their grandchildren distribute the natural enemies the good bugs instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applied chemicals so safety with respect to the application this is number one answer that we get from growers why biological control number two many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals just in our case that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics it's the same and it can happen very quickly fortunately in the biological control or in the natural control resistance is extremely rare it hardly happens because this is evolution this is the natural issue unlike resistance which happens in the case of chemicals and thirdly public demand public demand the more the public the public demands reduction of chemicals more growers become aware of the fact they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control with biological control even here there is another grower you see very interested in the bugs the bad ones and the good ones wearing this magnifier already on her head just walking safely in her crop finally i want to get to actually to my vision or in fact my dream because you see this is the reality have a look at the gap if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide is 250 million dollars and look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world i think it's times 100 or something like that 25 billion so there is a huge gap to bridge so actually how can we do it how can we bridge or let's say never disgrace this gap in the course of the years first of all we need to find more robust good and reliable biological solutions more good bugs that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field secondly to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agriculture of fresh produce and thirdly also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry and this gap really narrows step by step it does never so i think my last slide is all we are saying we can actually see it give nature a chance so i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners and implementers in israel and abroad really give nature a chance thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] i'm a bug lover myself not from childhood by the way but rather late uh when i bachelored a major in zoology in tel aviv university i kind of fell in love with bugs and then within zoology i took the course of the discipline of entomology the science of insects and then i thought myself how can i be practical or or help in the science of entomology and then i moved to the world of plant protection plant protection from insects from bedbugs and then within plant protection i came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests so it's a whole discipline in plant protection that aiming at reduction of chemicals and biological pest control by the way or these good bugs that we are talking about they exist in the world for thousands and thousands of years for a long long time but only in the hundred and last hundred and twenty years people started or people knew more and more how to explore how to use this biological control phenomenon or in fact natural control phenomenon to their own needs because biological control phenomena you can see it in your backyard just take a magnifying glass you see what i have here that's a magnifier times 10 yeah times 10 you just open it you just twist leaves and you see a whole new world of by nude insects or little spiders of one millimeter one and a half two meter millimeters long and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones so this phenomenon of of natural control exists literally everywhere here in front of this building i'm sure just have a look at the plants so it's everywhere and we need to know how to exploit it well let us look just hand by hand and browse through just a few examples what is a pest what damage it actually inflicts on the plant and what is the natural enemy the biological control agent or the good bug that we are talking about in general i'm going to talk about insects and spiders or mites let us call them insects those six select organisms and spider or mites the eight lead organisms let's have a look at that here is a pest devastating pest a spider mite because it does a lot of webbing like a spider you see the mother in between and two daughters probably on the left and right and a single egg on the right hand side and then you see what kind of damage it can inflate on your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf and in the middle cotton leaf and on the left tomato leaf with these little stippling they can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking piercing and mouth parts of those spiders but here comes nature that provides us with a good spider this is a predatory mod just as small as the spider mite by the way one millimeter two millimeter long not more than that running quickly hunting chasing the spider mites and here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side just pierces such the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite and after five minutes this is what you see just typical dead corpse shriveled sucked out dead corpse of the spider mite and next to it two satiated individuals of predatory mice and mother on the left-hand side a young myth on the right hand side by the way a meal for them for 24 hours are about five individuals of the spider mites of the bad mites and or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites by the way they are hungry always and there is another example aphids by the way it's springtime now in israel when temperature rises sharply you can see those bad ones those aphids all over the plants in your hibiscus in your lantana on the young fresh foliage of the spring flush so-called by the way with aphids you have only females like amazon's females giving rise to females giving rise to other females no males at all parthenogenesis was so-called and they are very happy with that apparently and here you can see the damage those aphids secrete some sticky sugary liquid called honeydew and this just clogs the upper part of the plant you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of the black fungus mold which is covering it and here

especially if you ask growers agriculturalists why biological control why good bugs by the way the number of answers you get equals to the number of people you ask but if we go for example to this place southeast israel the arava valley along the great rift valley where the really top-notch the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located especially under greenhouse conditions or under screen house conditions if you drive all the way to a lot you see this just in the middle of the desert and if you zoom in you can definitely watch this grandparents with their grandchildren distribute the natural enemies the good bugs instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applied chemicals so safety with respect to the application this is number one answer that we get from growers why biological control number two many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals just in our case that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics it's the same and it can happen very quickly fortunately in the biological control or in the natural control resistance is extremely rare it hardly happens because this is evolution this is the natural issue unlike resistance which happens in the case of chemicals and thirdly public demand public demand the more the public the public demands reduction of chemicals more growers become aware of the fact they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control with biological control even here there is another grower you see very interested in the bugs the bad ones and the good ones wearing this magnifier already on her head just walking safely in her crop finally i want to get to actually to my vision or in fact my dream because you see this is the reality have a look at the gap if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide is 250 million dollars and look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world i think it's times 100 or something like that 25 billion so there is a huge gap to bridge so actually how can we do it how can we bridge or let's say never disgrace this gap in the course of the years first of all we need to find more robust good and reliable biological solutions more good bugs that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field secondly to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agriculture of fresh produce and thirdly also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry and this gap really narrows step by step it does never so i think my last slide is all we are saying we can actually see it give nature a chance so i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners and implementers in israel and abroad really give nature a chance thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] my name is Seth preat I'm the chief ninja of scavenger I I am a proud Princeton Dropout also proud to have relocated here to Boston where I actually grew up uh and yeah Boston easy wins I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here so I'm also I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world uh and this is sort of A New Concept and it's really important because while the last decade was the decade of Social and the decade of where the framework in which we connect with other people was built this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior and the framework in which that is constructed uh is decided upon and that's really important and so I say that I want to build a game on top of the world uh but that's not quite true because uh it's already under construction it's already happening uh and it looks like this right now it looks like the web did back in 1997 right it's not very good uh it's cluttered it's filled with lots of different things that in short aren't that fun uh there are credit card schemes and Airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game Dynamics and actually are building the game layer uh they just suck uh they're not very welld designed right so that's unfortunate um but luckily uh as as as my my favorite Action Hero Bob the Builder says uh we can do better we can build this better and the tools the resources that we use to build a game layer are game Dynamics themselves and so sort of the Crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game Dynamics really interesting things that if you use consciously you can use to influence behavior both for good for bad for in between hopefully for good but this is the sort of the the the important stages in which that framework will get built and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now um just before we jump into that there's sort of a question of why is this important I'm sort of making this claim that there is a gameer on top of the world and that it's very important that we build it properly uh the reason that it's so important is that the last decade what we've seen has been building the social lir has been this framework for connections and construction on that lirer is over uh it's finished there's still a lot to explore there's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this but the framework itself is done and it's called Facebook uh and and that's okay right A lot of people are very happy with Facebook I I like it quite a lot they've created this thing called the open graph and they own all of our connections they own half a billion people and so when you want to build on the social Lair the framework has been decided it is the open graph API and if you're happy with that fantastic if you're not too bad there's nothing you can do but this next decade no and and that that's a real thing I mean we want we want to build Frameworks in a way that that makes it it that makes it acceptable and makes it you know productive down the road so the social layer is all about these connections the game layer is all about influence it's not about adding a social fabric to the web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go it's actually about using Dynamics using forces to influence the behavior of where you are what you do there how you do it that's really really powerful and it's going to be more important in the social air it's going to affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly and so it's incredibly critical that at this moment while it's just getting constructed while the Frameworks like Facebook like the open graph are being created for the game Lair equivalent that we think about it very consciously and that we do it in a way that is open that is available and that can be leveraged for good and so that's what I want to talk about for game Dynamics because construction has just begun and the more consciously we can think about this the better we'll be able to use it for anything that we want so uh like I said the way the way that you go through and build on the game layer is not with uh you know glass and steel and cement and the resources that we use are not this two-dimensional swath of land that we have the resources are mind share and the tools the raw materials are these game Dynamics so with that you know a couple game Dynamics to talk about four um back at scavenger we like to joke that with seven game Dynamics you can get anyone to do anything and so today I'm going to show you four uh because I hope to have a competitive Advantage at the end of this still uh so so the first one uh it's a very simple game Dynamic uh it's called the appointment Dynamic and this is a dynamic in which to succeed players have to do something at a predefined time generally at a predefined place uh and these Dynamics are a little scary sometimes because you think you know other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact what I do where I do it when I do it that that this sort of loss of free will that occurs in games can be frightening so with each Dynamic I'm going to give three examples uh one that shows how this is already being used in the real world so you can sort of rationalize it a little bit one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game I think everything is a game but this is sort of more of a you know what you would think is a game played on a you know board or on a computer screen and then one how this can be used for good so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful so the first one the most famous appointment dynamic in the world is something called happy hour uh so so so uh I just recently dropped out of Princeton and actually ended up uh for the first time in a bar and I saw these happy hour things all over the place right and this is simply an appointment Dynamic come here at a certain time get your drinks half off to win all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time uh this game Dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our Behavior it's influenced our entire culture and that that's that's a really scary thought that one game Dynamic can change things so powerfully um it also exists in more conventional game forms I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now if you haven't I recommend playing it you won't do anything else for the rest of your day uh Farmville has more active users than Twitter uh it's incredibly powerful and it has this Dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops fake crops or they Wilt and this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats when they say your Farms your your crops Wilt after 8 hours or after 6 hours or after 24 hours it changes the life cycle of 70 million some people during the day they will return like clockwork at different times so if they wanted the world to end if they wanted productivity to stop they could make this a 30-minute cycle and no one could do anything else right that that's a little scary but but this can also be used for good um this is a local company called vitality and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time right that's an appointment uh it's it's something that people don't do very well and they have these glow caps which you know Flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine uh this is one that isn't a game yet but really should be you should get points for doing this on time you should lose points for not doing this on time they should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment Dynamic and leverage the games and then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways uh we're going to jump on to the next one maybe yes uh influence and Status so so this is one of the most one of the most famous game Dynamics it's used all over the place uh it's used in your wallets right now right we all want that credit card on the far left because it's black and you see someone at CVS or or not CVS like like Christian Dior or something right and then I don't know I don't have a black card I've got a debit card but they but they they so they they whip it out and and you see man they have that black card I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am and and I and I need that uh and this is used in games as well Modern Warfare one of the most successful selling games of all time I'm only a level four but but I desperately you know want to be a level 10 because they've got that cool Red Badge thing and that means that that I am somehow better uh than everyone else and and that's very powerful to me status is a really good motivator um it's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings School uh and remember I made it through one year so I think I'm I'm qualified to talk on School uh is a game it's just not a terribly well-designed game right there are levels there are C there are B There is a there are statuses I mean what is Valedictorian but a status if we called Val valedictorian a you know White Knight Paladin level 20 uh I think people would probably work a lot harder so so so so school is a game and there' have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly but let's use it consciously like why have games that you can lose why go from an A to an F or a B to a c that sucks why not level up and at Princeton they've actually experiment experimented with this where they have quizzes where you gain experience points and you level up from B to an A and and it's very powerful it can be used in interesting ways uh the third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression Dynamic where you have to sort of make progress you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion um this is used all over the place including LinkedIn where um I I am an unho individual I am only 85% complete on LinkedIn and that bothers me and and and this is this is so deep-seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar we will do it we will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen uh this is used in conventional games as well I mean you see you know this is a paladin level 10 and that's a paladin level 20 and and if you were going to fight you know Orcs on the fields of Mordor against the razal ghoul you'd probably want to be the the bigger one right I would uh and so people work very hard to level up um World of Warcraft is one of the most successful games of all time um the average player spend something like six six and a half hours a day on it they most their most dedicated players it's like a full-time job it's it's insane and they have these systems where you can level up um and that's a very powerful thing progression is powerful uh it can also be used in very compelling ways for good uh one of the things that we work on at scavenger is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses to sort of something that is very key to the economy and here we have a game you know that people play they go places they do challenges they earn points and we've introduced a progression Dynamic into it where by going to the same place over and over by doing challenges by engaging with the business you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen and you eventually unlock rewards um and this is powerful enough that we can see that it hooks people into these Dynamics pulls them back to the same local businesses creates huge loyalty creates engagement and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses uh these progression Dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world uh the final one I want to talk about and it's a great one to end on is this concept of communal Discovery a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something uh and communal Discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems um this is used in some sort of famous consumer web stories like dig which I'm sure you've all heard of uh dig is a communal Dynamic to try and find and Source the best news the most interesting stories and they made this into a game uh initially they had a leaderboard where if you recommended the best stories you would get points uh and that that really motivated people to find the best stories but it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal a group of people the top seven uh on the leaderboard who would work together to make sure that they maintained that position and they would recommend other people's stories and the game became more powerful than the goal and they actually had to end up shutting down the leaderboard because while it was effective it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership so we have to use this one carefully um it's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly where the game is not the Monopoly game you're playing but these sort of cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk right and now they're just looking for a little sticker that says Boardwalk but it can also be used to find real things uh this is the DARPA balloon challenge where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said use networks try and find these balloons fastest and the winner will get $40,000 and the winner was actually a group out of MIT where they created sort of a pyramid scheme a network where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $2,000 and anyone else to you know push that recommendation up also got a cut of it and in 12 hours they were able to find all these balloons all across the country right really powerful Dynamic and so I've got about you know 20 seconds so if I'm going to leave you with anything uh last decade was the decade of social this next decade is the decade of games we use game Dynamics to build on it we build with mind share we can influence behavior it is very powerful it is very exciting let's all build it together let's do it well and have fun [Applause] playing

and that's a very powerful thing progression is powerful uh it can also be used in very compelling ways for good uh one of the things that we work on at scavenger is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses to sort of something that is very key to the economy and here we have a game you know that people play they go places they do challenges they earn points and we've introduced a progression Dynamic into it where by going to the same place over and over by doing challenges by engaging with the business you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen and you eventually unlock rewards um and this is powerful enough that we can see that it hooks people into these Dynamics pulls them back to the same local businesses creates huge loyalty creates engagement and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses uh these progression Dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world uh the final one I want to talk about and it's a great one to end on is this concept of communal Discovery a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something uh and communal Discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems um this is used in some sort of famous consumer web stories like dig which I'm sure you've all heard of uh dig is a communal Dynamic to try and find and Source the best news the most interesting stories and they made this into a game uh initially they had a leaderboard where if you recommended the best stories you would get points uh and that that really motivated people to find the best stories but it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal a group of people the top seven uh on the leaderboard who would work together to make sure that they maintained that position and they would recommend other people's stories and the game became more powerful than the goal and they actually had to end up shutting down the leaderboard because while it was effective it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership so we have to use this one carefully um it's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly where the game is not the Monopoly game you're playing but these sort of cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk right and now they're just looking for a little sticker that says Boardwalk but it can also be used to find real things uh this is the DARPA balloon challenge where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said use networks try and find these balloons fastest and the winner will get $40,000 and the winner was actually a group out of MIT where they created sort of a pyramid scheme a network where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $2,000 and anyone else to you know push that recommendation up also got a cut of it and in 12 hours they were able to find all these balloons all across the country right really powerful Dynamic and so I've got about you know 20 seconds so if I'm going to leave you with anything uh last decade was the decade of social this next decade is the decade of games we use game Dynamics to build on it we build with mind share we can influence behavior it is very powerful it is very exciting let's all build it together let's do it well and have fun [Applause] playing

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] my name is Seth preat I'm the chief ninja of scavenger I I am a proud Princeton Dropout also proud to have relocated here to Boston where I actually grew up uh and yeah Boston easy wins I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here so I'm also I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world uh and this is sort of A New Concept and it's really important because while the last decade was the decade of Social and the decade of where the framework in which we connect with other people was built this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior and the framework in which that is constructed uh is decided upon and that's really important and so I say that I want to build a game on top of the world uh but that's not quite true because uh it's already under construction it's already happening uh and it looks like this right now it looks like the web did back in 1997 right it's not very good uh it's cluttered it's filled with lots of different things that in short aren't that fun uh there are credit card schemes and Airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game Dynamics and actually are building the game layer uh they just suck uh they're not very welld designed right so that's unfortunate um but luckily uh as as as my my favorite Action Hero Bob the Builder says uh we can do better we can build this better and the tools the resources that we use to build a game layer are game Dynamics themselves and so sort of the Crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game Dynamics really interesting things that if you use consciously you can use to influence behavior both for good for bad for in between hopefully for good but this is the sort of the the the important stages in which that framework will get built and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now um just before we jump into that there's sort of a question of why is this important I'm sort of making this claim that there is a gameer on top of the world and that it's very important that we build it properly uh the reason that it's so important is that the last decade what we've seen has been building the social lir has been this framework for connections and construction on that lirer is over uh it's finished there's still a lot to explore there's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this but the framework itself is done and it's called Facebook uh and and that's okay right A lot of people are very happy with Facebook I I like it quite a lot they've created this thing called the open graph and they own all of our connections they own half a billion people and so when you want to build on the social Lair the framework has been decided it is the open graph API and if you're happy with that fantastic if you're not too bad there's nothing you can do but this next decade no and and that that's a real thing I mean we want we want to build Frameworks in a way that that makes it it that makes it acceptable and makes it you know productive down the road so the social layer is all about these connections the game layer is all about influence it's not about adding a social fabric to the web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go it's actually about using Dynamics using forces to influence the behavior of where you are what you do there how you do it that's really really powerful and it's going to be more important in the social air it's going to affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly and so it's incredibly critical that at this moment while it's just getting constructed while the Frameworks like Facebook like the open graph are being created for the game Lair equivalent that we think about it very consciously and that we do it in a way that is open that is available and that can be leveraged for good and so that's what I want to talk about for game Dynamics because construction has just begun and the more consciously we can think about this the better we'll be able to use it for anything that we want so uh like I said the way the way that you go through and build on the game layer is not with uh you know glass and steel and cement and the resources that we use are not this two-dimensional swath of land that we have the resources are mind share and the tools the raw materials are these game Dynamics so with that you know a couple game Dynamics to talk about four um back at scavenger we like to joke that with seven game Dynamics you can get anyone to do anything and so today I'm going to show you four uh because I hope to have a competitive Advantage at the end of this still uh so so the first one uh it's a very simple game Dynamic uh it's called the appointment Dynamic and this is a dynamic in which to succeed players have to do something at a predefined time generally at a predefined place uh and these Dynamics are a little scary sometimes because you think you know other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact what I do where I do it when I do it that that this sort of loss of free will that occurs in games can be frightening so with each Dynamic I'm going to give three examples uh one that shows how this is already being used in the real world so you can sort of rationalize it a little bit one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game I think everything is a game but this is sort of more of a you know what you would think is a game played on a you know board or on a computer screen and then one how this can be used for good so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful so the first one the most famous appointment dynamic in the world is something called happy hour uh so so so uh I just recently dropped out of Princeton and actually ended up uh for the first time in a bar and I saw these happy hour things all over the place right and this is simply an appointment Dynamic come here at a certain time get your drinks half off to win all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time uh this game Dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our Behavior it's influenced our entire culture and that that's that's a really scary thought that one game Dynamic can change things so powerfully um it also exists in more conventional game forms I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now if you haven't I recommend playing it you won't do anything else for the rest of your day uh Farmville has more active users than Twitter uh it's incredibly powerful and it has this Dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops fake crops or they Wilt and this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats when they say your Farms your your crops Wilt after 8 hours or after 6 hours or after 24 hours it changes the life cycle of 70 million some people during the day they will return like clockwork at different times so if they wanted the world to end if they wanted productivity to stop they could make this a 30-minute cycle and no one could do anything else right that that's a little scary but but this can also be used for good um this is a local company called vitality and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time right that's an appointment uh it's it's something that people don't do very well and they have these glow caps which you know Flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine uh this is one that isn't a game yet but really should be you should get points for doing this on time you should lose points for not doing this on time they should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment Dynamic and leverage the games and then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways uh we're going to jump on to the next one maybe yes uh influence and Status so so this is one of the most one of the most famous game Dynamics it's used all over the place uh it's used in your wallets right now right we all want that credit card on the far left because it's black and you see someone at CVS or or not CVS like like Christian Dior or something right and then I don't know I don't have a black card I've got a debit card but they but they they so they they whip it out and and you see man they have that black card I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am and and I and I need that uh and this is used in games as well Modern Warfare one of the most successful selling games of all time I'm only a level four but but I desperately you know want to be a level 10 because they've got that cool Red Badge thing and that means that that I am somehow better uh than everyone else and and that's very powerful to me status is a really good motivator um it's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings School uh and remember I made it through one year so I think I'm I'm qualified to talk on School uh is a game it's just not a terribly well-designed game right there are levels there are C there are B There is a there are statuses I mean what is Valedictorian but a status if we called Val valedictorian a you know White Knight Paladin level 20 uh I think people would probably work a lot harder so so so so school is a game and there' have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly but let's use it consciously like why have games that you can lose why go from an A to an F or a B to a c that sucks why not level up and at Princeton they've actually experiment experimented with this where they have quizzes where you gain experience points and you level up from B to an A and and it's very powerful it can be used in interesting ways uh the third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression Dynamic where you have to sort of make progress you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion um this is used all over the place including LinkedIn where um I I am an unho individual I am only 85% complete on LinkedIn and that bothers me and and and this is this is so deep-seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar we will do it we will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen uh this is used in conventional games as well I mean you see you know this is a paladin level 10 and that's a paladin level 20 and and if you were going to fight you know Orcs on the fields of Mordor against the razal ghoul you'd probably want to be the the bigger one right I would uh and so people work very hard to level up um World of Warcraft is one of the most successful games of all time um the average player spend something like six six and a half hours a day on it they most their most dedicated players it's like a full-time job it's it's insane and they have these systems where you can level up um and that's a very powerful thing progression is powerful uh it can also be used in very compelling ways for good uh one of the things that we work on at scavenger is how do you use games to drive

bar and presented with easy granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar we will do it we will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen uh this is used in conventional games as well I mean you see you know this is a paladin level 10 and that's a paladin level 20 and and if you were going to fight you know Orcs on the fields of Mordor against the razal ghoul you'd probably want to be the the bigger one right I would uh and so people work very hard to level up um World of Warcraft is one of the most successful games of all time um the average player spend something like six six and a half hours a day on it they most their most dedicated players it's like a full-time job it's it's insane and they have these systems where you can level up um and that's a very powerful thing progression is powerful uh it can also be used in very compelling ways for good uh one of the things that we work on at scavenger is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses to sort of something that is very key to the economy and here we have a game you know that people play they go places they do challenges they earn points and we've introduced a progression Dynamic into it where by going to the same place over and over by doing challenges by engaging with the business you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen and you eventually unlock rewards um and this is powerful enough that we can see that it hooks people into these Dynamics pulls them back to the same local businesses creates huge loyalty creates engagement and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses uh these progression Dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world uh the final one I want to talk about and it's a great one to end on is this concept of communal Discovery a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something uh and communal Discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems um this is used in some sort of famous consumer web stories like dig which I'm sure you've all heard of uh dig is a communal Dynamic to try and find and Source the best news the most interesting stories and they made this into a game uh initially they had a leaderboard where if you recommended the best stories you would get points uh and that that really motivated people to find the best stories but it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal a group of people the top seven uh on the leaderboard who would work together to make sure that they maintained that position and they would recommend other people's stories and the game became more powerful than the goal and they actually had to end up shutting down the leaderboard because while it was effective it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership so we have to use this one carefully um it's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly where the game is not the Monopoly game you're playing but these sort of cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk right and now they're just looking for a little sticker that says Boardwalk but it can also be used to find real things uh this is the DARPA balloon challenge where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said use networks try and find these balloons fastest and the winner will get $40,000 and the winner was actually a group out of MIT where they created sort of a pyramid scheme a network where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $2,000 and anyone else to you know push that recommendation up also got a cut of it and in 12 hours they were able to find all these balloons all across the country right really powerful Dynamic and so I've got about you know 20 seconds so if I'm going to leave you with anything uh last decade was the decade of social this next decade is the decade of games we use game Dynamics to build on it we build with mind share we can influence behavior it is very powerful it is very exciting let's all build it together let's do it well and have fun [Applause] playing

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] my name is Seth preat I'm the chief ninja of scavenger I I am a proud Princeton Dropout also proud to have relocated here to Boston where I actually grew up uh and yeah Boston easy wins I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here so I'm also I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world uh and this is sort of A New Concept and it's really important because while the last decade was the decade of Social and the decade of where the framework in which we connect with other people was built this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior and the framework in which that is constructed uh is decided upon and that's really important and so I say that I want to build a game on top of the world uh but that's not quite true because uh it's already under construction it's already happening uh and it looks like this right now it looks like the web did back in 1997 right it's not very good uh it's cluttered it's filled with lots of different things that in short aren't that fun uh there are credit card schemes and Airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game Dynamics and actually are building the game layer uh they just suck uh they're not very welld designed right so that's unfortunate um but luckily uh as as as my my favorite Action Hero Bob the Builder says uh we can do better we can build this better and the tools the resources that we use to build a game layer are game Dynamics themselves and so sort of the Crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game Dynamics really interesting things that if you use consciously you can use to influence behavior both for good for bad for in between hopefully for good but this is the sort of the the the important stages in which that framework will get built and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now um just before we jump into that there's sort of a question of why is this important I'm sort of making this claim that there is a gameer on top of the world and that it's very important that we build it properly uh the reason that it's so important is that the last decade what we've seen has been building the social lir has been this framework for connections and construction on that lirer is over uh it's finished there's still a lot to explore there's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this but the framework itself is done and it's called Facebook uh and and that's okay right A lot of people are very happy with Facebook I I like it quite a lot they've created this thing called the open graph and they own all of our connections they own half a billion people and so when you want to build on the social Lair the framework has been decided it is the open graph API and if you're happy with that fantastic if you're not too bad there's nothing you can do but this next decade no and and that that's a real thing I mean we want we want to build Frameworks in a way that that makes it it that makes it acceptable and makes it you know productive down the road so the social layer is all about these connections the game layer is all about influence it's not about adding a social fabric to the web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go it's actually about using Dynamics using forces to influence the behavior of where you are what you do there how you do it that's really really powerful and it's going to be more important in the social air it's going to affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly and so it's incredibly critical that at this moment while it's just getting constructed while the Frameworks like Facebook like the open graph are being created for the game Lair equivalent that we think about it very consciously and that we do it in a way that is open that is available and that can be leveraged for good and so that's what I want to talk about for game Dynamics because construction has just begun and the more consciously we can think about this the better we'll be able to use it for anything that we want so uh like I said the way the way that you go through and build on the game layer is not with uh you know glass and steel and cement and the resources that we use are not this two-dimensional swath of land that we have the resources are mind share and the tools the raw materials are these game Dynamics so with that you know a couple game Dynamics to talk about four um back at scavenger we like to joke that with seven game Dynamics you can get anyone to do anything and so today I'm going to show you four uh because I hope to have a competitive Advantage at the end of this still uh so so the first one uh it's a very simple game Dynamic uh it's called the appointment Dynamic and this is a dynamic in which to succeed players have to do something at a predefined time generally at a predefined place uh and these Dynamics are a little scary sometimes because you think you know other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact what I do where I do it when I do it that that this sort of loss of free will that occurs in games can be frightening so with each Dynamic I'm going to give three examples uh one that shows how this is already being used in the real world so you can sort of rationalize it a little bit one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game I think everything is a game but this is sort of more of a you know what you would think is a game played on a you know board or on a computer screen and then one how this can be used for good so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful so the first one the most famous appointment dynamic in the world is something called happy hour uh so so so uh I just recently dropped out of Princeton and actually ended up uh for the first time in a bar and I saw these happy hour things all over the place right and this is simply an appointment Dynamic come here at a certain time get your drinks half off to win all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time uh this game Dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our Behavior it's influenced our entire culture and that that's that's a really scary thought that one game Dynamic can change things so powerfully um it also exists in more conventional game forms I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now if you haven't I recommend playing it you won't do anything else for the rest of your day uh Farmville has more active users than Twitter uh it's incredibly powerful and it has this Dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops fake crops or they Wilt and this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats when they say your Farms your your crops Wilt after 8 hours or after 6 hours or after 24 hours it changes the life cycle of 70 million some people during the day they will return like clockwork at different times so if they wanted the world to end if they wanted productivity to stop they could make this a 30-minute cycle and no one could do anything else right that that's a little scary but but this can also be used for good um this is a local company called vitality and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time right that's an appointment uh it's it's something that people don't do very well and they have these glow caps which you know Flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine uh this is one that isn't a game yet but really should be you should get points for doing this on time you should lose points for not doing this on time they should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment Dynamic and leverage the games and then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways uh we're going to jump on to the next one maybe yes uh influence and Status so so this is one of the most one of the most famous game Dynamics it's used all over the place uh it's used in your wallets right now right we all want that credit card on the far left because it's black and you see someone at CVS or or not CVS like like Christian Dior or something right and then I don't know I don't have a black card I've got a debit card but they but they they so they they whip it out and and you see man they have that black card I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am and and I and I need that uh and this is used in games as well Modern Warfare one of the most successful selling games of all time I'm only a level four but but I desperately you know want to be a level 10 because they've got that cool Red Badge thing and that means that that I am somehow better uh than everyone else and and that's very powerful to me status is a really good motivator um it's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings School uh and remember I made it through one year so I think I'm I'm qualified to talk on School uh is a game it's just not a terribly well-designed game right there are levels there are C there are B There is a there are statuses I mean what is Valedictorian but a status if we called Val valedictorian a you know White Knight Paladin level 20 uh I think people would probably work a lot harder so so so so school is a game and there' have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly but let's use it consciously like why have games that you can lose why go from an A to an F or a B to a c that sucks why not level up and at Princeton they've actually experiment experimented with this where they have quizzes where you gain experience points and you level up from B to an A and and it's very powerful it can be used in interesting ways uh the third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression Dynamic where you have to sort of make progress you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion um this is used all over the place including LinkedIn where um I I am an unho individual I am only 85% complete on LinkedIn and that bothers me and and and this is this is so deep-seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar we will do it we will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen uh this is

**Transcript**:
I am a cultural omnivore one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod an iPod that contains vogner and Mozart pop diva Christina Aguilera country singer Josh Turner got gangster rap artist Kirk Franklin concerto symphonies and more and more I'm a voracious reader a reader who do deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephenie Meyer I have read the Twilight tetralogy and one who lives for my home theater a home theater write of our DVDs video-on-demand and for a lot of television for me Law & Order SVU Tina Fey and 30 rock and Judge Judy the people are real the cases are real the rulings are final now I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions especially my passion for Judge Judy and you fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us but I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life a passion for the live professional performing arts performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire yes but jazz as well modern dance opera theatre and more and more and more you know frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems we now realize that the Internet is if anything too effective in that regard depending on who you read an arts organization or an artist who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer now competes with between three and five thousand different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day we now know in fact that technology's our biggest competitor for leisure time five years ago Gen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV the majority on TV Gen Y are spent even more twenty three point eight hours the majority online and now a typical in a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent twenty thousand hours online and an additional ten thousand hours playing video games a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined moreover we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep we can shop at 3:00 in the morning or 8:00 at night ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body types ex expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts which have set curtain times set venues attended inconveniences of travel parking and the like simply cannot meet and we're all acutely aware what's it gonna mean in the future when we asked someone to pay $100 for a symphony opera or ballet ticket when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the Internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free these are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain but as particular as they feel to us we know we're not alone all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and communications a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry the magazine industry the book and publishing industry and more saddled in the Performing Arts as we are by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction in streaming locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues where we charge exorbitant prices many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves are we next everyone I talked to in performing arts resonates to the world of aid words of Adrian rich who in dreams of a common language wrote we are out in a country that has no language no laws whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they gave us are out-of-date by years and for those of you who love the arts aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day now rather than saying that we're a bit brink of our own annihilation I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental Reformation a Reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century the arts Reformation like the religious Reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed the printing press really leading the charge on the religious and Reformation both Reformation czar predicated on fractious discussion internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models and at heart both Reformation I think we're asking the questions who's entitled to practice how are they entitled to practice and indeed do we need anyone to inter mediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine Chris Anderson someone I trust you all know editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and author of the long tale really was the first for me to nail a lot of this he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet web cell a web technology minicams and more the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history in the 1930s if any of you wanted to make a movie you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more and now who in this room doesn't know a 14-year old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the 30s Warner Brothers RKO did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market a time when anyone is a potential author frankly what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations this group others have called the pro Am's amateur artists doing work at a professional level you see them on YouTube and dance competitions film festivals and more they are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions ultimately we now live in a world defined not by consumption but by participation but I want to be clear just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal church or to the priesthood I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community as by far too short-sighted and indeed while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional the single most exciting development in the last five to ten years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women's rights or human rights around global warming issues or AIDS relief or more not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada but by Liz Lerman's dance exchange a multi-generational professional dance company whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN today's professional theater community is defined not only by the Shah and Stratford festivals but by the cornerstone Theatre of Los Angeles a collective of artists that after nine Levin brought together ten different religious communities the Baha'i the Catholic the Muslim the Jewish even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross community healing today's performers like we're deaf salons work in women's prisons helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs do you find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more and indeed I think rather than being annihilated the Performing Arts are poised on the brink of a time where we will be more important than we have ever been you know we've said for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy dollars spent in restaurants from parking at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes the piano tuner who chooses the instruments and more but the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward especially in industries we can't even imagine yet just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries which few if any of us could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence the ability to listen deeply to have empathy to articulate change to motivate others the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter especially now as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the Arts to shape our individual and national characters and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience ultimately especially now in this world where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws in reality-tv that thrives on humiliation and in its context of announcements where the thing we hear most repeatedly day-in day-out in the United States in every train station every bus station every plane station is ladies and gentlemen please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion

I am a cultural omnivore one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod an iPod that contains vogner and Mozart pop diva Christina Aguilera country singer Josh Turner got gangster

for my home theater a home theater write of our DVDs video-on-demand and for a lot of television for me Law & Order SVU Tina Fey and 30 rock and Judge Judy the people are real the cases are real the rulings are final now I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions especially my passion for Judge Judy and you fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us but I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life a passion for the live professional performing arts performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire yes but jazz as well modern dance opera theatre and more and more and more you know frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems we now realize that the Internet is if anything too effective in that regard depending on who you read an arts organization or an artist who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer now competes with between three and five thousand different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day we now know in fact that technology's our biggest competitor for leisure time five years ago Gen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV the majority on TV Gen Y are spent even more twenty three point eight hours the majority online and now a typical in a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent twenty thousand hours online and an additional ten thousand hours playing video games a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined moreover we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep we can shop at 3:00 in the morning or 8:00 at night ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body types ex expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts which have set curtain times set venues attended inconveniences of travel parking and the like simply cannot meet and we're all acutely aware what's it gonna mean in the future when we asked someone to pay $100 for a symphony opera or ballet ticket when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the Internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free these are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain but as particular as they feel to us we know we're not alone all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and communications a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry the magazine industry the book and publishing industry and more saddled in the Performing Arts as we are by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction in streaming locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues where we charge exorbitant prices many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves are we next everyone I talked to in performing arts resonates to the world of aid words of Adrian rich who in dreams of a common language wrote we are out in a country that has no language no laws whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they gave us are out-of-date by years and for those of you who love the arts aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day now rather than saying that we're a bit brink of our own annihilation I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental Reformation a Reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century the arts Reformation like the religious Reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed the printing press really leading the charge on the religious and Reformation both Reformation czar predicated on fractious discussion internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models and at heart both Reformation I think we're asking the questions who's entitled to practice how are they entitled to practice and indeed do we need anyone to inter mediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine Chris Anderson someone I trust you all know editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and author of the long tale really was the first for me to nail a lot of this he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet web cell a web technology minicams and more the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history in the 1930s if any of you wanted to make a movie you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more and now who in this room doesn't know a 14-year old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the 30s Warner Brothers RKO did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market a time when anyone is a potential author frankly what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations this group others have called the pro Am's amateur artists doing work at a professional level you see them on YouTube and dance competitions film festivals and more they are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions ultimately we now live in a world defined not by consumption but by participation but I want to be clear just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal church or to the priesthood I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community as by far too short-sighted and indeed while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional the single most exciting development in the last five to ten years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women's rights or human rights around global warming issues or AIDS relief or more not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada but by Liz Lerman's dance exchange a multi-generational professional dance company whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN today's professional theater community is defined not only by the Shah and Stratford festivals but by the cornerstone Theatre of Los Angeles a collective of artists that after nine Levin brought together ten different religious communities the Baha'i the Catholic the Muslim the Jewish even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross community healing today's performers like we're deaf salons work in women's prisons helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs do you find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more and indeed I think rather than being annihilated the Performing Arts are poised on the brink of a time where we will be more important than we have ever been you know we've said for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy dollars spent in restaurants from parking at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes the piano tuner who chooses the instruments and more but the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward especially in industries we can't even imagine yet just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries which few if any of us could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence the ability to listen deeply to have empathy to articulate change to motivate others the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter especially now as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the Arts to shape our individual and national characters and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience ultimately especially now in this world where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws in reality-tv that thrives on humiliation and in its context of announcements where the thing we hear most repeatedly day-in day-out in the United States in every train station every bus station every plane station is ladies and gentlemen please report any

additional ten thousand hours playing video games a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined moreover we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep we can shop at 3:00 in the morning or 8:00 at night ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body types ex expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts which have set curtain times set venues attended inconveniences of travel parking and the like simply cannot meet and we're all acutely aware what's it gonna mean in the future when we asked someone to pay $100 for a symphony opera or ballet ticket when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the Internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free these are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain but as particular as they feel to us we know we're not alone all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and communications a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry the magazine industry the book and publishing industry and more saddled in the Performing Arts as we are by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction in streaming locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues where we charge exorbitant prices many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves are we next everyone I talked to in performing arts resonates to the world of aid words of Adrian rich who in dreams of a common language wrote we are out in a country that has no language no laws whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they gave us are out-of-date by years and for those of you who love the arts aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day now rather than saying that we're a bit brink of our own annihilation I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental Reformation a Reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century the arts Reformation like the religious Reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed the printing press really leading the charge on the religious and Reformation both Reformation czar predicated on fractious discussion internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models and at heart both Reformation I think we're asking the questions who's entitled to practice how are they entitled to practice and indeed do we need anyone to inter mediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine Chris Anderson someone I trust you all know editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and author of the long tale really was the first for me to nail a lot of this he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet web cell a web technology minicams and more the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history in the 1930s if any of you wanted to make a movie you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more and now who in this room doesn't know a 14-year old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the 30s Warner Brothers RKO did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market a time when anyone is a potential author frankly what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations this group others have called the pro Am's amateur artists doing work at a professional level you see them on YouTube and dance competitions film festivals and more they are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions ultimately we now live in a world defined not by consumption but by participation but I want to be clear just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal church or to the priesthood I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community as by far too short-sighted and indeed while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional the single most exciting development in the last five to ten years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women's rights or human rights around global warming issues or AIDS relief or more not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada but by Liz Lerman's dance exchange a multi-generational professional dance company whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN today's professional theater community is defined not only by the Shah and Stratford festivals but by the cornerstone Theatre of Los Angeles a collective of artists that after nine Levin brought together ten different religious communities the Baha'i the Catholic the Muslim the Jewish even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross community healing today's performers like we're deaf salons work in women's prisons helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs do you find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more and indeed I think rather than being annihilated the Performing Arts are poised on the brink of a time where we will be more important than we have ever been you know we've said for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy dollars spent in restaurants from parking at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes the piano tuner who chooses the instruments and more but the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward especially in industries we can't even imagine yet just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries which few if any of us could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence the ability to listen deeply to have empathy to articulate change to motivate others the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter especially now as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the Arts to shape our individual and national characters and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience ultimately especially now in this world where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws in reality-tv that thrives on humiliation and in its context of announcements where the thing we hear most repeatedly day-in day-out in the United States in every train station every bus station every plane station is ladies and gentlemen please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion the arts whatever they do whenever they call us together invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity god knows if we have ever needed that capacity in human history we need it now you know we're bound together not I think by Technology Entertainment Design but by common cause we work to promote healthy vibrant societies to ameliorate human suffering to promote a more thoughtful subjective empathic World Order I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work whatever your purpose may be I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come and I thank you for your kindness and your patience and listening to me this afternoon thank you and Godspeed

**Transcript**:
Do you have a friend or a sibling that's always competing with you to see who's the fastest? Our alien friends Bleebop and Mark are having the same debate with their custom-built rockets, and they've asked us to be the judge of a space race to their moon. The only problem is that they are starting from different asteroids. Bleebop is on an asteroid 240 miles from the moon, and Mark is on one 150 miles away. Don't worry, it's not rocket science. Solving this equation is as simple as DIRT. We can decide who the winner is using the D=RT formula, or DIRT. This stands for distance equals rate times time. In the case of Bleebop and Mark, we will only know the distance they traveled and the time it took for them to get to the finish line. It'll be up to us to find the rate and who is faster. Let's turn to the race now and see what information we get. Three, two, one, blast off! Bleebop and Mark's rockets go zipping across the galaxy towards their moon, dodging clunky meteorites and loopy space buggies. After a few close calls with a wandering satellite, Mark arrives first in two hours, and Bleebop gets there one hour later. Looks like Mark has the faster rocket, but let's check out the results with our DIRT equation. Begin by setting up a chart. Make four columns and three rows. Use DIRT to remember what to fill in. Each rocket will have information for distance, rate, and time. Mark's rocket went 150 miles, we don't know the rate, and he got there in 2 hours. Bleebop's rocket went 240 miles, we don't know the rate, and the time is 1 hour after Mark, or 3 hours. Because we don't know Mark or Bleebop's rate, that number is going to be a variable in each equation, which we'll represent with x. We'll solve the equation for the variable to find its value. Mark finished first, so start with his rocket. Remembering DIRT, write down D=RT. 150 miles equals x times 2 hours. Divide both sides by 2 hours. This will leave x isolated on the right side of the equation. 150 miles divided by 2 hours is 75 miles over 1 hour. Mark's rate is 75 miles per hour. That's what mph means. It's the amount of miles over one hour. Still think Mark is faster? Let's set up the same equation for Bleebop and see. D=RT 240 miles equals x times 3 hours. Divide both sides by 3 hours. This will leave x isolated on the right side of the equation. 240 miles divided by 3 hours is 80 miles over 1 hour. Bleebop's rate is 80 miles per hour. Wow, even though Bleebop got there one hour later, it turns out he had the faster rocket. Mark seems pretty upset, but with aliens, you can never really tell. Thanks to DIRT, you now know how to calculate distance, rate, and time. In what other situations can you use the distance formula? You don't even need to be watching a space race. As long as you know two pieces of information for the formula D=RT, you can calculate any moving vehicle or object. Now, the next time you're in a car, you can let your friends know exactly when you'll be arriving, how fast you're going, or the distance you'll travel. It's as simple as DIRT.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How do you solve for rate when you know the distance and the time?

Each rocket will have information for distance, rate, and time. Mark's rocket went 150 miles, we don't know the rate, and he got there in 2 hours. Bleebop's rocket went 240 miles, we don't know the rate, and the time is 1 hour after Mark, or 3 hours. Because we don't know Mark or Bleebop's rate, that number is going to be a variable in each equation, which we'll represent with x. We'll solve the equation for the variable to find its value. Mark finished first, so start with his rocket. Remembering DIRT, write down D=RT. 150 miles equals x times 2 hours. Divide both sides by 2 hours. This will leave x isolated on the right side of the equation. 150 miles divided by 2 hours is 75 miles over 1 hour. Mark's rate is 75 miles per hour. That's what mph means. It's the amount of miles over one hour. Still think Mark is faster? Let's set up the same equation for Bleebop and see. D=RT 240 miles equals x times 3 hours. Divide both sides by 3 hours. This will leave x isolated on the right side of the equation. 240 miles divided by 3 hours is 80 miles over 1 hour. Bleebop's rate is 80 miles per hour. Wow, even though Bleebop got there one hour later, it turns out he had the faster rocket. Mark seems pretty upset, but with aliens, you can never really tell. Thanks to DIRT, you now know how to calculate distance, rate, and time. In what other situations can you use the distance formula? You don't even need to be watching a space race. As long as you know two pieces of information for the formula D=RT, you can calculate any moving vehicle or object. Now, the next time you're in a car, you can let your friends know exactly when you'll be arriving, how fast you're going, or the distance you'll travel. It's as simple as DIRT.

**Transcript**:
If you live on the east coast
of the United States, you've spent the last
17 years of your life walking, eating and sleeping above a dormant army of insects. These are the cicadas. Every 17 years, billions of them emerge
from the ground to do three things: molt, mate and die. There are 15 different broods
of cicadas out there, grouped by when they'll emerge
from the ground. Some of these broods
are on a 13-year cycle, others are on a 17-year clock. Either way, the cicadas live underground
for most of their lives, feeding on the juices of plant roots. When it's time to emerge, the adults begin to burrow
their way out of the ground and up to the surface, where they'll live for just a few weeks. During these weeks, though, everybody will know
the cicadas have arrived. There will be billions of them. And they're loud. Male cicadas band together
to call for female mates, and their collective chorus
can reach up to 100 decibels -- as loud as a chain saw. In fact, if you happen to be using
a chain saw or a lawn mower, male cicadas will flock to you, thinking that you're one of them. Now, like most things in nature, the cicadas don't arrive without a posse. There are all sort of awesome
and gross predators and parasites that come along with the buzzing bugs. Take the fungus Massospora for example. This little white fungus buries itself
in the cicada's abdomen and eats the bug alive, leaving behind its spores. When those spores rupture, they burst out of the still-alive cicada, turning the bug into a flying
saltshaker of death, raining spores down upon
its unsuspecting cicada neighbors. But while we know pretty precisely when the cicadas will arrive
and fade away, we're still not totally certain of why. There are certain advantages to having your entire species
emerge at once, of course. The sheer number of cicadas
coming out of the ground is so overwhelming to predators,
it is essentially guaranteed that a few bugs will survive
and reproduce. And since cicadas emerge
every 13 or 17 years, longer than the lifespan
of many of their predators, the animals that eat them don't learn
to depend on their availability. But why 13 and 17 years, instead of 16 or 18 or 12? Well, that part no one really knows. It's possible the number
just happened by chance, or, perhaps, cicadas
really love prime numbers. Eventually, the cicadas
will mate and slowly die off, their call fading into the distance. The eggs they lay
will begin the cycle again, their cicada babies burrowing
into the earth, feeding on plant juice, and waiting for their turn
to darken the skies and fill the air with their songs. In 17 years, they'll be ready. Will you?

and reproduce. And since cicadas emerge
every 13 or 17 years, longer than the lifespan
of many of their predators, the animals that eat them don't learn
to depend on their availability. But why 13 and 17 years, instead of 16 or 18 or 12? Well, that part no one really knows. It's possible the number
just happened by chance, or, perhaps, cicadas
really love prime numbers. Eventually, the cicadas
will mate and slowly die off, their call fading into the distance. The eggs they lay
will begin the cycle again, their cicada babies burrowing
into the earth, feeding on plant juice, and waiting for their turn
to darken the skies and fill the air with their songs. In 17 years, they'll be ready. Will you?

How's this for a strange idea: a day off from work in honor of work itself? Actually, that is what Labor Day, celebrated in the United States and Canada on the first Monday of every September, is all about. The first American Labor Day was celebrated in New York City on September 5th, 1882, as thousands of workers and their families came to Union Square for a day in the park. It was not a national holiday but had been organized by a union to honor workers and their hard efforts with a rare day of rest, halfway between July 4th and Thanksgiving. There were picnics and a parade, but there were also protests. The workers had gathered, not just to rest and celebrate, but to demand fair wages, the end of child labor, and the right to organize into unions. During the period known as The Industrial Revolution, many jobs were difficult, dirty and dangerous. People worked for twelve hours, six days a week, without fringe benefits, such as vacations, health care and pensions, and if you were young, chances are you were doing manual labor instead of your ABCs and fractions. Children as young as ten worked in some of the most hazardous places, like coal mines or factories filled with boiling vats or dangerous machines. Trying to win better pay, shorter hours and safer conditions workers had begun to form labor unions in America and Canada, but the companies they worked for often fought hard to keep unions out and to supress strikes. At times, this led to violent battles between workers and business owners with the owners often backed up by the police, or even the military. In the following years, the idea of Labor Day caught on in America with official celebrations reaching 30 states. But then came the violent Haymarket Square Riot of 1886, which led to the deaths of several policemen and workers in Chicago and the execution of four union leaders. After that, many labor and political groups around the world had begun to mark Haymarket Square on May 1st, which became known as International Workers' Day. In 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed the law making Labor Day a federal holiday in America, only days after he had sent 12,000 soldiers to end a violent railroad strike that resulted in the death of several people. The original September date was kept, partly to avoid the more radical associations of May 1st. Canada also created its Labor Day in 1894. But, in spite of this new holiday, it would be a long time before the changes that workers wanted became a reality. In 1938, during the Great Depression that left millions without jobs, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a law calling for an eight-hour work day, a five-day work week, and an end to child labor, some of the first federal protections for American workers. As America and Canada celebrate Labor Day, most of the two countries' children enjoy a day off from school. But it is important to remember that there was a time that everyday was a labor day for children in America and Canada, and unfortunately, the same fact remains true for millions of children around the world today.

**Transcript**:
How old is the Earth? Well, by counting the number of isotopes in a sample of rock that's undergone radioactive decay, geologists have estimated the Earth's birthday, when it first formed from a solar nebula, to be 4.6 billion years ago. But just how long is that really? Here's some analogies that might help you understand. For example, let's imagine the entire history of Earth until the present day as a single calendar year. On January 1st, the Earth begins to form. By March 3rd, there's the first evidence of single-celled bacteria. Life remains amazingly unicellular until November 11th when the first multicellular organisms, known as the Ediacaran fauna, come along. Shortly thereafter, on November 16th at 6:08 p.m. is the Cambrian Explosion of life, a major milestone, when all of the modern phyla started to appear. On December 10th at 1:26 p.m., the dinosaurs first evolve but are wiped out by an asteroid just two weeks later. On December 31st, the mighty Roman empire rises and falls in just under four seconds. And Columbus sets sail for what he thinks is India at three seconds to midnight. If you try to write the history of the Earth using just one page per year, your book would be 145 miles thick, more than half the distance to the international space station. The story of the 3.2 million year-old Australopithecine fossil known as Lucy would be found on the 144th mile, just over 500 feet from the end of the book. The United States of America's Declaration of Independence would be signed in the last half-inch. Or if we compared geologic time to a woman stretching her arms to a span of six feet, the simple act of filing her nails would wipe away all of recorded human history. Finally, let's imagine the history of the Earth as your life: from the moment you're born to your first day of high school. Your first word, first time sitting up, and first time walking would all take place while life on Earth was comprised of single-celled organisms. In fact, the first multicellular organism wouldn't evolve until you were 12 years old and starting 7th grade, right around the time your science teacher is telling the class how fossils are formed. The dinosaurs don't appear until three months into 8th grade and are soon wiped out right around spring break. Three days before 9th grade begins, when you realize summer is over and you need new school supplies, Lucy, the Australopithecine, is walking around Africa. As you finish breakfast and head outside to catch your bus 44 minutes before school, the Neanderthals are going extinct throughout Europe. The most recent glacial period ends as your bus drops you off 16 minutes before class. Columbus sets sail 50 seconds before class as you're still trying to find the right classroom. The Declaration of Independence is signed 28 seconds later as you look for an empty seat. And you were born 1.3 seconds before the bell rings. So, you see, the Earth is extremely, unbelievably old compared to us humans with a fossil record hiding incredible stories to tell us about the past and possibly the future as well. But in the short time we've been here, we've learned so much and will surely learn more over the next decades and centuries, near moments in geological time.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Geologically speaking with reference to the entire history of the earth, the dinosaurs went extinct…

**Transcript**:
How old is the Earth? Well, by counting the number of isotopes in a sample of rock that's undergone radioactive decay, geologists have estimated the Earth's birthday, when it first formed from a solar nebula, to be 4.6 billion years ago. But just how long is that really? Here's some analogies that might help you understand. For example, let's imagine the entire history of Earth until the present day as a single calendar year. On January 1st, the Earth begins to form. By March 3rd, there's the first evidence of single-celled bacteria. Life remains amazingly unicellular until November 11th when the first multicellular organisms, known as the Ediacaran fauna, come along. Shortly thereafter, on November 16th at 6:08 p.m. is the Cambrian Explosion of life, a major milestone, when all of the modern phyla started to appear. On December 10th at 1:26 p.m., the dinosaurs first evolve but are wiped out by an asteroid just two weeks later. On December 31st, the mighty Roman empire rises and falls in just under four seconds. And Columbus sets sail for what he thinks is India at three seconds to midnight. If you try to write the history of the Earth using just one page per year, your book would be 145 miles thick, more than half the distance to the international space station. The story of the 3.2 million year-old Australopithecine fossil known as Lucy would be found on the 144th mile, just over 500 feet from the end of the book. The United States of America's Declaration of Independence would be signed in the last half-inch. Or if we compared geologic time to a woman stretching her arms to a span of six feet, the simple act of filing her nails would wipe away all of recorded human history. Finally, let's imagine the history of the Earth as your life: from the moment you're born to your first day of high school. Your first word, first time sitting up, and first time walking would all take place while life on Earth was comprised of single-celled organisms. In fact, the first multicellular organism wouldn't evolve until you were 12 years old and starting 7th grade, right around the time your science teacher is telling the class how fossils are formed. The dinosaurs don't appear until three months into 8th grade and are soon wiped out right around spring break. Three days before 9th grade begins, when you realize summer is over and you need new school supplies, Lucy, the Australopithecine, is walking around Africa. As you finish breakfast and head outside to catch your bus 44 minutes before school, the Neanderthals are going extinct throughout Europe. The most recent glacial period ends as your bus drops you off 16 minutes before class. Columbus sets sail 50 seconds before class as you're still trying to find the right classroom. The Declaration of Independence is signed 28 seconds later as you look for an empty seat. And you were born 1.3 seconds before the bell rings. So, you see, the Earth is extremely, unbelievably old compared to us humans with a fossil record hiding incredible stories to tell us about the past and possibly the future as well. But in the short time we've been here, we've learned so much and will surely learn more over the next decades and centuries, near moments in geological time.

Finally, let's imagine the history of the Earth as your life: from the moment you're born to your first day of high school. Your first word, first time sitting up, and first time walking would all take place while life on Earth was comprised of single-celled organisms. In fact, the first multicellular organism wouldn't evolve until you were 12 years old and starting 7th grade, right around the time your science teacher is telling the class how fossils are formed. The dinosaurs don't appear until three months into 8th grade and are soon wiped out right around spring break. Three days before 9th grade begins, when you realize summer is over and you need new school supplies, Lucy, the Australopithecine, is walking around Africa. As you finish breakfast and head outside to catch your bus 44 minutes before school, the Neanderthals are going extinct throughout Europe. The most recent glacial period ends as your bus drops you off 16 minutes before class. Columbus sets sail 50 seconds before class as you're still trying to find the right classroom. The Declaration of Independence is signed 28 seconds later as you look for an empty seat. And you were born 1.3 seconds before the bell rings. So, you see, the Earth is extremely, unbelievably old compared to us humans with a fossil record hiding incredible stories to tell us about the past and possibly the future as well. But in the short time we've been here, we've learned so much and will surely learn more over the next decades and centuries, near moments in geological time.

**Transcript**:
Without a doubt, the most exciting scientific observation of 2012 was the discovery of a new particle at the CERN laboratory that could be the Higgs boson, a particle named after physicist Peter Higgs. The Higgs Field is thought to give mass to fundamental, subatomic particles like the quarks and leptons that make up ordinary matter. The Higgs bosons are wiggles in the field, like the bump you see when you twitch a rope. But how does this field give mass to particles? If this sounds confusing to you, you're not alone. In 1993, the British Science Minister challenged physicists to invent a simple way to understand all this Higgs stuff. The prize was a bottle of quality champagne. The winning explanation went something like this: Suppose there's a large cocktail party at the CERN laboratory filled with particle physics researchers. This crowd of physicists represents the Higgs field. If a tax collector entered the party, nobody would want to talk to them, and they could very easily cross the room to get to the bar. The tax collector wouldn't interact with the crowd in much the same way that some particles don't interact with the Higgs field. The particles that don't interact, like photons for example, are called massless. Now, suppose that Peter Higgs entered the same room, perhaps in search of a pint. In this case, the physicists will immediately crowd around Higgs to discuss with him their efforts to measure the properties of his namesake boson. Because he interacts strongly with the crowd, Higgs will move slowly across the room. Continuing our analogy, Higgs has become a massive particle through his interactions with the field. So, if that's the Higgs field, how does the Higgs boson fit into all of this? Let's pretend our crowd of party goers is uniformly spread across the room. Now suppose someone pops their head in the door to report a rumor of a discovery at some distant, rival laboratory. People near the door will hear the rumor, but people far away won't, so they'll move closer to the door to ask. This will create a clump in the crowd. As people have heard the rumor, they will return to their original positions to discuss its implications, but people further away will then ask what's going on. The result will be a clump in the crowd that moves across the room. This clump is analogous to the Higgs boson. It is important to remember that it is not that massive particles interact more with the Higgs field. In our analogy of the party, all particles are equal until they enter the room. Both Peter Higgs and the tax collector have zero mass. It is the interaction with the crowd that causes them to gain mass. I'll say that again. Mass comes from interactions with a field. So, let's recap. A particle gets more or less mass depending on how it interacts with a field, just like different people will move through the crowd at different speeds depending on their popularity. And the Higgs boson is just a clump in the field, like a rumor crossing the room. Of course, this analogy is just that -- an analogy, but it's the best analogy anyone has come up with so far. So, that's it. That's what the Higgs Field and the Higgs boson is all about. Continuing research will tell us if we found it, and the reward will probably be more than just a bottle of champagne.

**Transcript**:
Without a doubt, the most exciting scientific observation of 2012 was the discovery of a new particle at the CERN laboratory that could be the Higgs boson, a particle named after physicist Peter Higgs. The Higgs Field is thought to give mass to fundamental, subatomic particles like the quarks and leptons that make up ordinary matter. The Higgs bosons are wiggles in the field, like the bump you see when you twitch a rope. But how does this field give mass to particles? If this sounds confusing to you, you're not alone. In 1993, the British Science Minister challenged physicists to invent a simple way to understand all this Higgs stuff. The prize was a bottle of quality champagne. The winning explanation went something like this: Suppose there's a large cocktail party at the CERN laboratory filled with particle physics researchers. This crowd of physicists represents the Higgs field. If a tax collector entered the party, nobody would want to talk to them, and they could very easily cross the room to get to the bar. The tax collector wouldn't interact with the crowd in much the same way that some particles don't interact with the Higgs field. The particles that don't interact, like photons for example, are called massless. Now, suppose that Peter Higgs entered the same room, perhaps in search of a pint. In this case, the physicists will immediately crowd around Higgs to discuss with him their efforts to measure the properties of his namesake boson. Because he interacts strongly with the crowd, Higgs will move slowly across the room. Continuing our analogy, Higgs has become a massive particle through his interactions with the field. So, if that's the Higgs field, how does the Higgs boson fit into all of this? Let's pretend our crowd of party goers is uniformly spread across the room. Now suppose someone pops their head in the door to report a rumor of a discovery at some distant, rival laboratory. People near the door will hear the rumor, but people far away won't, so they'll move closer to the door to ask. This will create a clump in the crowd. As people have heard the rumor, they will return to their original positions to discuss its implications, but people further away will then ask what's going on. The result will be a clump in the crowd that moves across the room. This clump is analogous to the Higgs boson. It is important to remember that it is not that massive particles interact more with the Higgs field. In our analogy of the party, all particles are equal until they enter the room. Both Peter Higgs and the tax collector have zero mass. It is the interaction with the crowd that causes them to gain mass. I'll say that again. Mass comes from interactions with a field. So, let's recap. A particle gets more or less mass depending on how it interacts with a field, just like different people will move through the crowd at different speeds depending on their popularity. And the Higgs boson is just a clump in the field, like a rumor crossing the room. Of course, this analogy is just that -- an analogy, but it's the best analogy anyone has come up with so far. So, that's it. That's what the Higgs Field and the Higgs boson is all about. Continuing research will tell us if we found it, and the reward will probably be more than just a bottle of champagne.

**Transcript**:
Some of the issues that are important if you want to have people in space for long periods of time. One is that people will tend to lose bone and muscle mass. We know this. If you have to put a cast on your leg, and you take the cast off after a few weeks, you'll see that your muscles have shrunk in size. And if you measured the bone strength, you'd also see that might have gone down a little bit, too. And so, it's very interesting that our body has that ability to adapt to the loads that are put on it, so that bones and muscles aren't static, they're always changing. While we think of bone as being a solid thing that doesn't change very much, it changes too. And it turns out that in weightlessness, you lose bone. And then you also cause the muscles that work against gravity, what are called the postural muscles, they'll start to shrink and lose strength. There are other things in the cardiovascular system, the heart and blood vessels. And if you think about it, standing up in gravity means you have to work against gravity in order to keep blood pumping to your head. So, if you couldn't keep blood pumping in the head, you'd pass out every time you stood up because when you're lying down, you don't have to push against gravity. But when you stand up, you got to work against gravity to keep blood flowing to your head. And your heart and blood vessels have a really nicely worked-out system to make that happen every time. But that system can also change in weightlessness. And then the other area that changes is the system that has to do with balance. Again, maintaining your balance is something that you're doing against gravity, right? If you didn't have gravity present, you wouldn't have to worry about falling. But you obviously do have to worry about falling, and we have a very highly developed sense of balance to keep us upright and to prevent us from falling. And when you see what skaters do, you realize just how exquisite a system it is. But when you go into weightlessness, your balance system changes. You don't really notice it while you are in weightlessness, but when you come back, you do notice it, that your balance has changed and you have a little bit of trouble maintaining your balance. And what it shows is that while you're in space, your brain is trying to allow you to function in weightlessness. And so, it re-adapts you to be weightless, which you don't notice until you come back and find out that you're now back on Earth with a balance system that's been adapted to space. You know, all life developed here on Earth with gravity being present, so life evolved under the influence of gravity, and then we grow up with gravity being present, so we learn how to walk and catch a ball and ice skate or whatever, all with gravity being present. And what if you were to grow up without gravity? What about the systems that depend on gravity, like your muscles or your balance system or the heart and blood vessels? Would they develop normally, or would they be different in some way? One reason why you might think that it would go down a different pathway is from an experiment that was done some time ago by two neuroscientists called Hubel and Wiesel. And what they did is they had a kitten, and they put a patch over the eye of the kitten. And then the kitten grew up to be a cat, and they removed the patch. And so, the question is, can the cat see out of that eye? Now, there's nothing wrong with the eye, right? But it just hasn't seen anything, there hasn't been any light coming in. And the answer is that the cat can't see out of that eye because what happens is that the brain goes down a different pathway when it develops and the connections that would ordinarily develop to that eye don't develop. And that can't be undone, that's a permanent change. So, the brain of that cat is fundamentally different from the brain of a cat that grew up seeing out of that eye. That cat grew up with a different brain, in essence. So, then you wonder, well, what about gravity? What if you don't have the forces that gravity produces? Is your balance organ going to develop in the same way, or will it be different? If somebody grew up in space, could they come back to Earth and function, or would they really be a different person?

**Transcript**:
Some of the issues that are important if you want to have people in space for long periods of time. One is that people will tend to lose bone and muscle mass. We know this. If you have to put a cast on your leg, and you take the cast off after a few weeks, you'll see that your muscles have shrunk in size. And if you measured the bone strength, you'd also see that might have gone down a little bit, too. And so, it's very interesting that our body has that ability to adapt to the loads that are put on it, so that bones and muscles aren't static, they're always changing. While we think of bone as being a solid thing that doesn't change very much, it changes too. And it turns out that in weightlessness, you lose bone. And then you also cause the muscles that work against gravity, what are called the postural muscles, they'll start to shrink and lose strength. There are other things in the cardiovascular system, the heart and blood vessels. And if you think about it, standing up in gravity means you have to work against gravity in order to keep blood pumping to your head. So, if you couldn't keep blood pumping in the head, you'd pass out every time you stood up because when you're lying down, you don't have to push against gravity. But when you stand up, you got to work against gravity to keep blood flowing to your head. And your heart and blood vessels have a really nicely worked-out system to make that happen every time. But that system can also change in weightlessness. And then the other area that changes is the system that has to do with balance. Again, maintaining your balance is something that you're doing against gravity, right? If you didn't have gravity present, you wouldn't have to worry about falling. But you obviously do have to worry about falling, and we have a very highly developed sense of balance to keep us upright and to prevent us from falling. And when you see what skaters do, you realize just how exquisite a system it is. But when you go into weightlessness, your balance system changes. You don't really notice it while you are in weightlessness, but when you come back, you do notice it, that your balance has changed and you have a little bit of trouble maintaining your balance. And what it shows is that while you're in space, your brain is trying to allow you to function in weightlessness. And so, it re-adapts you to be weightless, which you don't notice until you come back and find out that you're now back on Earth with a balance system that's been adapted to space. You know, all life developed here on Earth with gravity being present, so life evolved under the influence of gravity, and then we grow up with gravity being present, so we learn how to walk and catch a ball and ice skate or whatever, all with gravity being present. And what if you were to grow up without gravity? What about the systems that depend on gravity, like your muscles or your balance system or the heart and blood vessels? Would they develop normally, or would they be different in some way? One reason why you might think that it would go down a different pathway is from an experiment that was done some time ago by two neuroscientists called Hubel and Wiesel. And what they did is they had a kitten, and they put a patch over the eye of the kitten. And then the kitten grew up to be a cat, and they removed the patch. And so, the question is, can the cat see out of that eye? Now, there's nothing wrong with the eye, right? But it just hasn't seen anything, there hasn't been any light coming in. And the answer is that the cat can't see out of that eye because what happens is that the brain goes down a different pathway when it develops and the connections that would ordinarily develop to that eye don't develop. And that can't be undone, that's a permanent change. So, the brain of that cat is fundamentally different from the brain of a cat that grew up seeing out of that eye. That cat grew up with a different brain, in essence. So, then you wonder, well, what about gravity? What if you don't have the forces that gravity produces? Is your balance organ going to develop in the same way, or will it be different? If somebody grew up in space, could they come back to Earth and function, or would they really be a different person?
