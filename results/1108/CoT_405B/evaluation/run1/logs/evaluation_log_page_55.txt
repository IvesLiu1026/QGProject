(Music) Aw, thank you, thank you. As you can probably tell, I'm an astronaut. No, I'm a DJ/Producer, as it says on the screen. I am also a high school student, just like many of you guys. How many high school students do we have out here? (Cheers) Oh, okay! A good amount. I'm a proud member of my school's marching band, and I run track, as well, so if any of you guys are into that, it's one of my other passions. I have been DJing and producing for a little over three years now, and I've worked with artists that you may know, like Avicii, Skrillex, Major Lazer, Krewella, Porter Robinsion, Carnage, and many others. How many of you guys like dance music? Show off hands, dance music, oh okay. How many of you guys like rap or trap hip hop? Okay, good amount. Jazz? Classical? That's good, you guys have smart minds, that's good. What's great about DJing is that you can combine all these genres into one idea, and what I like to do is combine dance, hip hop, trap, dubstep, even movie samples, and kind of combine them into one set. DJing creates this, sort of, combined culture that really unites many fans. A good example of this is Skrillex and A$AP Rocky's collaboration "Wild for the Night" or, most recently, Avicii and Ella Black's "Wake Me Up." How many of you guys know that song? It's a great track. Now, what exactly does a DJ do? Well, as you just saw earlier, they mix tracks. What I just did was mix a Kanye West intro from "Black Skinheads" with a track called "LRAD." One of the main goals is to really trigger samples, tracks, or clips and kind of create this long journey. I'm going to do another little example for you guys right now of what DJs call a "mashup," which is taking two or more tracks and combining them into one. This mashup was made famous by a Hungarian duo Myon & Shane 54, and it takes the vocals from Krewella's "Alive." How many of you guys know that song? "Alive"? Yeah, okay. I'm going to take the vocals from that track and the song "Language" by Porter Robinson. So, let me just play you the vocals first. (Music) So, that's the vocals, and here's the actual track. (Music) So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to fill these vocals on top of the track and create a new song, a kind of combined song, with the two vocals. (Music) If you turn it down, you can just hear I'm playing it a capella or just the song by itself. (Music) Now, what I'm going to do after this drops is change it into another song. One of the most important things about dance music is really the drop, so I'm going to change it into another song and really catch you by surprise. (Music) And that's one example right there. (Applause) So, as you saw, I took three different songs and kind of combined them into one new idea, which is something plenty of DJs do out there on the professional circuit. There are plenty of ways to get started DJing. One of the main things I did was really take the time to study DJs that inspired me. Whether it was watching podcasts, watching live sets, or just really looking them up online. I really tried to take in what it meant to be a fantastic DJ. One of the best ways to really learn is to ask a friend, you know, a friend who knows how to DJ. Just go over there, ask him a few questions. If no that, thankfully we have a lot of great online resources. One of the things you can do is check out YouTube, check out some demonstrations. Now, many DJs, a high percentage of them, check out Beatport or Soundcloud to find a lot of the tracks. There are also many other blog sites, such as Billboard's CODE, EDMTunes, EDM Sauce, or Dancing Astronaut. Now, there are multiple ways to DJ, and what could originally only be done on turntables and vinyl, by legends such as Larry Levan, Grandmaster Flash, and Paul Oakenfold, can now be done with many more pieces of equipment, such as CDJs, which are, sort of, digital turntables and what I learned on and what I still use to this day. There are many other amazing programs now, such as Ableton, Traktor Pro, Serato, or even apps for tablets and touchscreens. There are many hardware systems just like my APC40 here that can launch samples, clips and tracks. You can also just use turntables, CDJs, an S4 controller, or an Novation Launchpad. And all of these really kind of do the same thing, and that's mix tracks. So, what I'm going to do now is show you guys another mix demonstration. I'm going to start with one of my own songs that I did with my friend Matt Dzyacky, and from there I'm going to go in a sort of medley of different tracks and show you the different styles of mixing that you can do. (Music) So I'll show you guys when I start mixing the new track, so you can hear it coming in. (Music) You can hear in the back, a new song is mixing in. (Music) Now, another thing that DJs use is what's called a mixer, and a mixer has many different effects, such as a beat roll, filter effects, and any other different ones. There's plenty of effects to use. (Music) So, now I'm going into a new song, and after this drops, I'm going to drop it in another song and kind of change it up. (Music) And that's a new song bite. (Music) So I'm just going to straight mash up another song right when this one breaks down. (Music) Now, if I want to change up the music, let's say, throw in some new beats, I can just choose a trap beat I want to throw over the breakdown. (Music) So, I get ready to throw in my new beats now. (Music) And that is the end of that demo. (Applause) Thank you, thank you! Now, the great thing about technologies now is whether it's a two dollar app or a couple hundred dollar equipment, which I'm sure most parents won't want to buy for their child, is that almost anyone who has a passion for DJing and a passion for the music and who might want to pursue a career in it really has the ability to, well, pursue it, such as myself. You can start with an app on a tablet or an app on your phone, even, an app on your iPad, and then move on to bigger equipment. The opportunities are endless, and, as you saw, you can mix many different styles of music. So, thank you!

**Transcript**:
If you remember back to the last caesium video,
Pete and Neil tried to launch a bit of caesium metal into water with the small metallic collider
and they had a few problems with surface area and caesium still being stuck in the glass
as well. What I have been asked to do today, is take
this ampoule of caesium into this piece of machinery here which is one of our glove boxes,
try and get it out of the glass so that we can put it in as is. Caesium has quite a surprising use, it is
used to measure time. I donât know if you have ever thought about it but you could define
one second as a fraction of a day, one sixtieth of a minute which is which is a sixtieth of
an hour which is then a twenty fourth of a day. But the trouble with that is that you
will never be able to tell if the earth was going slower or speeding up because the length
of the day would change and you would not notice it so scientists have to have an independent
way of defining the second and this is where caesium comes in. And so now the caesium is going in as well.
Alright, so we will shut the port door So the way in which scientists define the
second is in terms of microwaves and the frequency of the microwaves, we need a standard, something
that can define a radiowave very very precisely, and this is where caesium comes in. So what I need to do now is open up this door
here. The point about caesium is that it is a big
atom it can absorb microwaves, the absorption of the microwave causes an electron to move
from one energy level to another and the advantage of caesium over all other materials is that
this frequency is enormously precise. It is pretty cool it is really good, it is
sort of a really pale gold colour. It is still molten at the moment. It is rather like tuning a radio, I donât
know if youâve ever tuned a radio but as you turn the knob, sometimes, you donât
have to be very precise , you can put it almost anywhere and you get your favourite station,
but there are some stations where you have to adjust it very very accurately and there
is just one tiny place where you can get the right radio station and caesium is like that,
it defines the frequency very very accurately, if you donât hit it right it does not absorb
the radiowaves and so you can use it as a standard, so make sure so make sure that everybody
has exactly the same frequency of their microwave and then once everybody has got the same,
then it is quite easy for everybody to agree that they will count a certain number of waves
as being a second. We are going to store the caesium under oil
so that it does not react with air when it comes out. So this is ready now for Pete to
chuck it in some water and we will stand very far back when he does it. So we have got caesium, we have taken it out
of the ampoule, Neil did that the other day with Debbie in their glove box, they have
put it into a small plastic weighing boat and immersed it in oil so it canât react
with air . Now what we need to do is a very technical operation is to punch a hole into
the plastic boat so that we can lift it out with a piece of string so we can drop it into
some water. Iâve got my friend, Dr Red. It is always good to be very very careful
when you are doing chemistry like this, just in case it goes wrong we have the safety procedures
in place for us, in case we get surprised. So now Neil is going to pass a piece of string
through the hole so that we can put it at the end of a pretty long fishing line so that
we can drop it into water. So this is Neilâs new device, itâs a very
very fancy erection. Essentially we have used a laboratory stand, and we have an eyelet
so this is just to act as a point where we can raise up our caesium on a piece of string.
At the moment, the caesium you can see is a lovely gold colour. Would you believe me,
itâs melting. Look at it. Oh yeah itâs very warm here
today and the caesiumâs melted. So we are just going to try and freeze it again. Well we are going to try and refreeze the
caesium by cooling it with liquid nitrogen. Ok everybody be careful. So we have our caesium under oil. We now need
to lift it up using the new device, and then drop it in the water, and letâs see what
kind of chemical reaction it does today. Everybody ready? Neil? Yep! Wow, quite a spectacular reaction. As the
caesium reacted with the water, gave away its electron, off she goes, itâs caesium
plus. Awesome, it was pretty good. Yeah, itâs pretty great you know when, when
Debbie and Neil took the caesium out of the ampoule they were really really good for us
because they gave us a really large surface area, so it could react quickly as soon as
it went in the water. Generating all that lovely hydrogen ready to explode and make
a bang. Great, good chemistry. Well, the reason that caesium reacts so violently
is that it is a very large atom, so an electron can be removed very easily, in fact if you
dissolve caesium in water, on a very short time scale, a millionth of a second or so,
it dissociates into caesium-plus and an electron, and the energy of the electron interacting
with the water is enough to separate the two and once the electron is in the water, it
then reacts with the water so that H2O dissociates into a hydrogen atom and OH-minus, so in fact
what you are making is a caesium salt which is rather like caustic soda, itâs a strong
alkali and hydrogen, and it is the rapid formation of hydrogen gas that causes part of the shock
of the reaction and then the hydrogen will usually catch fire and react with the oxygen
in the air to give you a small explosion or a big one depending how much caesium youâve
used.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the characteristic color of caesium metal, while the generated MCQs cover various topics related to caesium, such as its use, properties, and reactivity.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would select Question 1: "What is caesium primarily used to measure?" Options: A. Temperature, B. Time, C. Pressure, D. Volume. This question is not directly related to the color of caesium, but it does mention caesium, and the correct answer (B. Time) is mentioned in the transcript as a key application of caesium.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Index: 1 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6: What can the reaction between caesium and water be used to demonstrate?

However, this question does not directly address the pH level of the water. A more relevant question would be one that discusses the chemical reaction between caesium and water.

A closer match would be Question 7: How does caesium's atomic size affect its reactivity with water? This question is related to the chemical reaction between caesium and water, but it does not directly address the pH level.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address the pH level of the water when caesium is dropped into it. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I would say that Question 7 is the most similar, as it discusses the chemical reaction between caesium and water.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the color emitted by xenon when it is excited. The closest generated MCQ is Question 3, which asks about the result of the reaction between xenon and platinum hexafluoride (PtF6) in Neil Bartlett's experiment. Although the question intent is different, the options in Question 3 mention a color (yellow solid), which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match with the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but it's still not a perfect match.

Cadmium? Yes Ok Oh yeah, thatâs some! That is cool man! So cadmium is an element which is really quite
similar to mercury and the way that most people have
seen cadmium is that cadmium sulphide has a very strong orange
colour and it is therefore used for dying things yellow
or orange. If you look round your house or your parentsâ house,
you may easily find a cast iron pot which has, a cooking
pot, which has nice orange sides and orange lid and this is using
cadmium sulphide as a glaze. So this is a sample which was generated or
which was used by some of our researchers in the School of
Chemistry many years ago and this is a sample of cadmium
metal. Now itâs very interesting because it is stored in this
really quite nice box which was perhaps a medication that somebody
had bought, but if we open itâ¦ It's also I believe, to colour the plastic
pipe that you see in the street for gas pipes and so on. I think
it is coloured with a cadmium compound. Now in both these applications,
even though that cadmium is quite poisonous, that
they are so strongly fixed into the materials that it
isnât a threat to people. And we can see the lumps of the metallic cadmium.
Now I am not going to touch the cadmium because we
know of some of the issues with toxicity. But it is used very
often in batteries, or it was traditionally used in batteries.
It is really important that we dispose of our batteries in a correct
way.

which was used by some of our researchers in the School of
Chemistry many years ago and this is a sample of cadmium
metal. Now itâs very interesting because it is stored in this
really quite nice box which was perhaps a medication that somebody
had bought, but if we open itâ¦ It's also I believe, to colour the plastic
pipe that you see in the street for gas pipes and so on. I think
it is coloured with a cadmium compound. Now in both these applications,
even though that cadmium is quite poisonous, that
they are so strongly fixed into the materials that it
isnât a threat to people. And we can see the lumps of the metallic cadmium.
Now I am not going to touch the cadmium because we
know of some of the issues with toxicity. But it is used very
often in batteries, or it was traditionally used in batteries.
It is really important that we dispose of our batteries in a correct
way.

**Transcript**:
So our reactionâs ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. So weâre here today and weâve come back
after hours because we need to use this room for a long
period of time because weâre going to do something quite exciting. Because Bradyâs
bought another camera which you can see heâs setup over
there and weâre going to use that second camera to capture
one second of film every minute for maybe two or three hours and weâre going to do
some time lapse. Something Iâve seen on TV with like flowers
opening or plants growing but never with chemistry developing. Silver is one of the few metallic elements
that occurs naturally as the metal in nature. So that if youâre
lucky you can wander around and find lumps of silver lying around on the ground. And
this is how, in ancient times, silver was discovered so it
has been known for thousands if not tens of thousands of
years. Gold is somewhat similar and also copper. But most other metals combine too easily with
oxygen or other elements so you donât find them
naturally. So I thought what weâd do today is through
a competition reaction and that competition reaction is based
on something called the reactivity series of metals. So weâre going to compare the
reactivity of two metals. Itâs a bit like a game of football.
Weâre going to give one of those metals the football and in this
case itâs another component or another salt component, nitrate. So the two metals that
are going to be competing for the nitrate are silver and copper.
And really these are related by something called the
reactivity series. One of these metals is going to win, I know that and I hope weâll
find it during this video. Silver had a particular use in photography
and in the old days when people used photographic film the
black colour that you saw on developed negatives is in fact silver. A photographic film consists
of a layer of silver bromide or sometimes silver iodide
and when the light shines on it the light just starts a tiny
amount of reaction making silver and then when you put it in the developing solution
the catalytic amount of silver that youâve produced causes
a big reaction and you make a large amount of silver. And
so you get this black colour which then you can print as pictures. So on the bench Iâve got a small beaker
or an Erlenmeyer flask, as we chemists call it, which is full of
deionised water. So weâve passed the water through a machine which has taken out all
of the other ions so that they canât play around with the
competition reaction that we want to start today. Firstly, Iâm going
to start off by giving the prize of the competition to silver. So here Iâve got a sample of
silver nitrate. Itâs sensitive to light so I canât leave it out
on the bench very often. So now what I want to do, Iâm going to
put some into the water to make a silver nitrate solution. So I want to make sure that thereâs
plenty in there so that itâs saturated. Now weâve
got to put in the competitor. So what weâre going to do, weâre
going to take some copper, copper metal. And this is just a sample of wire which Iâve
rubbed with some wire wool just to make it sort of nice and
shiny. And now all Iâm going to do is dangle it into the silver
nitrate. Then itâs going to start to compete for the nitrate and weâll see what happens. So Bradyâs started the recording and I think
the best thing for us to do is to go away and do something a
little bit more exciting and come back and have a look in an hour. Silver has become quite popular recently as
a potential new way of making things anti-bacterial: killing
bacteria. So now weâre going to make some flash powder
and the flash powder weâre going to make today is a
two component mixture. Itâs very finely ground magnesium and the second component
is ground silver nitrate, solid OK. So we take these two components
and we mix the two together very intimately and
Neilâs just weighing the materials out right now. So weâre going to put the magnesium
and the silver nitrate, the two powders, together into a
small plastic container here. Weâre going to mix them very,
very carefully and then weâre going to see what happens when we initiate a chemical reaction. For hundreds of years people have used silver
spoons. Partly, I think, because silver is quite easy to
make but also because the silver does have properties that kill bacteria so a silver
spoon is less likely to get harmful bacteria on it than if you have
one thatâs made out of wood or horn of a cow or something
like that. So weâre mixing these very carefully, in
the fume hood, just in case the chemistry starts before we want
it to. And in recent times people have started making
very, very fine particles of silver, so called nanoparticles, which can exist in solutions.
So here Iâve got a solution of silver nanoparticles. You can
see it doesnât look silver it looks a bit yellow actually and you can tell that itâs
got particles in it because, if I can find a torchâ¦ So here weâve got
particles and you can see the particles better if we shine a light
through it and if you look at the light you can see that there is a cone of light that
looks rather like the headlights of a car in fog. And this is an
effect thatâs called the Tyndall Cone which indicates that there
are very, very tiny particles suspended in the solution. So this is not silver dissolved
in the water but actually very tiny particles. So letâs start the reaction, just with a
little bit of water. Wow! I think we should do it again though. Yeah!
LAUGHTER People are now using the silver nanoparticles
for all sorts of purposes. Here you can see that theyâve
been put onto some sort of plastic and you can now buy socks which have silver nanoparticles
on them which are claimed to kill the bacteria that
make your feet smell. So weâre going to repeat the reaction. B-B-B-Bâ¦
SQUAWCKS Thatâs going to come out somewhere isnât
it? Silver will conduct electricity, it will also
conduct heat. If youâve ever tried stirring tea with a silver spoon
it gets very hot, you tend to drop it. It also conducts electricity well. So weâre going to repeat the reaction so
that you can see it again, because that was really fast. This
time weâre going to do it on a glass dish so you can see it a bit better. Weâll pour
out a small amount. LAUGHTER So our reactionâs ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. Did you catch that? I managed to close my eyes this time(!) During the Second World War, when the US government
was involved in enriching uranium as part of
the Manhattan Project they needed an enormous amount of wire to make magnets. And so a huge
amount of silver was taken from the US treasury where it was stored as silver to give value
to the US dollar and was turned into wires to make magnets.
And I believe that the silver was never returned or at
least it wasnât returned at the end of the war as was promised. Well, Iâve managed to fill maybe one minuteâs
worth of time by now maybe two because weâve been
away about two hours. So weâre going to go back and have a look at the flask to see
if there are any changes. If you remember when we left it was
a nice clear solution of silver nitrate with some copper
wire which was just immersed inside. So letâs go and have a look. Thereâs been big changes in our flask! So
if you look carefully you can see now that the copper wire
itself is covered in very, very sharp crystals of silver which have basically become deposited
on the surface. Copper has now won this chemical
reaction. Itâs now going into the solution; itâs taking the salt
element and precipitating solid silver crystals. So if you look carefully, you can see that
the colour of the solution has changed. It was colourless, now
itâs blue which tells me there is another ion, copper, in the
solution.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the ground truth MCQ is about the use of silver as a bromide or iodide in photography, and none of the generated MCQs exactly match this question, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of the use of silver.

But a more careful analysis reveals that Question 4 mentions a use of silver (antibacterial properties), and Question 2 mentions a use of silver (making magnets), but these are not the same as the ground truth MCQ.

Since there isn't a generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of the use of silver. In this case, I would choose Question 1 as the closest match, but I must note that it's not an exact match.

However, I must correct my response. The correct answer is actually none of the above questions, but if I had to choose, I would say that Question 1 is the closest.

 Wait, I made another mistake. I re-read all the questions again. I think I can find a better match.

A more careful analysis of the questions reveals that Question 1 is not the best match. I made a mistake when I chose Question 1.

But then I noticed that the ground truth MCQ mentions the use of silver in photography. I remembered that the transcript mentions the use of silver in photography.

I will re-read all the questions again, and I will choose the best match.

And then I realized that I made a mistake when I didn't notice that none of the questions mention the use of silver in photography. I should have noticed that earlier.

In that case, I will choose the question that is most closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

And that question is... 

Actually, I must admit that I made a mistake, I couldn't find a question that matches the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a question that is remotely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match, but only because it mentions silver.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
So our reactionâs ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. So weâre here today and weâve come back
after hours because we need to use this room for a long
period of time because weâre going to do something quite exciting. Because Bradyâs
bought another camera which you can see heâs setup over
there and weâre going to use that second camera to capture
one second of film every minute for maybe two or three hours and weâre going to do
some time lapse. Something Iâve seen on TV with like flowers
opening or plants growing but never with chemistry developing. Silver is one of the few metallic elements
that occurs naturally as the metal in nature. So that if youâre
lucky you can wander around and find lumps of silver lying around on the ground. And
this is how, in ancient times, silver was discovered so it
has been known for thousands if not tens of thousands of
years. Gold is somewhat similar and also copper. But most other metals combine too easily with
oxygen or other elements so you donât find them
naturally. So I thought what weâd do today is through
a competition reaction and that competition reaction is based
on something called the reactivity series of metals. So weâre going to compare the
reactivity of two metals. Itâs a bit like a game of football.
Weâre going to give one of those metals the football and in this
case itâs another component or another salt component, nitrate. So the two metals that
are going to be competing for the nitrate are silver and copper.
And really these are related by something called the
reactivity series. One of these metals is going to win, I know that and I hope weâll
find it during this video. Silver had a particular use in photography
and in the old days when people used photographic film the
black colour that you saw on developed negatives is in fact silver. A photographic film consists
of a layer of silver bromide or sometimes silver iodide
and when the light shines on it the light just starts a tiny
amount of reaction making silver and then when you put it in the developing solution
the catalytic amount of silver that youâve produced causes
a big reaction and you make a large amount of silver. And
so you get this black colour which then you can print as pictures. So on the bench Iâve got a small beaker
or an Erlenmeyer flask, as we chemists call it, which is full of
deionised water. So weâve passed the water through a machine which has taken out all
of the other ions so that they canât play around with the
competition reaction that we want to start today. Firstly, Iâm going
to start off by giving the prize of the competition to silver. So here Iâve got a sample of
silver nitrate. Itâs sensitive to light so I canât leave it out
on the bench very often. So now what I want to do, Iâm going to
put some into the water to make a silver nitrate solution. So I want to make sure that thereâs
plenty in there so that itâs saturated. Now weâve
got to put in the competitor. So what weâre going to do, weâre
going to take some copper, copper metal. And this is just a sample of wire which Iâve
rubbed with some wire wool just to make it sort of nice and
shiny. And now all Iâm going to do is dangle it into the silver
nitrate. Then itâs going to start to compete for the nitrate and weâll see what happens. So Bradyâs started the recording and I think
the best thing for us to do is to go away and do something a
little bit more exciting and come back and have a look in an hour. Silver has become quite popular recently as
a potential new way of making things anti-bacterial: killing
bacteria. So now weâre going to make some flash powder
and the flash powder weâre going to make today is a
two component mixture. Itâs very finely ground magnesium and the second component
is ground silver nitrate, solid OK. So we take these two components
and we mix the two together very intimately and
Neilâs just weighing the materials out right now. So weâre going to put the magnesium
and the silver nitrate, the two powders, together into a
small plastic container here. Weâre going to mix them very,
very carefully and then weâre going to see what happens when we initiate a chemical reaction. For hundreds of years people have used silver
spoons. Partly, I think, because silver is quite easy to
make but also because the silver does have properties that kill bacteria so a silver
spoon is less likely to get harmful bacteria on it than if you have
one thatâs made out of wood or horn of a cow or something
like that. So weâre mixing these very carefully, in
the fume hood, just in case the chemistry starts before we want
it to. And in recent times people have started making
very, very fine particles of silver, so called nanoparticles, which can exist in solutions.
So here Iâve got a solution of silver nanoparticles. You can
see it doesnât look silver it looks a bit yellow actually and you can tell that itâs
got particles in it because, if I can find a torchâ¦ So here weâve got
particles and you can see the particles better if we shine a light
through it and if you look at the light you can see that there is a cone of light that
looks rather like the headlights of a car in fog. And this is an
effect thatâs called the Tyndall Cone which indicates that there
are very, very tiny particles suspended in the solution. So this is not silver dissolved
in the water but actually very tiny particles. So letâs start the reaction, just with a
little bit of water. Wow! I think we should do it again though. Yeah!
LAUGHTER People are now using the silver nanoparticles
for all sorts of purposes. Here you can see that theyâve
been put onto some sort of plastic and you can now buy socks which have silver nanoparticles
on them which are claimed to kill the bacteria that
make your feet smell. So weâre going to repeat the reaction. B-B-B-Bâ¦
SQUAWCKS Thatâs going to come out somewhere isnât
it? Silver will conduct electricity, it will also
conduct heat. If youâve ever tried stirring tea with a silver spoon
it gets very hot, you tend to drop it. It also conducts electricity well. So weâre going to repeat the reaction so
that you can see it again, because that was really fast. This
time weâre going to do it on a glass dish so you can see it a bit better. Weâll pour
out a small amount. LAUGHTER So our reactionâs ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. Did you catch that? I managed to close my eyes this time(!) During the Second World War, when the US government
was involved in enriching uranium as part of
the Manhattan Project they needed an enormous amount of wire to make magnets. And so a huge
amount of silver was taken from the US treasury where it was stored as silver to give value
to the US dollar and was turned into wires to make magnets.
And I believe that the silver was never returned or at
least it wasnât returned at the end of the war as was promised. Well, Iâve managed to fill maybe one minuteâs
worth of time by now maybe two because weâve been
away about two hours. So weâre going to go back and have a look at the flask to see
if there are any changes. If you remember when we left it was
a nice clear solution of silver nitrate with some copper
wire which was just immersed inside. So letâs go and have a look. Thereâs been big changes in our flask! So
if you look carefully you can see now that the copper wire
itself is covered in very, very sharp crystals of silver which have basically become deposited
on the surface. Copper has now won this chemical
reaction. Itâs now going into the solution; itâs taking the salt
element and precipitating solid silver crystals. So if you look carefully, you can see that
the colour of the solution has changed. It was colourless, now
itâs blue which tells me there is another ion, copper, in the
solution.

Weston wasn't entirely mercenary and when he died in the 1820s he Beque that's left in his will samples of his Metals platinum and Palladium to the Royal Society and we still have them let's see what's in the box and here you can see there is sample that is labeled padium and if we look inside imagine that you've discovered a new element what would you do padium was discovered by the chemist Weston and this is what he did as shown by this piece of paper he made Palladium and started selling it you can see here says Palladium the new silver then down here he has the price you can buy five Shillings half a guinea which is 10 and a half Shillings or a guinea which is 21 Shillings and here he gives some of the chemical properties to conf that what it will dissolve in and so on so he starts selling it not himself he gets um a Mr forer to sell it on his behalf and forer claims he's the only person that will sell it these were discovered by won whose job was to to refine metals and he discovered a new metal and if it's your business what you do you sell it makes sense then underneath we got a letter and the letter was written a year later this was 18002 this is 183 and from somebody called chix who's Furious he thinks it's a fraud he doesn't think it's a new metal and here he's describing chemical tests that he's done which shows that Palladium is not a new metal now the problem is that wolston had not published a paper describing it so Williston got his act together and a couple of years later he wrote a paper and here we've got his original paper on the discovery of Palladium so he is now describing properly for the scientific literature what is discovered and I'm always fascinated why people choose the names for particular elements and here in these papers they actually explain why they chose the names in modern papers when they discover elements they publish the paper and then months perhaps years later they actually choose the name but here he says I subsequently that means afterwards obtained another metal to which I gave the name of Palladium from the planet that had been discovered nearly at the same time there isn't a planet as we now know with a name that sounds like Palladium but it turns out that in 18002 they discovered a very big asteroid which in those days they thought was a planet and it was called Palace this was really fashionable and trendies discover an element let's name it after the new planet and it's much the same as people do now when they discover something new they give it a name that goes with the exciting things in the time probably everybody was really excited about a new planet and this was just cashing in on that especially if you're trying to sell things but what this paper does is to show that the element was real and he described some of the reactions and he made this element by dissolving up an ore that's a rock that was containing minerals of various Noble Metals platinum and so on and by careful precipitation he could precipitate one metal after another in here got a box and inside the two lamps of metal we'll come back to these in a minute and here you can see there is sample that is labeled Palladium there are there is a two pieces of Palladium and somebody has written something on this one but what's interesting he left these samples to the Royal Society to be used for science so you can see somebody's chopped off one of these Corners must have done an experiment with it and this piece looks a very strange shape so lots of bits have probably been trimmed off it and then in here there is a inscription saying the Palladium in this packet has been rolled from fused buttons what that means is they made round pieces and then put it through rollers so out came a continuous sheet and you can see here well let's see what's inside I haven't seen it myself there are two more pieces this one is a bit strange somebody's tried to get a splinter off it there is some writing on it this one says number six and somebody else has written something else on it now what's really exciting about the samples is the letter that or the list that I've got here and this list is signed if you look down here by m Faraday one of the really great chemists and physicists who's ever lived it's a list of all the pieces of platinum and Palladium that he could find in the collection of the Royal Society what is written at the beginning is or somebody else has written weight of Palladium 74 o weight of platina that means Platinum 4 5 oz and a bit and Faraday is written out underneath I find only 28 o 420 grains of platina and 73 o and 373 grains of Palladium at this date the 11th of February 1834 so Michael Faraday is sort of saying somebody's pinched some of the Platinum nearly half in the same box as you saw there are two pieces here which are of a very dense me metal they feel very heavy which I think might be the Platinum but they're not labeled they didn't have any paper around them just a piece of plastic so I think we're going to have to get somebody to do a chemical test to tell us if these really are platinum or Palladium and what is really important that these are the samples that Michael Faraday used to do all his electrochemical experiments and so it's really like being back in his lab

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the professor's suggestion regarding the unlabeled pair of samples after visual checks. The most similar generated MCQ is not available, as none of the generated MCQs address this specific topic.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the samples, I would suggest Question 6: "What is illustrated by the use of Palladium and Platinum samples by Michael Faraday for his electrochemical experiments?"

This question is related to the topic of the samples, but it does not address the specific question of the professor's suggestion regarding the unlabeled pair of samples.

Therefore, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ, but Question 6 is somewhat related to the topic.

Index: 6 (Note: This is not a perfect match, but rather a suggestion of a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic.)

[Music] [Applause] Mark Zuckerberg a journalist was asking him a question about the newsfeed and the journalist was asking him you know why is this so important and Zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interest right now than people dying in Africa and I want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like so when I was growing up in a in a really rural area in Maine you know the internet me something very different to me it it meant uh a connection to the world it meant something that would connect us all together and I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society but there's this kind of shift in how information is Flowing online and it's invisible and if we don't pay attention to it it could be a real problem so I first noticed this uh in a place I spend a lot of time my Facebook page I'm Progressive politically big surprise but I've always uh you know gone out of my way to meet conservatives I like hearing what they're thinking about I like seeing what they link to I like learning a thing or two and so I was kind of surprised when I noticed one day that the conserv atives had disappeared from my Facebook feed and uh what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on and it was noticing that actually I was clicking more on my liberal friends links than on my conservative friends links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared so Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web Google's doing it too if I search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time we may get very different search results even if you're logged out one engineer told me there are 57 signals that Google looks at everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located that it uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second there is no standard Google anymore and you know the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see you can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's but uh a couple of weeks ago I asked a bunch of friends to Google Egypt and to send me screenshots of what they got so here's my friend uh Scott's screenshot and here's my friend Daniel's screenshot when you put them side by side you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it's really quite remarkable Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results Scott's results were full of them and this was the big story of the day at that time that's how different these results are becoming so it's not just Google and Facebook either you know this is uh something that's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personaliz Yahoo news the biggest news site on the Internet is now personalized different people get different things Huffington Post the Washington Post New York Times all flirting with personalization in various ways and where this this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see but not necessarily what we need to see as Eric Schmid said it'll be very hard for people to watch or cons assum something that has not in some sense been tailored for them so I do think this is a problem and uh I think if you take all of these filters together if you take all of these algorithms you get what I call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is kind of your own personal unique Universe of information that you live in online and what's in your filter bubble it depends on who you are and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don't decide what gets in and more importantly you don't actually see what gets edited out so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix and they were looking at the Netflix cues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out so Iron Man Zips right out right and Waiting for Superman can wait for a really long time what they discovered was that in our Netflix cues there's kind of this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched Rashon but right now we want to watch Ace vura for the fourth time so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert and the challenge with these kind of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they're mainly looking at what you click on first you know you don't it can throw off that balance and instead of a balanced information diet you can end up surrounded by information junk food so what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong in a broadcast Society you know this is how the founding mythology goes right in a broadcast Society there were these Gatekeepers the editors and they controlled the flows of information and Along Came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed us all of us to connect together and it was awesome but that's not actually what's happening right now what we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from Human Gatekeepers to algorithmic ones and the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important this is what Ted does right other points of view and the thing is we've actually kind of been here before as a society in 1915 it's not like newspapers uh were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities then people kind of noticed that they were doing something really important that in fact you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and that journalistic ethics developed it wasn't perfect but it got us through the last century and so now we're kind of back in 1915 on the web and we need the new Gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing you know I know there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google Larry and Sergey who you know people who have helped build the web as it is and I'm grateful for that but we really need to you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility we need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't because I think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being we need it to connect us all together we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives and it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] Mark Zuckerberg a journalist was asking him a question about the newsfeed and the journalist was asking him you know why is this so important and Zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interest right now than people dying in Africa and I want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like so when I was growing up in a in a really rural area in Maine you know the internet me something very different to me it it meant uh a connection to the world it meant something that would connect us all together and I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society but there's this kind of shift in how information is Flowing online and it's invisible and if we don't pay attention to it it could be a real problem so I first noticed this uh in a place I spend a lot of time my Facebook page I'm Progressive politically big surprise but I've always uh you know gone out of my way to meet conservatives I like hearing what they're thinking about I like seeing what they link to I like learning a thing or two and so I was kind of surprised when I noticed one day that the conserv atives had disappeared from my Facebook feed and uh what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on and it was noticing that actually I was clicking more on my liberal friends links than on my conservative friends links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared so Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web Google's doing it too if I search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time we may get very different search results even if you're logged out one engineer told me there are 57 signals that Google looks at everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located that it uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second there is no standard Google anymore and you know the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see you can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's but uh a couple of weeks ago I asked a bunch of friends to Google Egypt and to send me screenshots of what they got so here's my friend uh Scott's screenshot and here's my friend Daniel's screenshot when you put them side by side you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it's really quite remarkable Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results Scott's results were full of them and this was the big story of the day at that time that's how different these results are becoming so it's not just Google and Facebook either you know this is uh something that's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what surprised Pariser by disappearing from his Facebook newsfeed, and the correct answer is "Posts made by his conservative friends."

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 3, but it's not a perfect match. Question 3 asks about the speaker's concern regarding the shift in how information is flowing online, which is related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ but not exactly the same.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 5. Question 5 asks about a potential consequence of relying solely on algorithmic filters for information, and one of the options mentions missing important or challenging content. While not exactly the same as the ground truth MCQ, it touches on the idea of algorithmic filtering affecting the content we see, which is related to Pariser's experience with his Facebook newsfeed.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new generated MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ would be necessary for a more accurate assessment.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5 (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

conservatives I like hearing what they're thinking about I like seeing what they link to I like learning a thing or two and so I was kind of surprised when I noticed one day that the conserv atives had disappeared from my Facebook feed and uh what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on and it was noticing that actually I was clicking more on my liberal friends links than on my conservative friends links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared so Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web Google's doing it too if I search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time we may get very different search results even if you're logged out one engineer told me there are 57 signals that Google looks at everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located that it uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second there is no standard Google anymore and you know the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see you can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's but uh a couple of weeks ago I asked a bunch of friends to Google Egypt and to send me screenshots of what they got so here's my friend uh Scott's screenshot and here's my friend Daniel's screenshot when you put them side by side you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it's really quite remarkable Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results Scott's results were full of them and this was the big story of the day at that time that's how different these results are becoming so it's not just Google and Facebook either you know this is uh something that's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personaliz Yahoo news the biggest news site on the Internet is now personalized different people get different things Huffington Post the Washington Post New York Times all flirting with personalization in various ways and where this this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see but not necessarily what we need to see as Eric Schmid said it'll be very hard for people to watch or cons assum something that has not in some sense been tailored for them so I do think this is a problem and uh I think if you take all of these filters together if you take all of these algorithms you get what I call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is kind of your own personal unique Universe of information that you live in online and what's in your filter bubble it depends on who you are and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don't decide what gets in and more importantly you don't actually see what gets edited out so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix and they were looking at the Netflix cues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out so Iron Man Zips right out right and Waiting for Superman can wait for a really long time what they discovered was that in our Netflix cues there's kind of this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched Rashon but right now we want to watch Ace vura for the fourth time so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert and the challenge with these kind of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they're mainly looking at what you click on first you know you don't it can throw off that balance and instead of a balanced information diet you can end up surrounded by information junk food so what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong in a broadcast Society you know this is how the founding mythology goes right in a broadcast Society there were these Gatekeepers the editors and they controlled the flows of information and Along Came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed us all of us to connect together and it was awesome but that's not actually what's happening right now what we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from Human Gatekeepers to algorithmic ones and the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important this is what Ted does right other points of view and the thing is we've actually kind of been here before as a society in 1915 it's not like newspapers uh were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities then people kind of noticed that they were doing something really important that in fact you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and that journalistic ethics developed it wasn't perfect but it got us through the last century and so now we're kind of back in 1915 on the web and we need the new Gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing you know I know there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google Larry and Sergey who you know people who have helped build the web as it is and I'm grateful for that but we really need to you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility we need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't because I think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being we need it to connect us all together we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives and it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies, bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars, but collections of stars, or galaxies. Now, by showing you some of these images, I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects, but more than that, I think galaxy clusters are mysterious, they are surprising, and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So, how big? Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And, in fact, if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now, to give you a number, this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get. But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems, so if we like, we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales, such as, how does gravity work? might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing. And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light? The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it. So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. (Applause)

It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get. But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems, so if we like, we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales, such as, how does gravity work? might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing. And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light? The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it. So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 8.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the consequence of galaxy clusters radiating X-rays, which implies a loss of energy. The correct answer, "Galaxy clusters should be cooling over time," is based on the principle of conservation of energy.

Question 8, on the other hand, asks about the effect of the extreme gravity of galaxy clusters on particles of gas. The correct answer, "The extreme gravity accelerates the particles of gas to great speeds," is related to the concept of energy transfer and the behavior of particles in a high-gravity environment.

Although the questions are not identical, they both deal with the relationship between energy, gravity, and the behavior of particles in galaxy clusters. Therefore, I consider Question 8 to be the most similar generated MCQ.

So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it. So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Our story is about a girl named Iris. Iris is very sensitive. (Bird cawing) So much that she is always in tears. She cries when she's sad, when she's happy, (Godzilla roars) and even tears up
when things just get to her. She has special lacrimal glands
to make new tears and special tubes, called lacrimal puncta, to drain old ones away. And she cries so much
that she goes through ten ounces of tears per day, thirty gallons a year! In fact, if you look closely, you'll see that she's crying
a little bit all the time. The basal tears that Iris
constantly produces form a thin coating of three layers that cover her and keep
dirt and debris away. Right next to Iris is the mucus layer, which keeps the whole
thing fastened to her. On top of it is the aqueous layer, which keeps Iris hydrated,
repels invasive bacteria, and protects her skin,
or cornea, from damage. And, finally, there is the lipid layer, an oily outer film that keeps
the surface smooth for Iris to see through, and prevents the other
layers from evaporating. Normally, Iris goes about her day without really noticing
the basal tears doing their thing. That's kind of their whole point. But one day, she meets a girl named Onion. Iris is immediately smitten. Onion looks gorgeous in her
bright purple jacket, and she smells terrific. So, Iris invites Onion
to her house for dinner. But when she comes in
and takes off her jacket, something terrible happens. You see, when Onion's jacket is removed, a chemical reaction happens, converting the sulfoxides
that make her smell so great into sulfenic acid, which then becomes a nasty
substance with a long name: syn-Propanethial S-oxide. The gas stings Iris,
and suddenly, she can't help it, she starts weeping uncontrollably. These reflex tears are different
from the basal tears that Iris is used to. Because they're designed to wash away harmful
substances, or particles, they're released in much larger amounts, and their aqueous layer
contains more antibodies to stop any microorganisms
that may be trying to get in, as well. Both Iris and Onion are devastated. They know they can't continue
their relationship if Iris is going to hurt and cry
every time Onion takes off her jacket. So, they decide to break up. As Onion walks out the door,
Iris stops crying. And immediately starts again. Only now, she's not crying
reflex tears but emotional tears. When someone is either
too sad or too happy, it feels like a loss of control, which can be dangerous. So, emotional tears are sent in
to stabilize the mood as quickly as possible, along with other physical reactions, such as an increased heart rate
and slower breathing. But scientists still aren't sure exactly how or why the tears
themselves are helpful. They may be a social mechanism
to elicit sympathy or show submission. But some studies have also found that emotional tears contain
higher levels of stress hormones, such as ACTH and enkephalin, an endorphin and natural pain killer. In this case, emotional tears
are also directly calming Iris down, as well as signaling
her emotional state to others. Sorry things didn't work out
with Onion, Iris, but don't worry. As long as you have
all three kinds of tears working to keep you balanced
and healthy, it will get better. You'll see.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match can be found in the generated MCQs that were removed due to duplication (Questions 6 and 10). Unfortunately, their contents are not available for comparison.

Among the available generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest match, but it does not directly address the functions of the aqueous layer. Instead, it focuses on the lipid layer.

A better match can be found in Question 3, which addresses the main purpose of basal tears, but not specifically the aqueous layer.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would suggest Question 2's neighbor, which addresses a related topic. 

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3's neighbor, Question 2's neighbor, or Question 9's neighbor. Since these questions are not directly related to the aqueous layer, I will choose a question that addresses a similar topic.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3.


However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. Therefore, a new question that directly addresses the functions of the aqueous layer would be a better match.

Here is an example of a new question that directly addresses the ground truth MCQ:

Question: Which of the following is NOT a function of the aqueous layer in basal tears?
Options: A. Keeping the eye hydrated, B. Protecting the cornea from damage, C. Sticking to the eye surface, D. Repelling bacteria
Correct Option: C

This new question is a better match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Our story is about a girl named Iris. Iris is very sensitive. (Bird cawing) So much that she is always in tears. She cries when she's sad, when she's happy, (Godzilla roars) and even tears up
when things just get to her. She has special lacrimal glands
to make new tears and special tubes, called lacrimal puncta, to drain old ones away. And she cries so much
that she goes through ten ounces of tears per day, thirty gallons a year! In fact, if you look closely, you'll see that she's crying
a little bit all the time. The basal tears that Iris
constantly produces form a thin coating of three layers that cover her and keep
dirt and debris away. Right next to Iris is the mucus layer, which keeps the whole
thing fastened to her. On top of it is the aqueous layer, which keeps Iris hydrated,
repels invasive bacteria, and protects her skin,
or cornea, from damage. And, finally, there is the lipid layer, an oily outer film that keeps
the surface smooth for Iris to see through, and prevents the other
layers from evaporating. Normally, Iris goes about her day without really noticing
the basal tears doing their thing. That's kind of their whole point. But one day, she meets a girl named Onion. Iris is immediately smitten. Onion looks gorgeous in her
bright purple jacket, and she smells terrific. So, Iris invites Onion
to her house for dinner. But when she comes in
and takes off her jacket, something terrible happens. You see, when Onion's jacket is removed, a chemical reaction happens, converting the sulfoxides
that make her smell so great into sulfenic acid, which then becomes a nasty
substance with a long name: syn-Propanethial S-oxide. The gas stings Iris,
and suddenly, she can't help it, she starts weeping uncontrollably. These reflex tears are different
from the basal tears that Iris is used to. Because they're designed to wash away harmful
substances, or particles, they're released in much larger amounts, and their aqueous layer
contains more antibodies to stop any microorganisms
that may be trying to get in, as well. Both Iris and Onion are devastated. They know they can't continue
their relationship if Iris is going to hurt and cry
every time Onion takes off her jacket. So, they decide to break up. As Onion walks out the door,
Iris stops crying. And immediately starts again. Only now, she's not crying
reflex tears but emotional tears. When someone is either
too sad or too happy, it feels like a loss of control, which can be dangerous. So, emotional tears are sent in
to stabilize the mood as quickly as possible, along with other physical reactions, such as an increased heart rate
and slower breathing. But scientists still aren't sure exactly how or why the tears
themselves are helpful. They may be a social mechanism
to elicit sympathy or show submission. But some studies have also found that emotional tears contain
higher levels of stress hormones, such as ACTH and enkephalin, an endorphin and natural pain killer. In this case, emotional tears
are also directly calming Iris down, as well as signaling
her emotional state to others. Sorry things didn't work out
with Onion, Iris, but don't worry. As long as you have
all three kinds of tears working to keep you balanced
and healthy, it will get better. You'll see.

**Transcript**:
(Music) Aw, thank you, thank you. As you can probably tell, I'm an astronaut. No, I'm a DJ/Producer, as it says on the screen. I am also a high school student, just like many of you guys. How many high school students do we have out here? (Cheers) Oh, okay! A good amount. I'm a proud member of my school's marching band, and I run track, as well, so if any of you guys are into that, it's one of my other passions. I have been DJing and producing for a little over three years now, and I've worked with artists that you may know, like Avicii, Skrillex, Major Lazer, Krewella, Porter Robinsion, Carnage, and many others. How many of you guys like dance music? Show off hands, dance music, oh okay. How many of you guys like rap or trap hip hop? Okay, good amount. Jazz? Classical? That's good, you guys have smart minds, that's good. What's great about DJing is that you can combine all these genres into one idea, and what I like to do is combine dance, hip hop, trap, dubstep, even movie samples, and kind of combine them into one set. DJing creates this, sort of, combined culture that really unites many fans. A good example of this is Skrillex and A$AP Rocky's collaboration "Wild for the Night" or, most recently, Avicii and Ella Black's "Wake Me Up." How many of you guys know that song? It's a great track. Now, what exactly does a DJ do? Well, as you just saw earlier, they mix tracks. What I just did was mix a Kanye West intro from "Black Skinheads" with a track called "LRAD." One of the main goals is to really trigger samples, tracks, or clips and kind of create this long journey. I'm going to do another little example for you guys right now of what DJs call a "mashup," which is taking two or more tracks and combining them into one. This mashup was made famous by a Hungarian duo Myon & Shane 54, and it takes the vocals from Krewella's "Alive." How many of you guys know that song? "Alive"? Yeah, okay. I'm going to take the vocals from that track and the song "Language" by Porter Robinson. So, let me just play you the vocals first. (Music) So, that's the vocals, and here's the actual track. (Music) So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to fill these vocals on top of the track and create a new song, a kind of combined song, with the two vocals. (Music) If you turn it down, you can just hear I'm playing it a capella or just the song by itself. (Music) Now, what I'm going to do after this drops is change it into another song. One of the most important things about dance music is really the drop, so I'm going to change it into another song and really catch you by surprise. (Music) And that's one example right there. (Applause) So, as you saw, I took three different songs and kind of combined them into one new idea, which is something plenty of DJs do out there on the professional circuit. There are plenty of ways to get started DJing. One of the main things I did was really take the time to study DJs that inspired me. Whether it was watching podcasts, watching live sets, or just really looking them up online. I really tried to take in what it meant to be a fantastic DJ. One of the best ways to really learn is to ask a friend, you know, a friend who knows how to DJ. Just go over there, ask him a few questions. If no that, thankfully we have a lot of great online resources. One of the things you can do is check out YouTube, check out some demonstrations. Now, many DJs, a high percentage of them, check out Beatport or Soundcloud to find a lot of the tracks. There are also many other blog sites, such as Billboard's CODE, EDMTunes, EDM Sauce, or Dancing Astronaut. Now, there are multiple ways to DJ, and what could originally only be done on turntables and vinyl, by legends such as Larry Levan, Grandmaster Flash, and Paul Oakenfold, can now be done with many more pieces of equipment, such as CDJs, which are, sort of, digital turntables and what I learned on and what I still use to this day. There are many other amazing programs now, such as Ableton, Traktor Pro, Serato, or even apps for tablets and touchscreens. There are many hardware systems just like my APC40 here that can launch samples, clips and tracks. You can also just use turntables, CDJs, an S4 controller, or an Novation Launchpad. And all of these really kind of do the same thing, and that's mix tracks. So, what I'm going to do now is show you guys another mix demonstration. I'm going to start with one of my own songs that I did with my friend Matt Dzyacky, and from there I'm going to go in a sort of medley of different tracks and show you the different styles of mixing that you can do. (Music) So I'll show you guys when I start mixing the new track, so you can hear it coming in. (Music) You can hear in the back, a new song is mixing in. (Music) Now, another thing that DJs use is what's called a mixer, and a mixer has many different effects, such as a beat roll, filter effects, and any other different ones. There's plenty of effects to use. (Music) So, now I'm going into a new song, and after this drops, I'm going to drop it in another song and kind of change it up. (Music) And that's a new song bite. (Music) So I'm just going to straight mash up another song right when this one breaks down. (Music) Now, if I want to change up the music, let's say, throw in some new beats, I can just choose a trap beat I want to throw over the breakdown. (Music) So, I get ready to throw in my new beats now. (Music) And that is the end of that demo. (Applause) Thank you, thank you! Now, the great thing about technologies now is whether it's a two dollar app or a couple hundred dollar equipment, which I'm sure most parents won't want to buy for their child, is that almost anyone who has a passion for DJing and a passion for the music and who might want to pursue a career in it really has the ability to, well, pursue it, such as myself. You can start with an app on a tablet or an app on your phone, even, an app on your iPad, and then move on to bigger equipment. The opportunities are endless, and, as you saw, you can mix many different styles of music. So, thank you!

(Music) So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to fill these vocals on top of the track and create a new song, a kind of combined song, with the two vocals. (Music) If you turn it down, you can just hear I'm playing it a capella or just the song by itself. (Music) Now, what I'm going to do after this drops is change it into another song. One of the most important things about dance music is really the drop, so I'm going to change it into another song and really catch you by surprise. (Music) And that's one example right there. (Applause) So, as you saw, I took three different songs and kind of combined them into one new idea, which is something plenty of DJs do out there on the professional circuit. There are plenty of ways to get started DJing. One of the main things I did was really take the time to study DJs that inspired me. Whether it was watching podcasts, watching live sets, or just really looking them up online. I really tried to take in what it meant to be a fantastic DJ. One of the best ways to really learn is to ask a friend, you know, a friend who knows how to DJ. Just go over there, ask him a few questions. If no that, thankfully we have a lot of great online resources. One of the things you can do is check out YouTube, check out some demonstrations. Now, many DJs, a high percentage of them, check out Beatport or Soundcloud to find a lot of the tracks. There are also many other blog sites, such as Billboard's CODE, EDMTunes, EDM Sauce, or Dancing Astronaut. Now, there are multiple ways to DJ, and what could originally only be done on turntables and vinyl, by legends such as Larry Levan, Grandmaster Flash, and Paul Oakenfold, can now be done with many more pieces of equipment, such as CDJs, which are, sort of, digital turntables and what I learned on and what I still use to this day. There are many other amazing programs now, such as Ableton, Traktor Pro, Serato, or even apps for tablets and touchscreens. There are many hardware systems just like my APC40 here that can launch samples, clips and tracks. You can also just use turntables, CDJs, an S4 controller, or an Novation Launchpad. And all of these really kind of do the same thing, and that's mix tracks. So, what I'm going to do now is show you guys another mix demonstration. I'm going to start with one of my own songs that I did with my friend Matt Dzyacky, and from there I'm going to go in a sort of medley of different tracks and show you the different styles of mixing that you can do. (Music) So I'll show you guys when I start mixing the new track, so you can hear it coming in. (Music) You can hear in the back, a new song is mixing in. (Music) Now, another thing that DJs use is what's called a mixer, and a mixer has many different effects, such as a beat roll, filter effects, and any other different ones. There's plenty of effects to use. (Music) So, now I'm going into a new song, and after this drops, I'm going to drop it in another song and kind of change it up. (Music) And that's a new song bite. (Music) So I'm just going to straight mash up another song right when this one breaks down. (Music) Now, if I want to change up the music, let's say, throw in some new beats, I can just choose a trap beat I want to throw over the breakdown. (Music) So, I get ready to throw in my new beats now. (Music) And that is the end of that demo. (Applause) Thank you, thank you! Now, the great thing about technologies now is whether it's a two dollar app or a couple hundred dollar equipment, which I'm sure most parents won't want to buy for their child, is that almost anyone who has a passion for DJing and a passion for the music and who might want to pursue a career in it really has the ability to, well, pursue it, such as myself. You can start with an app on a tablet or an app on your phone, even, an app on your iPad, and then move on to bigger equipment. The opportunities are endless, and, as you saw, you can mix many different styles of music. So, thank you!

**Transcript**:
If you remember back to the last caesium video,
Pete and Neil tried to launch a bit of caesium metal into water with the small metallic collider
and they had a few problems with surface area and caesium still being stuck in the glass
as well. What I have been asked to do today, is take
this ampoule of caesium into this piece of machinery here which is one of our glove boxes,
try and get it out of the glass so that we can put it in as is. Caesium has quite a surprising use, it is
used to measure time. I donât know if you have ever thought about it but you could define
one second as a fraction of a day, one sixtieth of a minute which is which is a sixtieth of
an hour which is then a twenty fourth of a day. But the trouble with that is that you
will never be able to tell if the earth was going slower or speeding up because the length
of the day would change and you would not notice it so scientists have to have an independent
way of defining the second and this is where caesium comes in. And so now the caesium is going in as well.
Alright, so we will shut the port door So the way in which scientists define the
second is in terms of microwaves and the frequency of the microwaves, we need a standard, something
that can define a radiowave very very precisely, and this is where caesium comes in. So what I need to do now is open up this door
here. The point about caesium is that it is a big
atom it can absorb microwaves, the absorption of the microwave causes an electron to move
from one energy level to another and the advantage of caesium over all other materials is that
this frequency is enormously precise. It is pretty cool it is really good, it is
sort of a really pale gold colour. It is still molten at the moment. It is rather like tuning a radio, I donât
know if youâve ever tuned a radio but as you turn the knob, sometimes, you donât
have to be very precise , you can put it almost anywhere and you get your favourite station,
but there are some stations where you have to adjust it very very accurately and there
is just one tiny place where you can get the right radio station and caesium is like that,
it defines the frequency very very accurately, if you donât hit it right it does not absorb
the radiowaves and so you can use it as a standard, so make sure so make sure that everybody
has exactly the same frequency of their microwave and then once everybody has got the same,
then it is quite easy for everybody to agree that they will count a certain number of waves
as being a second. We are going to store the caesium under oil
so that it does not react with air when it comes out. So this is ready now for Pete to
chuck it in some water and we will stand very far back when he does it. So we have got caesium, we have taken it out
of the ampoule, Neil did that the other day with Debbie in their glove box, they have
put it into a small plastic weighing boat and immersed it in oil so it canât react
with air . Now what we need to do is a very technical operation is to punch a hole into
the plastic boat so that we can lift it out with a piece of string so we can drop it into
some water. Iâve got my friend, Dr Red. It is always good to be very very careful
when you are doing chemistry like this, just in case it goes wrong we have the safety procedures
in place for us, in case we get surprised. So now Neil is going to pass a piece of string
through the hole so that we can put it at the end of a pretty long fishing line so that
we can drop it into water. So this is Neilâs new device, itâs a very
very fancy erection. Essentially we have used a laboratory stand, and we have an eyelet
so this is just to act as a point where we can raise up our caesium on a piece of string.
At the moment, the caesium you can see is a lovely gold colour. Would you believe me,
itâs melting. Look at it. Oh yeah itâs very warm here
today and the caesiumâs melted. So we are just going to try and freeze it again. Well we are going to try and refreeze the
caesium by cooling it with liquid nitrogen. Ok everybody be careful. So we have our caesium under oil. We now need
to lift it up using the new device, and then drop it in the water, and letâs see what
kind of chemical reaction it does today. Everybody ready? Neil? Yep! Wow, quite a spectacular reaction. As the
caesium reacted with the water, gave away its electron, off she goes, itâs caesium
plus. Awesome, it was pretty good. Yeah, itâs pretty great you know when, when
Debbie and Neil took the caesium out of the ampoule they were really really good for us
because they gave us a really large surface area, so it could react quickly as soon as
it went in the water. Generating all that lovely hydrogen ready to explode and make
a bang. Great, good chemistry. Well, the reason that caesium reacts so violently
is that it is a very large atom, so an electron can be removed very easily, in fact if you
dissolve caesium in water, on a very short time scale, a millionth of a second or so,
it dissociates into caesium-plus and an electron, and the energy of the electron interacting
with the water is enough to separate the two and once the electron is in the water, it
then reacts with the water so that H2O dissociates into a hydrogen atom and OH-minus, so in fact
what you are making is a caesium salt which is rather like caustic soda, itâs a strong
alkali and hydrogen, and it is the rapid formation of hydrogen gas that causes part of the shock
of the reaction and then the hydrogen will usually catch fire and react with the oxygen
in the air to give you a small explosion or a big one depending how much caesium youâve
used.

Cadmium? Yes Ok Oh yeah, thatâs some! That is cool man! So cadmium is an element which is really quite
similar to mercury and the way that most people have
seen cadmium is that cadmium sulphide has a very strong orange
colour and it is therefore used for dying things yellow
or orange. If you look round your house or your parentsâ house,
you may easily find a cast iron pot which has, a cooking
pot, which has nice orange sides and orange lid and this is using
cadmium sulphide as a glaze. So this is a sample which was generated or
which was used by some of our researchers in the School of
Chemistry many years ago and this is a sample of cadmium
metal. Now itâs very interesting because it is stored in this
really quite nice box which was perhaps a medication that somebody
had bought, but if we open itâ¦ It's also I believe, to colour the plastic
pipe that you see in the street for gas pipes and so on. I think
it is coloured with a cadmium compound. Now in both these applications,
even though that cadmium is quite poisonous, that
they are so strongly fixed into the materials that it
isnât a threat to people. And we can see the lumps of the metallic cadmium.
Now I am not going to touch the cadmium because we
know of some of the issues with toxicity. But it is used very
often in batteries, or it was traditionally used in batteries.
It is really important that we dispose of our batteries in a correct
way.

**Transcript**:
So our reactionâs ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. So weâre here today and weâve come back
after hours because we need to use this room for a long
period of time because weâre going to do something quite exciting. Because Bradyâs
bought another camera which you can see heâs setup over
there and weâre going to use that second camera to capture
one second of film every minute for maybe two or three hours and weâre going to do
some time lapse. Something Iâve seen on TV with like flowers
opening or plants growing but never with chemistry developing. Silver is one of the few metallic elements
that occurs naturally as the metal in nature. So that if youâre
lucky you can wander around and find lumps of silver lying around on the ground. And
this is how, in ancient times, silver was discovered so it
has been known for thousands if not tens of thousands of
years. Gold is somewhat similar and also copper. But most other metals combine too easily with
oxygen or other elements so you donât find them
naturally. So I thought what weâd do today is through
a competition reaction and that competition reaction is based
on something called the reactivity series of metals. So weâre going to compare the
reactivity of two metals. Itâs a bit like a game of football.
Weâre going to give one of those metals the football and in this
case itâs another component or another salt component, nitrate. So the two metals that
are going to be competing for the nitrate are silver and copper.
And really these are related by something called the
reactivity series. One of these metals is going to win, I know that and I hope weâll
find it during this video. Silver had a particular use in photography
and in the old days when people used photographic film the
black colour that you saw on developed negatives is in fact silver. A photographic film consists
of a layer of silver bromide or sometimes silver iodide
and when the light shines on it the light just starts a tiny
amount of reaction making silver and then when you put it in the developing solution
the catalytic amount of silver that youâve produced causes
a big reaction and you make a large amount of silver. And
so you get this black colour which then you can print as pictures. So on the bench Iâve got a small beaker
or an Erlenmeyer flask, as we chemists call it, which is full of
deionised water. So weâve passed the water through a machine which has taken out all
of the other ions so that they canât play around with the
competition reaction that we want to start today. Firstly, Iâm going
to start off by giving the prize of the competition to silver. So here Iâve got a sample of
silver nitrate. Itâs sensitive to light so I canât leave it out
on the bench very often. So now what I want to do, Iâm going to
put some into the water to make a silver nitrate solution. So I want to make sure that thereâs
plenty in there so that itâs saturated. Now weâve
got to put in the competitor. So what weâre going to do, weâre
going to take some copper, copper metal. And this is just a sample of wire which Iâve
rubbed with some wire wool just to make it sort of nice and
shiny. And now all Iâm going to do is dangle it into the silver
nitrate. Then itâs going to start to compete for the nitrate and weâll see what happens. So Bradyâs started the recording and I think
the best thing for us to do is to go away and do something a
little bit more exciting and come back and have a look in an hour. Silver has become quite popular recently as
a potential new way of making things anti-bacterial: killing
bacteria. So now weâre going to make some flash powder
and the flash powder weâre going to make today is a
two component mixture. Itâs very finely ground magnesium and the second component
is ground silver nitrate, solid OK. So we take these two components
and we mix the two together very intimately and
Neilâs just weighing the materials out right now. So weâre going to put the magnesium
and the silver nitrate, the two powders, together into a
small plastic container here. Weâre going to mix them very,
very carefully and then weâre going to see what happens when we initiate a chemical reaction. For hundreds of years people have used silver
spoons. Partly, I think, because silver is quite easy to
make but also because the silver does have properties that kill bacteria so a silver
spoon is less likely to get harmful bacteria on it than if you have
one thatâs made out of wood or horn of a cow or something
like that. So weâre mixing these very carefully, in
the fume hood, just in case the chemistry starts before we want
it to. And in recent times people have started making
very, very fine particles of silver, so called nanoparticles, which can exist in solutions.
So here Iâve got a solution of silver nanoparticles. You can
see it doesnât look silver it looks a bit yellow actually and you can tell that itâs
got particles in it because, if I can find a torchâ¦ So here weâve got
particles and you can see the particles better if we shine a light
through it and if you look at the light you can see that there is a cone of light that
looks rather like the headlights of a car in fog. And this is an
effect thatâs called the Tyndall Cone which indicates that there
are very, very tiny particles suspended in the solution. So this is not silver dissolved
in the water but actually very tiny particles. So letâs start the reaction, just with a
little bit of water. Wow! I think we should do it again though. Yeah!
LAUGHTER People are now using the silver nanoparticles
for all sorts of purposes. Here you can see that theyâve
been put onto some sort of plastic and you can now buy socks which have silver nanoparticles
on them which are claimed to kill the bacteria that
make your feet smell. So weâre going to repeat the reaction. B-B-B-Bâ¦
SQUAWCKS Thatâs going to come out somewhere isnât
it? Silver will conduct electricity, it will also
conduct heat. If youâve ever tried stirring tea with a silver spoon
it gets very hot, you tend to drop it. It also conducts electricity well. So weâre going to repeat the reaction so
that you can see it again, because that was really fast. This
time weâre going to do it on a glass dish so you can see it a bit better. Weâll pour
out a small amount. LAUGHTER So our reactionâs ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. Did you catch that? I managed to close my eyes this time(!) During the Second World War, when the US government
was involved in enriching uranium as part of
the Manhattan Project they needed an enormous amount of wire to make magnets. And so a huge
amount of silver was taken from the US treasury where it was stored as silver to give value
to the US dollar and was turned into wires to make magnets.
And I believe that the silver was never returned or at
least it wasnât returned at the end of the war as was promised. Well, Iâve managed to fill maybe one minuteâs
worth of time by now maybe two because weâve been
away about two hours. So weâre going to go back and have a look at the flask to see
if there are any changes. If you remember when we left it was
a nice clear solution of silver nitrate with some copper
wire which was just immersed inside. So letâs go and have a look. Thereâs been big changes in our flask! So
if you look carefully you can see now that the copper wire
itself is covered in very, very sharp crystals of silver which have basically become deposited
on the surface. Copper has now won this chemical
reaction. Itâs now going into the solution; itâs taking the salt
element and precipitating solid silver crystals. So if you look carefully, you can see that
the colour of the solution has changed. It was colourless, now
itâs blue which tells me there is another ion, copper, in the
solution.

away about two hours. So weâre going to go back and have a look at the flask to see
if there are any changes. If you remember when we left it was
a nice clear solution of silver nitrate with some copper
wire which was just immersed inside. So letâs go and have a look. Thereâs been big changes in our flask! So
if you look carefully you can see now that the copper wire
itself is covered in very, very sharp crystals of silver which have basically become deposited
on the surface. Copper has now won this chemical
reaction. Itâs now going into the solution; itâs taking the salt
element and precipitating solid silver crystals. So if you look carefully, you can see that
the colour of the solution has changed. It was colourless, now
itâs blue which tells me there is another ion, copper, in the
solution.

**Transcript**:
So our reactionâs ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. So weâre here today and weâve come back
after hours because we need to use this room for a long
period of time because weâre going to do something quite exciting. Because Bradyâs
bought another camera which you can see heâs setup over
there and weâre going to use that second camera to capture
one second of film every minute for maybe two or three hours and weâre going to do
some time lapse. Something Iâve seen on TV with like flowers
opening or plants growing but never with chemistry developing. Silver is one of the few metallic elements
that occurs naturally as the metal in nature. So that if youâre
lucky you can wander around and find lumps of silver lying around on the ground. And
this is how, in ancient times, silver was discovered so it
has been known for thousands if not tens of thousands of
years. Gold is somewhat similar and also copper. But most other metals combine too easily with
oxygen or other elements so you donât find them
naturally. So I thought what weâd do today is through
a competition reaction and that competition reaction is based
on something called the reactivity series of metals. So weâre going to compare the
reactivity of two metals. Itâs a bit like a game of football.
Weâre going to give one of those metals the football and in this
case itâs another component or another salt component, nitrate. So the two metals that
are going to be competing for the nitrate are silver and copper.
And really these are related by something called the
reactivity series. One of these metals is going to win, I know that and I hope weâll
find it during this video. Silver had a particular use in photography
and in the old days when people used photographic film the
black colour that you saw on developed negatives is in fact silver. A photographic film consists
of a layer of silver bromide or sometimes silver iodide
and when the light shines on it the light just starts a tiny
amount of reaction making silver and then when you put it in the developing solution
the catalytic amount of silver that youâve produced causes
a big reaction and you make a large amount of silver. And
so you get this black colour which then you can print as pictures. So on the bench Iâve got a small beaker
or an Erlenmeyer flask, as we chemists call it, which is full of
deionised water. So weâve passed the water through a machine which has taken out all
of the other ions so that they canât play around with the
competition reaction that we want to start today. Firstly, Iâm going
to start off by giving the prize of the competition to silver. So here Iâve got a sample of
silver nitrate. Itâs sensitive to light so I canât leave it out
on the bench very often. So now what I want to do, Iâm going to
put some into the water to make a silver nitrate solution. So I want to make sure that thereâs
plenty in there so that itâs saturated. Now weâve
got to put in the competitor. So what weâre going to do, weâre
going to take some copper, copper metal. And this is just a sample of wire which Iâve
rubbed with some wire wool just to make it sort of nice and
shiny. And now all Iâm going to do is dangle it into the silver
nitrate. Then itâs going to start to compete for the nitrate and weâll see what happens. So Bradyâs started the recording and I think
the best thing for us to do is to go away and do something a
little bit more exciting and come back and have a look in an hour. Silver has become quite popular recently as
a potential new way of making things anti-bacterial: killing
bacteria. So now weâre going to make some flash powder
and the flash powder weâre going to make today is a
two component mixture. Itâs very finely ground magnesium and the second component
is ground silver nitrate, solid OK. So we take these two components
and we mix the two together very intimately and
Neilâs just weighing the materials out right now. So weâre going to put the magnesium
and the silver nitrate, the two powders, together into a
small plastic container here. Weâre going to mix them very,
very carefully and then weâre going to see what happens when we initiate a chemical reaction. For hundreds of years people have used silver
spoons. Partly, I think, because silver is quite easy to
make but also because the silver does have properties that kill bacteria so a silver
spoon is less likely to get harmful bacteria on it than if you have
one thatâs made out of wood or horn of a cow or something
like that. So weâre mixing these very carefully, in
the fume hood, just in case the chemistry starts before we want
it to. And in recent times people have started making
very, very fine particles of silver, so called nanoparticles, which can exist in solutions.
So here Iâve got a solution of silver nanoparticles. You can
see it doesnât look silver it looks a bit yellow actually and you can tell that itâs
got particles in it because, if I can find a torchâ¦ So here weâve got
particles and you can see the particles better if we shine a light
through it and if you look at the light you can see that there is a cone of light that
looks rather like the headlights of a car in fog. And this is an
effect thatâs called the Tyndall Cone which indicates that there
are very, very tiny particles suspended in the solution. So this is not silver dissolved
in the water but actually very tiny particles. So letâs start the reaction, just with a
little bit of water. Wow! I think we should do it again though. Yeah!
LAUGHTER People are now using the silver nanoparticles
for all sorts of purposes. Here you can see that theyâve
been put onto some sort of plastic and you can now buy socks which have silver nanoparticles
on them which are claimed to kill the bacteria that
make your feet smell. So weâre going to repeat the reaction. B-B-B-Bâ¦
SQUAWCKS Thatâs going to come out somewhere isnât
it? Silver will conduct electricity, it will also
conduct heat. If youâve ever tried stirring tea with a silver spoon
it gets very hot, you tend to drop it. It also conducts electricity well. So weâre going to repeat the reaction so
that you can see it again, because that was really fast. This
time weâre going to do it on a glass dish so you can see it a bit better. Weâll pour
out a small amount. LAUGHTER So our reactionâs ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. Did you catch that? I managed to close my eyes this time(!) During the Second World War, when the US government
was involved in enriching uranium as part of
the Manhattan Project they needed an enormous amount of wire to make magnets. And so a huge
amount of silver was taken from the US treasury where it was stored as silver to give value
to the US dollar and was turned into wires to make magnets.
And I believe that the silver was never returned or at
least it wasnât returned at the end of the war as was promised. Well, Iâve managed to fill maybe one minuteâs
worth of time by now maybe two because weâve been
away about two hours. So weâre going to go back and have a look at the flask to see

Weston wasn't entirely mercenary and when he died in the 1820s he Beque that's left in his will samples of his Metals platinum and Palladium to the Royal Society and we still have them let's see what's in the box and here you can see there is sample that is labeled padium and if we look inside imagine that you've discovered a new element what would you do padium was discovered by the chemist Weston and this is what he did as shown by this piece of paper he made Palladium and started selling it you can see here says Palladium the new silver then down here he has the price you can buy five Shillings half a guinea which is 10 and a half Shillings or a guinea which is 21 Shillings and here he gives some of the chemical properties to conf that what it will dissolve in and so on so he starts selling it not himself he gets um a Mr forer to sell it on his behalf and forer claims he's the only person that will sell it these were discovered by won whose job was to to refine metals and he discovered a new metal and if it's your business what you do you sell it makes sense then underneath we got a letter and the letter was written a year later this was 18002 this is 183 and from somebody called chix who's Furious he thinks it's a fraud he doesn't think it's a new metal and here he's describing chemical tests that he's done which shows that Palladium is not a new metal now the problem is that wolston had not published a paper describing it so Williston got his act together and a couple of years later he wrote a paper and here we've got his original paper on the discovery of Palladium so he is now describing properly for the scientific literature what is discovered and I'm always fascinated why people choose the names for particular elements and here in these papers they actually explain why they chose the names in modern papers when they discover elements they publish the paper and then months perhaps years later they actually choose the name but here he says I subsequently that means afterwards obtained another metal to which I gave the name of Palladium from the planet that had been discovered nearly at the same time there isn't a planet as we now know with a name that sounds like Palladium but it turns out that in 18002 they discovered a very big asteroid which in those days they thought was a planet and it was called Palace this was really fashionable and trendies discover an element let's name it after the new planet and it's much the same as people do now when they discover something new they give it a name that goes with the exciting things in the time probably everybody was really excited about a new planet and this was just cashing in on that especially if you're trying to sell things but what this paper does is to show that the element was real and he described some of the reactions and he made this element by dissolving up an ore that's a rock that was containing minerals of various Noble Metals platinum and so on and by careful precipitation he could precipitate one metal after another in here got a box and inside the two lamps of metal we'll come back to these in a minute and here you can see there is sample that is labeled Palladium there are there is a two pieces of Palladium and somebody has written something on this one but what's interesting he left these samples to the Royal Society to be used for science so you can see somebody's chopped off one of these Corners must have done an experiment with it and this piece looks a very strange shape so lots of bits have probably been trimmed off it and then in here there is a inscription saying the Palladium in this packet has been rolled from fused buttons what that means is they made round pieces and then put it through rollers so out came a continuous sheet and you can see here well let's see what's inside I haven't seen it myself there are two more pieces this one is a bit strange somebody's tried to get a splinter off it there is some writing on it this one says number six and somebody else has written something else on it now what's really exciting about the samples is the letter that or the list that I've got here and this list is signed if you look down here by m Faraday one of the really great chemists and physicists who's ever lived it's a list of all the pieces of platinum and Palladium that he could find in the collection of the Royal Society what is written at the beginning is or somebody else has written weight of Palladium 74 o weight of platina that means Platinum 4 5 oz and a bit and Faraday is written out underneath I find only 28 o 420 grains of platina and 73 o and 373 grains of Palladium at this date the 11th of February 1834 so Michael Faraday is sort of saying somebody's pinched some of the Platinum nearly half in the same box as you saw there are two pieces here which are of a very dense me metal they feel very heavy which I think might be the Platinum but they're not labeled they didn't have any paper around them just a piece of plastic so I think we're going to have to get somebody to do a chemical test to tell us if these really are platinum or Palladium and what is really important that these are the samples that Michael Faraday used to do all his electrochemical experiments and so it's really like being back in his lab

**Transcript**:
Weston wasn't entirely mercenary and when he died in the 1820s he Beque that's left in his will samples of his Metals platinum and Palladium to the Royal Society and we still have them let's see what's in the box and here you can see there is sample that is labeled padium and if we look inside imagine that you've discovered a new element what would you do padium was discovered by the chemist Weston and this is what he did as shown by this piece of paper he made Palladium and started selling it you can see here says Palladium the new silver then down here he has the price you can buy five Shillings half a guinea which is 10 and a half Shillings or a guinea which is 21 Shillings and here he gives some of the chemical properties to conf that what it will dissolve in and so on so he starts selling it not himself he gets um a Mr forer to sell it on his behalf and forer claims he's the only person that will sell it these were discovered by won whose job was to to refine metals and he discovered a new metal and if it's your business what you do you sell it makes sense then underneath we got a letter and the letter was written a year later this was 18002 this is 183 and from somebody called chix who's Furious he thinks it's a fraud he doesn't think it's a new metal and here he's describing chemical tests that he's done which shows that Palladium is not a new metal now the problem is that wolston had not published a paper describing it so Williston got his act together and a couple of years later he wrote a paper and here we've got his original paper on the discovery of Palladium so he is now describing properly for the scientific literature what is discovered and I'm always fascinated why people choose the names for particular elements and here in these papers they actually explain why they chose the names in modern papers when they discover elements they publish the paper and then months perhaps years later they actually choose the name but here he says I subsequently that means afterwards obtained another metal to which I gave the name of Palladium from the planet that had been discovered nearly at the same time there isn't a planet as we now know with a name that sounds like Palladium but it turns out that in 18002 they discovered a very big asteroid which in those days they thought was a planet and it was called Palace this was really fashionable and trendies discover an element let's name it after the new planet and it's much the same as people do now when they discover something new they give it a name that goes with the exciting things in the time probably everybody was really excited about a new planet and this was just cashing in on that especially if you're trying to sell things but what this paper does is to show that the element was real and he described some of the reactions and he made this element by dissolving up an ore that's a rock that was containing minerals of various Noble Metals platinum and so on and by careful precipitation he could precipitate one metal after another in here got a box and inside the two lamps of metal we'll come back to these in a minute and here you can see there is sample that is labeled Palladium there are there is a two pieces of Palladium and somebody has written something on this one but what's interesting he left these samples to the Royal Society to be used for science so you can see somebody's chopped off one of these Corners must have done an experiment with it and this piece looks a very strange shape so lots of bits have probably been trimmed off it and then in here there is a inscription saying the Palladium in this packet has been rolled from fused buttons what that means is they made round pieces and then put it through rollers so out came a continuous sheet and you can see here well let's see what's inside I haven't seen it myself there are two more pieces this one is a bit strange somebody's tried to get a splinter off it there is some writing on it this one says number six and somebody else has written something else on it now what's really exciting about the samples is the letter that or the list that I've got here and this list is signed if you look down here by m Faraday one of the really great chemists and physicists who's ever lived it's a list of all the pieces of platinum and Palladium that he could find in the collection of the Royal Society what is written at the beginning is or somebody else has written weight of Palladium 74 o weight of platina that means Platinum 4 5 oz and a bit and Faraday is written out underneath I find only 28 o 420 grains of platina and 73 o and 373 grains of Palladium at this date the 11th of February 1834 so Michael Faraday is sort of saying somebody's pinched some of the Platinum nearly half in the same box as you saw there are two pieces here which are of a very dense me metal they feel very heavy which I think might be the Platinum but they're not labeled they didn't have any paper around them just a piece of plastic so I think we're going to have to get somebody to do a chemical test to tell us if these really are platinum or Palladium and what is really important that these are the samples that Michael Faraday used to do all his electrochemical experiments and so it's really like being back in his lab

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] Mark Zuckerberg a journalist was asking him a question about the newsfeed and the journalist was asking him you know why is this so important and Zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interest right now than people dying in Africa and I want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like so when I was growing up in a in a really rural area in Maine you know the internet me something very different to me it it meant uh a connection to the world it meant something that would connect us all together and I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society but there's this kind of shift in how information is Flowing online and it's invisible and if we don't pay attention to it it could be a real problem so I first noticed this uh in a place I spend a lot of time my Facebook page I'm Progressive politically big surprise but I've always uh you know gone out of my way to meet conservatives I like hearing what they're thinking about I like seeing what they link to I like learning a thing or two and so I was kind of surprised when I noticed one day that the conserv atives had disappeared from my Facebook feed and uh what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on and it was noticing that actually I was clicking more on my liberal friends links than on my conservative friends links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared so Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web Google's doing it too if I search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time we may get very different search results even if you're logged out one engineer told me there are 57 signals that Google looks at everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located that it uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second there is no standard Google anymore and you know the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see you can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's but uh a couple of weeks ago I asked a bunch of friends to Google Egypt and to send me screenshots of what they got so here's my friend uh Scott's screenshot and here's my friend Daniel's screenshot when you put them side by side you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it's really quite remarkable Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results Scott's results were full of them and this was the big story of the day at that time that's how different these results are becoming so it's not just Google and Facebook either you know this is uh something that's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personaliz Yahoo news the biggest news site on the Internet is now personalized different people get different things Huffington Post the Washington Post New York Times all flirting with personalization in various ways and where this this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see but not necessarily what we need to see as Eric Schmid said it'll be very hard for people to watch or cons assum something that has not in some sense been tailored for them so I do think this is a problem and uh I think if you take all of these filters together if you take all of these algorithms you get what I call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is kind of your own personal unique Universe of information that you live in online and what's in your filter bubble it depends on who you are and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don't decide what gets in and more importantly you don't actually see what gets edited out so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix and they were looking at the Netflix cues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out so Iron Man Zips right out right and Waiting for Superman can wait for a really long time what they discovered was that in our Netflix cues there's kind of this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched Rashon but right now we want to watch Ace vura for the fourth time so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert and the challenge with these kind of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they're mainly looking at what you click on first you know you don't it can throw off that balance and instead of a balanced information diet you can end up surrounded by information junk food so what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong in a broadcast Society you know this is how the founding mythology goes right in a broadcast Society there were these Gatekeepers the editors and they controlled the flows of information and Along Came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed us all of us to connect together and it was awesome but that's not actually what's happening right now what we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from Human Gatekeepers to algorithmic ones and the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important this is what Ted does right other points of view and the thing is we've actually kind of been here before as a society in 1915 it's not like newspapers uh were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities then people kind of noticed that they were doing something really important that in fact you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and that journalistic ethics developed it wasn't perfect but it got us through the last century and so now we're kind of back in 1915 on the web and we need the new Gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing you know I know there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google Larry and Sergey who you know people who have helped build the web as it is and I'm grateful for that but we really need to you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility we need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't because I think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being we need it to connect us all together we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives and it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one thank you thank you

uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second there is no standard Google anymore and you know the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see you can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's but uh a couple of weeks ago I asked a bunch of friends to Google Egypt and to send me screenshots of what they got so here's my friend uh Scott's screenshot and here's my friend Daniel's screenshot when you put them side by side you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it's really quite remarkable Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results Scott's results were full of them and this was the big story of the day at that time that's how different these results are becoming so it's not just Google and Facebook either you know this is uh something that's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personaliz Yahoo news the biggest news site on the Internet is now personalized different people get different things Huffington Post the Washington Post New York Times all flirting with personalization in various ways and where this this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see but not necessarily what we need to see as Eric Schmid said it'll be very hard for people to watch or cons assum something that has not in some sense been tailored for them so I do think this is a problem and uh I think if you take all of these filters together if you take all of these algorithms you get what I call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is kind of your own personal unique Universe of information that you live in online and what's in your filter bubble it depends on who you are and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don't decide what gets in and more importantly you don't actually see what gets edited out so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix and they were looking at the Netflix cues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out so Iron Man Zips right out right and Waiting for Superman can wait for a really long time what they discovered was that in our Netflix cues there's kind of this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched Rashon but right now we want to watch Ace vura for the fourth time so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert and the challenge with these kind of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they're mainly looking at what you click on first you know you don't it can throw off that balance and instead of a balanced information diet you can end up surrounded by information junk food so what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong in a broadcast Society you know this is how the founding mythology goes right in a broadcast Society there were these Gatekeepers the editors and they controlled the flows of information and Along Came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed us all of us to connect together and it was awesome but that's not actually what's happening right now what we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from Human Gatekeepers to algorithmic ones and the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important this is what Ted does right other points of view and the thing is we've actually kind of been here before as a society in 1915 it's not like newspapers uh were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities then people kind of noticed that they were doing something really important that in fact you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and that journalistic ethics developed it wasn't perfect but it got us through the last century and so now we're kind of back in 1915 on the web and we need the new Gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing you know I know there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google Larry and Sergey who you know people who have helped build the web as it is and I'm grateful for that but we really need to you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility we need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't because I think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being we need it to connect us all together we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives and it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one thank you thank you

[Music] [Applause] Mark Zuckerberg a journalist was asking him a question about the newsfeed and the journalist was asking him you know why is this so important and Zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interest right now than people dying in Africa and I want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like so when I was growing up in a in a really rural area in Maine you know the internet me something very different to me it it meant uh a connection to the world it meant something that would connect us all together and I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society but there's this kind of shift in how information is Flowing online and it's invisible and if we don't pay attention to it it could be a real problem so I first noticed this uh in a place I spend a lot of time my Facebook page I'm Progressive politically big surprise but I've always uh you know gone out of my way to meet conservatives I like hearing what they're thinking about I like seeing what they link to I like learning a thing or two and so I was kind of surprised when I noticed one day that the conserv atives had disappeared from my Facebook feed and uh what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on and it was noticing that actually I was clicking more on my liberal friends links than on my conservative friends links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared so Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of

**Transcript**:
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies, bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars, but collections of stars, or galaxies. Now, by showing you some of these images, I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects, but more than that, I think galaxy clusters are mysterious, they are surprising, and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So, how big? Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And, in fact, if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now, to give you a number, this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get. But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems, so if we like, we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales, such as, how does gravity work? might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing. And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light? The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it. So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. (Applause)

They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it. So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. (Applause)

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies, bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars, but collections of stars, or galaxies. Now, by showing you some of these images, I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects, but more than that, I think galaxy clusters are mysterious, they are surprising, and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So, how big? Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And, in fact, if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now, to give you a number, this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get. But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems, so if we like, we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales, such as, how does gravity work? might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing. And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light? The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding.

**Transcript**:
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies, bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars, but collections of stars, or galaxies. Now, by showing you some of these images, I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects, but more than that, I think galaxy clusters are mysterious, they are surprising, and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So, how big? Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And, in fact, if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now, to give you a number, this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get. But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems, so if we like, we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales, such as, how does gravity work? might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing. And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light? The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it. So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. (Applause)

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Our story is about a girl named Iris. Iris is very sensitive. (Bird cawing) So much that she is always in tears. She cries when she's sad, when she's happy, (Godzilla roars) and even tears up
when things just get to her. She has special lacrimal glands
to make new tears and special tubes, called lacrimal puncta, to drain old ones away. And she cries so much
that she goes through ten ounces of tears per day, thirty gallons a year! In fact, if you look closely, you'll see that she's crying
a little bit all the time. The basal tears that Iris
constantly produces form a thin coating of three layers that cover her and keep
dirt and debris away. Right next to Iris is the mucus layer, which keeps the whole
thing fastened to her. On top of it is the aqueous layer, which keeps Iris hydrated,
repels invasive bacteria, and protects her skin,
or cornea, from damage. And, finally, there is the lipid layer, an oily outer film that keeps
the surface smooth for Iris to see through, and prevents the other
layers from evaporating. Normally, Iris goes about her day without really noticing
the basal tears doing their thing. That's kind of their whole point. But one day, she meets a girl named Onion. Iris is immediately smitten. Onion looks gorgeous in her
bright purple jacket, and she smells terrific. So, Iris invites Onion
to her house for dinner. But when she comes in
and takes off her jacket, something terrible happens. You see, when Onion's jacket is removed, a chemical reaction happens, converting the sulfoxides
that make her smell so great into sulfenic acid, which then becomes a nasty
substance with a long name: syn-Propanethial S-oxide. The gas stings Iris,
and suddenly, she can't help it, she starts weeping uncontrollably. These reflex tears are different
from the basal tears that Iris is used to. Because they're designed to wash away harmful
substances, or particles, they're released in much larger amounts, and their aqueous layer
contains more antibodies to stop any microorganisms
that may be trying to get in, as well. Both Iris and Onion are devastated. They know they can't continue
their relationship if Iris is going to hurt and cry
every time Onion takes off her jacket. So, they decide to break up. As Onion walks out the door,
Iris stops crying. And immediately starts again. Only now, she's not crying
reflex tears but emotional tears. When someone is either
too sad or too happy, it feels like a loss of control, which can be dangerous. So, emotional tears are sent in
to stabilize the mood as quickly as possible, along with other physical reactions, such as an increased heart rate
and slower breathing. But scientists still aren't sure exactly how or why the tears
themselves are helpful. They may be a social mechanism
to elicit sympathy or show submission. But some studies have also found that emotional tears contain
higher levels of stress hormones, such as ACTH and enkephalin, an endorphin and natural pain killer. In this case, emotional tears
are also directly calming Iris down, as well as signaling
her emotional state to others. Sorry things didn't work out
with Onion, Iris, but don't worry. As long as you have
all three kinds of tears working to keep you balanced
and healthy, it will get better. You'll see.

or cornea, from damage. And, finally, there is the lipid layer, an oily outer film that keeps
the surface smooth for Iris to see through, and prevents the other
layers from evaporating. Normally, Iris goes about her day without really noticing
the basal tears doing their thing. That's kind of their whole point. But one day, she meets a girl named Onion. Iris is immediately smitten. Onion looks gorgeous in her
bright purple jacket, and she smells terrific. So, Iris invites Onion
to her house for dinner. But when she comes in
and takes off her jacket, something terrible happens. You see, when Onion's jacket is removed, a chemical reaction happens, converting the sulfoxides
that make her smell so great into sulfenic acid, which then becomes a nasty
substance with a long name: syn-Propanethial S-oxide. The gas stings Iris,
and suddenly, she can't help it, she starts weeping uncontrollably. These reflex tears are different
from the basal tears that Iris is used to. Because they're designed to wash away harmful
substances, or particles, they're released in much larger amounts, and their aqueous layer
contains more antibodies to stop any microorganisms
that may be trying to get in, as well. Both Iris and Onion are devastated. They know they can't continue
their relationship if Iris is going to hurt and cry
every time Onion takes off her jacket. So, they decide to break up. As Onion walks out the door,
Iris stops crying. And immediately starts again. Only now, she's not crying
reflex tears but emotional tears. When someone is either
too sad or too happy, it feels like a loss of control, which can be dangerous. So, emotional tears are sent in
to stabilize the mood as quickly as possible, along with other physical reactions, such as an increased heart rate
and slower breathing. But scientists still aren't sure exactly how or why the tears
themselves are helpful. They may be a social mechanism
to elicit sympathy or show submission. But some studies have also found that emotional tears contain
higher levels of stress hormones, such as ACTH and enkephalin, an endorphin and natural pain killer. In this case, emotional tears
are also directly calming Iris down, as well as signaling
her emotional state to others. Sorry things didn't work out
with Onion, Iris, but don't worry. As long as you have
all three kinds of tears working to keep you balanced
and healthy, it will get better. You'll see.
