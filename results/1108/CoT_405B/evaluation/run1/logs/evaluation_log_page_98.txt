**Transcript**:
A banker in London sends the latest stock info to his colleagues in Hong Kong in less than a second. With a single click, a customer in New York orders electronics made in Beijing, transported across the ocean within days by cargo plane or container ship. The speed and volume at which goods and information move across the world today is unprecedented in history. But global exchange itself is older than we think, reaching back over 2,000 years along a 5,000 mile stretch known as the Silk Road. The Silk Road wasn't actually a single road, but a network of multiple routes that gradually emerged over centuries, connecting to various settlements and to each other thread by thread. The first agricultural civilizations were isolated places in fertile river valleys, their travel impeded by surrounding geography and fear of the unknown. But as they grew, they found that the arid deserts and steps on their borders were inhabited, not by the demons of folklore, but nomadic tribes on horseback. The Scythians, who ranged from Hungary to Mongolia, had come in contact with the civilizations of Greece, Egypt, India and China. These encounters were often less than peaceful. But even through raids and warfare, as well as trade and protection of traveling merchants in exchange for tariffs, the nomads began to spread goods, ideas and technologies between cultures with no direct contact. One of the most important strands of this growing web was the Persian Royal Road, completed by Darius the First in the 5th century BCE. Stretching nearly 2,000 miles from the Tigris River to the Aegean Sea, its regular relay points allowed goods and messages to travel at nearly 1/10 the time it would take a single traveler. With Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia, and expansion into Central Asia through capturing cities like Samarkand, and establishing new ones like Alexandria Eschate, the network of Greek, Egyptian, Persian and Indian culture and trade extended farther east than ever before, laying the foundations for a bridge between China and the West. This was realized in the 2nd century BCE, when an ambassador named Zhang Qian, sent to negotiate with nomads in the West, returned to the Han Emperor with tales of sophisticated civilizations, prosperous trade and exotic goods beyond the western borders. Ambassadors and merchants were sent towards Persia and India to trade silk and jade for horses and cotton, along with armies to secure their passage. Eastern and western routes gradually linked together into an integrated system spanning Eurasia, enabling cultural and commercial exhange farther than ever before. Chinese goods made their way to Rome, causing an outflow of gold that led to a ban on silk, while Roman glassware was highly prized in China. Military expeditions in Central Asia also saw encounters between Chinese and Roman soldiers. Possibly even transmitting crossbow technology to the Western world. Demand for exotic and foreign goods and the profits they brought, kept the strands of the Silk Road in tact, even as the Roman Empire disintegrated and Chinese dynasties rose and fell. Even Mongolian hoards, known for pillage and plunder, actively protected the trade routes, rather than disrupting them. But along with commodities, these routes also enabled the movement of traditions, innovations, ideologies and languages. Originating in India, Buddhism migrated to China and Japan to become the dominant religion there. Islam spread from the Arabian Penninsula into South Asia, blending with native beliefs and leading to new faiths, like Sikhism. And gunpowder made its way from China to the Middle East forging the futures of the Ottoman, Safavid and Mughul Empires. In a way, the Silk Road's success led to its own demise as new maritime technologies, like the magnetic compass, found their way to Europe, making long land routes obsolete. Meanwhile, the collapse of Mongol rule was followed by China's withdrawal from international trade. But even though the old routes and networks did not last, they had changed the world forever and there was no going back. Europeans seeking new maritime routes to the riches they knew awaited in East Asia led to the Age of Exploration and expansion into Africa and the Americas. Today, global interconnectedness shapes our lives like never before. Canadian shoppers buy t-shirts made in Bangladesh, Japanese audiences watch British television shows, and Tunisians use American software to launch a revolution. The impact of globalization on culture and economy is indisputable. But whatever its benefits and drawbacks, it is far from a new phenomenon. And though the mountains, deserts and oceans that once separated us are now circumvented through super sonic vehicles, cross-continental communication cables, and signals beamed through space rather than caravans traveling for months, none of it would have been possible without the pioneering cultures whose efforts created the Silk Road: history's first world wide web.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 4: Who played a crucial role in establishing a bridge between China and the West in the 2nd century BCE?**

However, the correct answer in this question is Zhang Qian, but the question in the ground truth MCQ is asking about the conquests of a Greek leader. A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the Greek leader.

A more suitable match would be:

**No direct match, but Question 3 mentions the Persian Royal Road completed by Darius the First, and Question 4 mentions Zhang Qian, but not the conquests of a Greek leader. However, Question 3 has an option that mentions Alexander the Great is not present, but Question 4 has an option that mentions Alexander the Great.**

However, if we were to choose the closest match based on the available options:

**Question 4 is the closest match**

But since it does not directly answer the question, it would be more accurate to say that there is no direct match.

However, I must provide an index of the most similar generated MCQ.

And though the mountains, deserts and oceans that once separated us are now circumvented through super sonic vehicles, cross-continental communication cables, and signals beamed through space rather than caravans traveling for months, none of it would have been possible without the pioneering cultures whose efforts created the Silk Road: history's first world wide web.

Reviewer: Caroline Cristal Let's say that it would take you
ten minutes to solve this puzzle. How long would it take if you received constant
electric shocks to your hands? Longer, right? Because the pain would distract
you from the task. Well, maybe not; it depends on how you handle pain. Some people are distracted by pain. It takes them longer to complete a task,
and they do it less well. Other people use tasks to distract
themselves from pain, and those people actually do the task faster and better when they're in pain than when they're not. Some people can just send
their mind wandering to distract themselves from pain. How can different people be subjected to the exact
same painful stimulus and yet experience
the pain so differently? And why does this matter? First of all, what is pain? Pain is an unpleasant sensory
and emotional experience, associated with actual
or potential tissue damage. Pain is something we experience, so it's best measured
by what you say it is. Pain has an intensity; you can describe it on a scale from zero, no pain, to ten,
the most pain imaginable. But pain also has a character, like sharp, dull, burning, or aching. What exactly creates these
perceptions of pain? Well, when you get hurt, special tissue damage-sensing nerve cells, called nociceptors, fire and send signals to the spinal cord
and then up to the brain. Processing work gets done
by cells called neurons and glia. This is your Grey matter. And brain superhighways carry information
as electrical impulses from one area to another. This is your white matter. The superhighway that carries
pain information from the spinal cord to the brain is our sensing pathway that ends in the cortex, a part of the brain
that decides what to do with the pain signal. Another system
of interconnected brain cells called the salience network decides what to pay attention to. Since pain can have serious consequences, the pain signal immediately activates
the salience network. Now, you're paying attention. The brain also responds to the pain and has to cope with these pain signals. So, motor pathways are activated to take your hand off
a hot stove, for example. But modulation networks are also activated that deliver endorphins and enkephalins, chemicals released when you're in pain
or during extreme exercise, creating the runner's high. These chemical systems help
regulate and reduce pain. All these networks
and pathways work together to create your pain experience, to prevent further tissue damage, and help you to cope with pain. This system is similar for everyone, but the sensitivity and efficacy
of these brain circuits determines how much
you feel and cope with pain. This is why some people have
greater pain than others and why some develop chronic pain that does not respond to treatment, while others respond well. Variability in pain sensitivities is not so different
than all kinds of variability in responses to other stimuli. Like how some people love roller coasters, but other people suffer
from terrible motion sickness. Why does it matter
that there is variability in our pain brain circuits? Well, there are many treatments for pain, targeting different systems. For mild pain,
non-prescription medications can act on cells
where the pain signals start. Other stronger pain
medicines and anesthetics work by reducing the activity
in pain-sensing circuits or boosting our coping
system, or endorphins. Some people can cope with pain
using methods that involve distraction, relaxation, meditation, yoga, or strategies that can be taught,
like cognitive behavioral therapy. For some people who suffer
from severe chronic pain, that is pain that doesn't go away months after their injury
should have healed, none of the regular treatments work. Traditionally, medical
science has been about testing treatments on large groups to determine what would help
a majority of patients. But this has usually left out some who didn't benefit from the treatment or experienced side effects. Now, new treatments that directly
stimulate or block certain pain-sensing attention
or modulation networks are being developed, along with ways to tailor them
to individual patients, using tools like magnetic
resonance imaging to map brain pathways. Figuring out how your brain
responds to pain is the key to finding
the best treatment for you. That's true personalized medicine.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

**Generated MCQ Index: 8**

Although Question 8 does not directly ask for the definition of pain, it does relate to the concept of pain and how brain circuits affect the experience of pain. The correct option for Question 8, "They determine how much you feel and cope with pain," is connected to the idea that pain is a subjective experience, which is part of the definition mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly ask for the definition of pain, which is the primary focus of the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar question based on the options provided, I would suggest creating a new question that directly asks for the definition of pain, as none of the existing generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Caroline Cristal Let's say that it would take you
ten minutes to solve this puzzle. How long would it take if you received constant
electric shocks to your hands? Longer, right? Because the pain would distract
you from the task. Well, maybe not; it depends on how you handle pain. Some people are distracted by pain. It takes them longer to complete a task,
and they do it less well. Other people use tasks to distract
themselves from pain, and those people actually do the task faster and better when they're in pain than when they're not. Some people can just send
their mind wandering to distract themselves from pain. How can different people be subjected to the exact
same painful stimulus and yet experience
the pain so differently? And why does this matter? First of all, what is pain? Pain is an unpleasant sensory
and emotional experience, associated with actual
or potential tissue damage. Pain is something we experience, so it's best measured
by what you say it is. Pain has an intensity; you can describe it on a scale from zero, no pain, to ten,
the most pain imaginable. But pain also has a character, like sharp, dull, burning, or aching. What exactly creates these
perceptions of pain? Well, when you get hurt, special tissue damage-sensing nerve cells, called nociceptors, fire and send signals to the spinal cord
and then up to the brain. Processing work gets done
by cells called neurons and glia. This is your Grey matter. And brain superhighways carry information
as electrical impulses from one area to another. This is your white matter. The superhighway that carries
pain information from the spinal cord to the brain is our sensing pathway that ends in the cortex, a part of the brain
that decides what to do with the pain signal. Another system
of interconnected brain cells called the salience network decides what to pay attention to. Since pain can have serious consequences, the pain signal immediately activates
the salience network. Now, you're paying attention. The brain also responds to the pain and has to cope with these pain signals. So, motor pathways are activated to take your hand off
a hot stove, for example. But modulation networks are also activated that deliver endorphins and enkephalins, chemicals released when you're in pain
or during extreme exercise, creating the runner's high. These chemical systems help
regulate and reduce pain. All these networks
and pathways work together to create your pain experience, to prevent further tissue damage, and help you to cope with pain. This system is similar for everyone, but the sensitivity and efficacy
of these brain circuits determines how much
you feel and cope with pain. This is why some people have
greater pain than others and why some develop chronic pain that does not respond to treatment, while others respond well. Variability in pain sensitivities is not so different
than all kinds of variability in responses to other stimuli. Like how some people love roller coasters, but other people suffer
from terrible motion sickness. Why does it matter
that there is variability in our pain brain circuits? Well, there are many treatments for pain, targeting different systems. For mild pain,
non-prescription medications can act on cells
where the pain signals start. Other stronger pain
medicines and anesthetics work by reducing the activity
in pain-sensing circuits or boosting our coping
system, or endorphins. Some people can cope with pain
using methods that involve distraction, relaxation, meditation, yoga, or strategies that can be taught,
like cognitive behavioral therapy. For some people who suffer
from severe chronic pain, that is pain that doesn't go away months after their injury
should have healed, none of the regular treatments work. Traditionally, medical
science has been about testing treatments on large groups to determine what would help
a majority of patients. But this has usually left out some who didn't benefit from the treatment or experienced side effects. Now, new treatments that directly
stimulate or block certain pain-sensing attention
or modulation networks are being developed, along with ways to tailor them
to individual patients, using tools like magnetic
resonance imaging to map brain pathways. Figuring out how your brain
responds to pain is the key to finding
the best treatment for you. That's true personalized medicine.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 10. 

This question aligns with the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, as it discusses the development of new treatments that target specific pain-sensing attention or modulation networks. Although it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it shares a similar intent and idea.

However, another generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9, but it is more focused on the outcome of combining pain processing understanding with personalized medicine.

If I had to choose one, I would say Question 10 is the most similar.

But since the options of Question 10 do not exactly match the options of the ground truth MCQ, I would like to point out that a combination of Question 10 and Question 5's option B could be a more suitable match.

 Nevertheless, based on the question content and intent, I would say the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 10.

**Transcript**:
In the biblical story 
of the Tower of Babel, all of humanity once spoke 
a single language until they suddenly split
into many groups unable to understand each other. We don't really know if 
such an original language ever existed, but we do know that the thousands 
of languages existing today can be traced back 
to a much smaller number. So how did we end up with so many? In the early days of human migration, the world was much less populated. Groups of people that shared
a single language and culture often split into smaller tribes, going separate ways in search 
of fresh game and fertile land. As they migrated and 
settled in new places, they became isolated from one another and developed in different ways. Centuries of living 
in different conditions, eating different food and encountering different neighbors turned similar dialects with
varied pronunciation and vocabulary into radically different languages, continuing to divide as populations 
grew and spread out further. Like genealogists, modern linguists
try to map this process by tracing multiple languages 
back as far as they can to their common ancestor, 
or protolanguage. A group of all languages related 
in this way is called a language family, which can contain 
many branches and sub-families. So how do we determine whether 
languages are related in the first place? Similar sounding words don't tell us much. They could be false cognates 
or just directly borrowed terms rather than derived from a common root. Grammar and syntax are 
a more reliable guide, as well as basic vocabulary, such as pronouns, 
numbers or kinship terms, that's less likely to be borrowed. By systematically comparing these features and looking for regular
patterns of sound changes and correspondences between languages, linguists can determine relationships, trace specific steps in their evolution and even reconstruct earlier languages
with no written records. Linguistics can even reveal 
other important historical clues, such as determining the geographic origins 
and lifestyles of ancient peoples based on which of their words were native, and which were borrowed. There are two main problems linguists face when constructing 
these language family trees. One is that there is 
no clear way of deciding where the branches 
at the bottom should end, that is, which dialects should be considered 
separate languages or vice versa. Chinese is classified as a single language, but its dialects vary to the point
of being mutually unintelligible, while speakers of Spanish and Portuguese can often understand each other. Languages actually spoken by living people do not exist in neatly divided categories, but tend to transition gradually, crossing borders and classifications. Often the difference between
languages and dialects is a matter of changing political 
and national considerations, rather than any linguistic features. This is why the answer to, 
"How many languages are there?" can be anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000, depending on who's counting. The other problem is that 
the farther we move back in time towards the top of the tree, the less evidence we have 
about the languages there. The current division 
of major language families represents the limit at which 
relationships can be established with reasonable certainty, meaning that languages 
of different families are presumed not to be related
on any level. But this may change. While many proposals 
for higher level relationships -- or super families -- are speculative, some have been widely accepted and others are being considered, especially for native languages 
with small speaker populations that have not been extensively studied. We may never be able to determine 
how language came about, or whether all human languages 
did in fact have a common ancestor scattered through the babel of migration. But the next time you hear 
a foreign language, pay attention. It may not be as foreign as you think.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: "How do linguists determine relationships between languages?" 

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. 

But if we look at the content of the transcript, specifically the part that says "Grammar and syntax are a more reliable guide, as well as basic vocabulary, such as pronouns, numbers or kinship terms, that's less likely to be borrowed. By systematically comparing these features and looking for regular patterns of sound changes and correspondences between languages, linguists can determine relationships...", we can infer that the ground truth MCQ is related to how linguists determine if two languages are related.

With that in mind, the generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ is indeed Question 4, but it's not a perfect match.

However, there is another question that might be considered a better match. If we look at the generated MCQs again, we can see that Question 11 asks about the classification of languages into families and branches, and one of the options mentions "linguistic features". This question is related to the concept of language relationships, but it's still not a perfect match.

Considering the options provided, I would say that the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
In the biblical story 
of the Tower of Babel, all of humanity once spoke 
a single language until they suddenly split
into many groups unable to understand each other. We don't really know if 
such an original language ever existed, but we do know that the thousands 
of languages existing today can be traced back 
to a much smaller number. So how did we end up with so many? In the early days of human migration, the world was much less populated. Groups of people that shared
a single language and culture often split into smaller tribes, going separate ways in search 
of fresh game and fertile land. As they migrated and 
settled in new places, they became isolated from one another and developed in different ways. Centuries of living 
in different conditions, eating different food and encountering different neighbors turned similar dialects with
varied pronunciation and vocabulary into radically different languages, continuing to divide as populations 
grew and spread out further. Like genealogists, modern linguists
try to map this process by tracing multiple languages 
back as far as they can to their common ancestor, 
or protolanguage. A group of all languages related 
in this way is called a language family, which can contain 
many branches and sub-families. So how do we determine whether 
languages are related in the first place? Similar sounding words don't tell us much. They could be false cognates 
or just directly borrowed terms rather than derived from a common root. Grammar and syntax are 
a more reliable guide, as well as basic vocabulary, such as pronouns, 
numbers or kinship terms, that's less likely to be borrowed. By systematically comparing these features and looking for regular
patterns of sound changes and correspondences between languages, linguists can determine relationships, trace specific steps in their evolution and even reconstruct earlier languages
with no written records. Linguistics can even reveal 
other important historical clues, such as determining the geographic origins 
and lifestyles of ancient peoples based on which of their words were native, and which were borrowed. There are two main problems linguists face when constructing 
these language family trees. One is that there is 
no clear way of deciding where the branches 
at the bottom should end, that is, which dialects should be considered 
separate languages or vice versa. Chinese is classified as a single language, but its dialects vary to the point
of being mutually unintelligible, while speakers of Spanish and Portuguese can often understand each other. Languages actually spoken by living people do not exist in neatly divided categories, but tend to transition gradually, crossing borders and classifications. Often the difference between
languages and dialects is a matter of changing political 
and national considerations, rather than any linguistic features. This is why the answer to, 
"How many languages are there?" can be anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000, depending on who's counting. The other problem is that 
the farther we move back in time towards the top of the tree, the less evidence we have 
about the languages there. The current division 
of major language families represents the limit at which 
relationships can be established with reasonable certainty, meaning that languages 
of different families are presumed not to be related
on any level. But this may change. While many proposals 
for higher level relationships -- or super families -- are speculative, some have been widely accepted and others are being considered, especially for native languages 
with small speaker populations that have not been extensively studied. We may never be able to determine 
how language came about, or whether all human languages 
did in fact have a common ancestor scattered through the babel of migration. But the next time you hear 
a foreign language, pay attention. It may not be as foreign as you think.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided set. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match.

Question 4 asks "How do linguists determine relationships between languages?" and one of the options (C) mentions "By making systematic comparisons of language features, such as grammar and basic vocabulary." This option is related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about words that are most likely to be borrowed from another language and mentions that grammar and syntax are more reliable guides for determining language relationships.

However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQs do not directly address the question of which words are most likely to be borrowed from another language.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 4 (index 4) is the most similar generated MCQ, although it's not a perfect match.

It would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that directly addresses the question of which words are most likely to be borrowed from another language, such as:

Question: What type of words are most likely to be borrowed from another language?
Options: A. Pronouns, B. Words for family members, C. Words for plants and animals, D. Basic vocabulary

This new MCQ would be a more direct match to the ground truth MCQ.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 7: What is a key factor in the development of different languages?**

Although this question does not directly ask which option is NOT a reason for linguistic divergence, it does address the topic of language development and divergence. However, a closer examination of the options reveals that none directly match the ground truth MCQ's options.

A more suitable match is:

**Question 3: What led to the development of different languages according to the content analysis?**

While this question still does not directly ask which option is NOT a reason for linguistic divergence, its options provide some insight into the factors that contribute to language development and divergence.

However, considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, I would argue that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match it. Nevertheless, if I had to choose one, I would select:

**Question 11: What can influence the classification of languages into families and branches?**

This question touches on the factors that contribute to language classification and divergence, although it does not directly address the ground truth MCQ's question.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks which option is NOT a reason for linguistic divergence and provides options that align with the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would select **11**, with the caveat that it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
I'm a geographer at Middlebury College, and I use digital technologies to reimagine the past. I want to take you to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, July 1, 1863, we're right in the middle of the Civil War. From the northwest, the Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee, and from the southeast, the Union forces under George Meade, converge at this place more or less by chance. They didn't plan to fight here. But the Battle of Gettysburg turns out to be the turning point of the Civil War. Now, Robert E. Lee is probably the most famous American general, widely respected. But at Gettysburg, he made some crucial mistakes, probably the most important was in ordering Pickett's Charge. I'm going to show you how I took a new look at Pickett's Charge with historical maps and GIS. My key map was this extraordinary thing, 12 feet by 13 feet, in the vault of treasures at the National Archives. Here are some of my students at Middlebury to give you a sense of that scale. It was recompiled into a finished map the size of a large poster. You can see the layout of the town of Gettysburg, you see the undulating shape of the terrain. If you look at other details, you can see forests and orchards and streams and roads. I want you to look at those very fine black lines. Those are called contour lines, and they show the elevation at 4-foot intervals, the most detailed elevation I have ever seen. Now, before I explain this image, I need to tell you a little about GIS. It stands for Geographic Information Systems. It's a kind of software that allows you to map almost anything. You can also use it to do terrain analysis. For example, if you're building a ski resort, and you want people to get off the lift and have the most spectacular view possible, you use viewshed analysis that shows you what you can see from a certain point on the terrain. I used that to place myself digitally in the footsteps of Robert E. Lee, to ask, 'What could he see?' and 'What could he not see?' that might have influenced his command decisions. Now, back to these contour lines. This is the best elevation data that I could find. I traced all of the lines, you see in the black and white drawings, some of those lines, stitched them together, gave them elevation values, and then transformed it, within the GIS program, into a continuous terrain. This is a simulation of the ground of the battlefield. Now, I'm ready to place myself in Lee's boots and ask what he could see. The particular moment I want to look at is that battle I mentioned, Pickett's Charge. Lee makes a crucial decision on the morning of the third day, this is July 3rd, 1863, the fighting on the previous two days has been fierce. It's gone back and forth, neither side has a clear advantage. Lee goes down to the bottom of the field, we know this, here's my gorgeous source map again and watch the red circle appear. He goes to the southern end of the battlefield at about 8:00 in the morning with his binoculars and looks through them to figure out where to attack the Union line, where are they most vulnerable. Now, in this next image, I'm going to show you the GIS process called viewshed analysis, along with Lee's line of sight in that sort of reddish cone is the direction we think he was looking. Viewshed analysis, remember, tells me what I can see and what I can't see from a certain point, so in this map, the grey area is what Lee couldn't see. The clear area, where you see that historic map coming through, is what he could've definitely seen. Notice how much of the right side of the map is in grey. Now, we add another crucial piece of information. Someone named John Bachelder, a landscape painter from New Hampshire, went down to the battlefield as soon as he heard about the fight, in order to document where troops had been and to try to paint the battle. He ended up getting $10,000 from Congress in order to document troop positions down to the half hour. He produced 24 maps that we also digitized and brought into the GIS. And this next map shows that troop position information; it's crucial for understanding what Lee could and what he couldn't see. Now, if you look closely at this map, you might be able to see kind of the middle is a black oval around an area that's relatively clear. The blue markings in that black oval are Union troops that I'm definitely sure that Lee could see. But if you look to the right of that, you'll see an awful lot of blue markings. Those are Union troops in the shadows. Now, we know that on the night before Lee's reconnaissance so, the night of July 2nd, he sent out scouts. Of course, he wanted to know where the federal troops were. But quite astonishingly, we have no explanation for this. The scouts came back saying, 'Don't worry, General Lee. We didn't see any troops to the east,' in your map to the right, 'of the Roundtops, some really big hills.' We don't know if they got drunk or fell asleep, but they didn't see almost a third of the Union army. So Lee is blind from his scouts, and from his viewpoint, he's also blind. He decides to attack what he thinks is the weak middle of the Union line, not knowing about where the rest of the troops are. So if you look in the middle of this image, there's a gap in the Union line from where the blue soldiers are at the north of the battlefield and at the south. So let me now play out, using these troop positions, Pickett's Charge. The Confederate soldiers are lined up on the west side of the battlefield, standing under the trees. 18,000 men who first begin to walk and then trot and then run across open farm fields with their rifles leveled at the federal line. Now, the Union army has about 15-20 minutes to organize itself. They see that the Confederates are converging on the middle of their line, and what do they do? The blue arrow here, representing movement of the Union troops, they pull their troops toward that weak center, and let me show you how they were able to concentrate those men in a remarkably short period of time. Lee didn't know that the Union could've done this. You see now, they're standing like a wall, ready to receive the Confederate assault, which happens between 1:30 and about 2:00, 2:30 in the afternoon. There is tremendously fierce fighting, hand-to-hand combat. Now these blue lines, coming in between 2-2:30 in the afternoon, are pulling more reserves, more reinforcements, to that weak center of the Union line. What happens? The Union soliders drive the Confederates off. Lee rides out, among his men, at 3:00 in the afternoon, saying, 'I'm sorry. It's my fault. It's my fault.' This story of sight has been a missing part of the Battle of Gettysburg. Here's their retreat. Historians have not been previously able to figure out what he could and couldn't see. I think it helps explain his decision. Why? Because from his point of view, the federals were very weak. He was attacking at the logical place, but without full knowledge, he set his men out for a dreadful defeat. Now, there's one more piece to this story. Last summer was the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg. And I was able to work with a 3D animator, so we were able to use the GIS information to render the terrain issue as you see it here. And my closing story is about how sight helped the other side. A federal general named GK Warren stood in the spot that this panoramic view is showing you, looking out over the battlefield. And at a key moment on day two, he was able to see on the far horizon Confederate soldiers emerging out of the trees who were about to attack Little Roundtop. He called in reinforcements just in time and saved the day for the Union, setting the stage for the Union almost-victory on day three. So, I hope that all of you who are so gifted with digital technologies will begin to think about how you can use them for history. It can be amazing. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
I'm a geographer at Middlebury College, and I use digital technologies to reimagine the past. I want to take you to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, July 1, 1863, we're right in the middle of the Civil War. From the northwest, the Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee, and from the southeast, the Union forces under George Meade, converge at this place more or less by chance. They didn't plan to fight here. But the Battle of Gettysburg turns out to be the turning point of the Civil War. Now, Robert E. Lee is probably the most famous American general, widely respected. But at Gettysburg, he made some crucial mistakes, probably the most important was in ordering Pickett's Charge. I'm going to show you how I took a new look at Pickett's Charge with historical maps and GIS. My key map was this extraordinary thing, 12 feet by 13 feet, in the vault of treasures at the National Archives. Here are some of my students at Middlebury to give you a sense of that scale. It was recompiled into a finished map the size of a large poster. You can see the layout of the town of Gettysburg, you see the undulating shape of the terrain. If you look at other details, you can see forests and orchards and streams and roads. I want you to look at those very fine black lines. Those are called contour lines, and they show the elevation at 4-foot intervals, the most detailed elevation I have ever seen. Now, before I explain this image, I need to tell you a little about GIS. It stands for Geographic Information Systems. It's a kind of software that allows you to map almost anything. You can also use it to do terrain analysis. For example, if you're building a ski resort, and you want people to get off the lift and have the most spectacular view possible, you use viewshed analysis that shows you what you can see from a certain point on the terrain. I used that to place myself digitally in the footsteps of Robert E. Lee, to ask, 'What could he see?' and 'What could he not see?' that might have influenced his command decisions. Now, back to these contour lines. This is the best elevation data that I could find. I traced all of the lines, you see in the black and white drawings, some of those lines, stitched them together, gave them elevation values, and then transformed it, within the GIS program, into a continuous terrain. This is a simulation of the ground of the battlefield. Now, I'm ready to place myself in Lee's boots and ask what he could see. The particular moment I want to look at is that battle I mentioned, Pickett's Charge. Lee makes a crucial decision on the morning of the third day, this is July 3rd, 1863, the fighting on the previous two days has been fierce. It's gone back and forth, neither side has a clear advantage. Lee goes down to the bottom of the field, we know this, here's my gorgeous source map again and watch the red circle appear. He goes to the southern end of the battlefield at about 8:00 in the morning with his binoculars and looks through them to figure out where to attack the Union line, where are they most vulnerable. Now, in this next image, I'm going to show you the GIS process called viewshed analysis, along with Lee's line of sight in that sort of reddish cone is the direction we think he was looking. Viewshed analysis, remember, tells me what I can see and what I can't see from a certain point, so in this map, the grey area is what Lee couldn't see. The clear area, where you see that historic map coming through, is what he could've definitely seen. Notice how much of the right side of the map is in grey. Now, we add another crucial piece of information. Someone named John Bachelder, a landscape painter from New Hampshire, went down to the battlefield as soon as he heard about the fight, in order to document where troops had been and to try to paint the battle. He ended up getting $10,000 from Congress in order to document troop positions down to the half hour. He produced 24 maps that we also digitized and brought into the GIS. And this next map shows that troop position information; it's crucial for understanding what Lee could and what he couldn't see. Now, if you look closely at this map, you might be able to see kind of the middle is a black oval around an area that's relatively clear. The blue markings in that black oval are Union troops that I'm definitely sure that Lee could see. But if you look to the right of that, you'll see an awful lot of blue markings. Those are Union troops in the shadows. Now, we know that on the night before Lee's reconnaissance so, the night of July 2nd, he sent out scouts. Of course, he wanted to know where the federal troops were. But quite astonishingly, we have no explanation for this. The scouts came back saying, 'Don't worry, General Lee. We didn't see any troops to the east,' in your map to the right, 'of the Roundtops, some really big hills.' We don't know if they got drunk or fell asleep, but they didn't see almost a third of the Union army. So Lee is blind from his scouts, and from his viewpoint, he's also blind. He decides to attack what he thinks is the weak middle of the Union line, not knowing about where the rest of the troops are. So if you look in the middle of this image, there's a gap in the Union line from where the blue soldiers are at the north of the battlefield and at the south. So let me now play out, using these troop positions, Pickett's Charge. The Confederate soldiers are lined up on the west side of the battlefield, standing under the trees. 18,000 men who first begin to walk and then trot and then run across open farm fields with their rifles leveled at the federal line. Now, the Union army has about 15-20 minutes to organize itself. They see that the Confederates are converging on the middle of their line, and what do they do? The blue arrow here, representing movement of the Union troops, they pull their troops toward that weak center, and let me show you how they were able to concentrate those men in a remarkably short period of time.

The Union soliders drive the Confederates off. Lee rides out, among his men, at 3:00 in the afternoon, saying, 'I'm sorry. It's my fault. It's my fault.'

**Transcript**:
There's a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the
congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September 8, 2009. On that day, a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials, a group of Afghan government officials, who would be meeting with some local village elders. The column came under ambush, and was surrounded on three sides, and amongst many other things, Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead. One of the people he rescued was a sergeant, and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter. And what was remarkable about this day is, by sheer coincidence, one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera. It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck. They put him in the helicopter, and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more. I saw this, and I thought to myself, where do people like that come from? What is that? That is some deep, deep emotion, when you would want to do that. There's a love there, and I wanted to know why is it that I don't have people that I work with like that? You know, in the military, they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain. In business, we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain. We have it backwards. Right? So I asked myself, where do
people like this come from? And my initial conclusion was
that they're just better people. That's why they're attracted to the military. These better people are attracted to this concept of service. But that's completely wrong. What I learned was that it's the environment, and if you get the environment right, every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things, and more importantly, others have that capacity too. I've had the great honor of getting to meet some of these, who we would call heroes, who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others, and I asked them, "Why would you do it? Why did you do it?" And they all say the same thing: "Because they would have done it for me." It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation. So trust and cooperation are really important here. The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings, they are not instructions. I can't simply say to you, "Trust me," and you will. I can't simply instruct two people 
to cooperate, and they will. It's not how it works. It's a feeling. So where does that feeling come from? If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era, to the early days of Homo sapiens, what we find is that the world was filled with danger, all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us. Nothing personal. Whether it was the weather, lack of resources, maybe a saber-toothed tiger, all of these things working to reduce our lifespan. And so we evolved into social animals, where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe, where we felt like we belonged. And when we felt safe amongst our own, the natural reaction was trust and cooperation. There are inherent benefits to this. It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within
my tribe will watch for danger. If we don't trust each other, if I don't trust you, that means you won't watch for danger. Bad system of survival. The modern day is exactly the same thing. The world is filled with danger, things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success, reduce our opportunity for success. It could be the ups and downs in the economy, the uncertainty of the stock market. It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight. Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you. It's sometimes trying to put you out of business, but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you. We have no control over these forces. These are a constant, and they're not going away. The only variable are the conditions inside the organization, and that's where leadership matters, because it's the leader that sets the tone. When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first, to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results, so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong, remarkable things happen. I was flying on a trip, and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called, and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law, like a criminal. He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon. So I said something. I said, "Why do you have treat us like cattle? Why can't you treat us like human beings?" And this is exactly what she said to me. She said, "Sir, if I don't follow the rules, I could get in trouble or lose my job." All she was telling me is that she doesn't feel safe. All she was telling me is that she doesn't trust her leaders. The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people. It's because they don't fear their leaders. You see, if the conditions are wrong, we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other, and that inherently weakens the organization. When we feel safe inside the organization, we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities. The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is, is like being a parent. If you think about what being a great parent is, what do you want? What makes a great parent? We want to give our child opportunities, education, discipline them when necessary, all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves. Great leaders want exactly the same thing. They want to provide their people opportunity, education, discipline when necessary, build their self-confidence, give
them the opportunity to try and fail, all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves. Charlie Kim, who's the CEO of
a company called Next Jump in New York City, a tech company, he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family, would you ever consider laying
off one of your children? We would never do it. Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization? Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment. If you get a job at Next Jump, you cannot get fired for performance issues. In fact, if you have issues, they will coach you and they will give you support, just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school. It's the complete opposite. This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred, anger, at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate
salaries and bonus structures. It's not the numbers. It's that they have violated the
very definition of leadership. They have violated this deep-seated social contract. We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could
protect their own interests, or worse, they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests. This is what so offends us, not the numbers. Would anybody be offended if we gave a $150 million bonus to Gandhi? How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa? Do we have an issue with that? None at all. None at all. Great leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers. They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Bob Chapman, who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry-Wehmiller, in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession, and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight. Now in a large manufacturing company, this is a big deal, and they could no longer afford their labor pool. They needed to save 10 million dollars, so, like so many companies today, the board got together and discussed layoffs. And Bob refused. You see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts. Bob believes in heart counts, and it's much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count. And so they came up with a furlough program. Every employee, from secretary to CEO, was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation. They could take it any time they wanted, and they did not have to take it consecutively. But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much. He said, it's better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot, and morale went up. They saved 20 million dollars, and most importantly, as would be expected, when the people feel safe and protected
by the leadership in the organization, the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate. And quite spontaneously, nobody expected, people started trading with each other. Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less. People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three. Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank. I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders. They are authorities, and we do what they say because they have authority over us, but we would not follow them. And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders, and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them, and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them. This is what a leader is. I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater, and as is the Marine custom, the officer ate last, and he let his men eat first, and when they were done, there was no food left for him. And when they went back out in the field, his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat, because that's what happens. We call them leaders because they go first. We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does. We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain, and when we do, the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us. They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader's vision comes to life, and when we ask them, "Why would you do that? Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person?" they all say the same thing: "Because they would have done it for me." And isn't that the organization we would all like to work in? Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
For most of history, humans had no idea what purpose the heart served. In fact, the organ so confused Leonardo da Vinci, that he gave up studying it. Although everyone could feel their own heart beating, it wasn't always clear what each thump was achieving. Now we know that the heart pumps blood. But that fact wasn't always obvious, because if a heart was exposed or taken out, the body would perish quickly. It's also impossible to see through the blood vessels, and even if that were possible, the blood itself is opaque, making it difficult to see the heart valves working. Even in the 21st century, only a few people in surgery teams have actually seen a working heart. Internet searches for heart function, point to crude models, diagrams or animations that don't really show how it works. It's as if there has been a centuries old conspiracy amongst teachers and students to accept that heart function cannot be demonstrated. Meaning that the next best thing is simply to cut it open and label the parts. That way students might not fully grasp the way it works, but can superficially understand it, learning such concepts as the heart is a four-chambered organ, or potentially misleading statements like, mammals have a dual-circulation: one with blood going to the lungs and back, and another to the body and back. In reality, mammals have a figure-eight circulation. Blood goes from one heart pump to the lungs, back to the second heart pump, which sends it to the body, and then back to the first pump. That's an important difference because it marks two completely different morphologies. This confusion makes many students wary of the heart in biology lessons, thinking it signals an intimidating subject full of complicated names and diagrams. Only those who end up studying medicine compeltely understand how it all actually works. That's when its functions become apparent as medics get to observe the motion of the heart's valves. So, let's imagine you're a medic for a day. What you'll need to get started is a whole fresh heart, like one from a sheep or pig. Immerse this heart in water and you'll see that it doesn't pump when squeezed by hand. That's because water doesn't enter the heart cleanly enough for the pumping mechanism to work. We can solve this problem in an extraordinarly simple way. Simply identify the two atria and cut them off, trimming them down to the tops of the ventricles. This makes the heart look less complicated because the atria have several incoming veins attached. So without them there, the only vessels remaining are the two major heart arteries: the aorta and pulmonary artery, which rise like white columns from between the ventricles. It looks -- and really is -- very simple. If you run water into the right ventricle from a tap (the left also works, but less spectacularly), you'll see that the ventricular valve tries to close against the incoming stream. And then ventricle inflates with water. Squeeze the ventricle and a stream of water squirts out of the pulmonary artery. The ventricular valves, called the tricuspid in the right ventricle and the mitral in the left, can be seen through the clear water opening and closing like parachutes as the ventricle is rhythmically squeezed. This flow of water mimics the flow of blood in life. The valves are completely efficient. You'll notice they don't leak at all when the ventricles are squeezed. Over time, they also close against each other with very little wear and tear, which explains how this mechanism continues to work seamlessly for more than 2 billion beats a heart gives in its lifetime. Now, anyone studying the heart can hold one in their hands, make it pump for real and watch the action unfold. So place your hand above your own and feel its rhymic beat. Understanding how this dependable inner pump works gives new resonance to the feeling you get when you run a race, drink too much caffeine or catch the eye of the one you love.

Although everyone could feel their own heart beating, it wasn't always clear what each thump was achieving. Now we know that the heart pumps blood. But that fact wasn't always obvious, because if a heart was exposed or taken out, the body would perish quickly. It's also impossible to see through the blood vessels, and even if that were possible, the blood itself is opaque, making it difficult to see the heart valves working. Even in the 21st century, only a few people in surgery teams have actually seen a working heart. Internet searches for heart function, point to crude models, diagrams or animations that don't really show how it works. It's as if there has been a centuries old conspiracy amongst teachers and students to accept that heart function cannot be demonstrated. Meaning that the next best thing is simply to cut it open and label the parts. That way students might not fully grasp the way it works, but can superficially understand it, learning such concepts as the heart is a four-chambered organ, or potentially misleading statements like, mammals have a dual-circulation: one with blood going to the lungs and back, and another to the body and back. In reality, mammals have a figure-eight circulation. Blood goes from one heart pump to the lungs, back to the second heart pump, which sends it to the body, and then back to the first pump. That's an important difference because it marks two completely different morphologies. This confusion makes many students wary of the heart in biology lessons, thinking it signals an intimidating subject full of complicated names and diagrams. Only those who end up studying medicine compeltely understand how it all actually works. That's when its functions become apparent as medics get to observe the motion of the heart's valves. So, let's imagine you're a medic for a day. What you'll need to get started is a whole fresh heart, like one from a sheep or pig. Immerse this heart in water and you'll see that it doesn't pump when squeezed by hand. That's because water doesn't enter the heart cleanly enough for the pumping mechanism to work. We can solve this problem in an extraordinarly simple way. Simply identify the two atria and cut them off, trimming them down to the tops of the ventricles. This makes the heart look less complicated because the atria have several incoming veins attached. So without them there, the only vessels remaining are the two major heart arteries: the aorta and pulmonary artery, which rise like white columns from between the ventricles. It looks -- and really is -- very simple. If you run water into the right ventricle from a tap (the left also works, but less spectacularly), you'll see that the ventricular valve tries to close against the incoming stream. And then ventricle inflates with water. Squeeze the ventricle and a stream of water squirts out of the pulmonary artery. The ventricular valves, called the tricuspid in the right ventricle and the mitral in the left, can be seen through the clear water opening and closing like parachutes as the ventricle is rhythmically squeezed. This flow of water mimics the flow of blood in life. The valves are completely efficient. You'll notice they don't leak at all when the ventricles are squeezed. Over time, they also close against each other with very little wear and tear, which explains how this mechanism continues to work seamlessly for more than 2 billion beats a heart gives in its lifetime. Now, anyone studying the heart can hold one in their hands, make it pump for real and watch the action unfold. So place your hand above your own and feel its rhymic beat. Understanding how this dependable inner pump works gives new resonance to the feeling you get when you run a race, drink too much caffeine or catch the eye of the one you love.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although the question and options are not identical, the intent and content of Question 7 align with the ground truth MCQ. Both questions focus on the mechanism of the heart's pumping action and the role of the ventricular valves. The correct option in Question 7 (C. The ventricular valves contribute to the efficient pumping mechanism) is related to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (C. The atrio-ventricular valve has parachute-like flaps to stop the water coming out the top), as both describe the function of the heart valves in facilitating efficient pumping.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the closest match, I would choose Question 7.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After carefully evaluating the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content related to the heart's structure.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the two sides of the heart, specifically their symmetry. While there isn't a direct match, Question 8 discusses the figure-eight circulation system, which is related to the heart's structure and function.

However, a more relevant question related to the heart's structure is Question 2, which asks about the names of the ventricular valves in the right and left ventricles. Although it doesn't directly address the symmetry of the heart, it does relate to the heart's structure.

Considering the options provided, I would recommend Question 2 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it is the closest in terms of content and intent related to the heart's structure.

**Transcript**:
This is The Notorious B.I.G., 1995, the Palladium nightclub, New York City. What really I want to talk about is my dedication, my 100% focus, and finding something that I love, my passion point. I fought to be on this stage, to be able to stand next to Lil' Kim and take all these pictures to create one definitive photo. A photo that was the most important of anything that I took. And I really wanted it for future generations to be able to feel the energy that was in that room, and certaintly you can feel that right there. I'm a photographer, this is what I do for a living. I chase these moments, these fractions of seconds, that will never be the same again. You can't take this picture again because I took it, and he's no longer with us, sadly, rest in peace. The definitive portrait of that person, in that moment, is what I strive for every single time out, like when you close your eyes and think of a picture of Jay-Z, I want it to be my picture. So far, so good. Eight album covers for Jay-Z later, I'm not doing too bad. Aaliyah. Gorgeous and amazing, and I really spent proper time with her, conversing, having a conversation, connecting to her, which I find is a big part of my work. That connection, to be able to have a conversation, to say you're doing great, to say why I want a certain picture and a certain attitude. In this moment, we talked about shooting in the Caribbean, and it's sort of a passion point for me, Caribbean culture, Trinidad, Barbados, Jamaica, and I said, "We should do a photo shoot there because I think it would be incredible." And she said, "Yeah, you know, let's do it." You know, as we're taking these beautiful pictures, all this is happening, I'm continuing to converse with her and really connect. So, she believed in my vision at that moment, you know, even while all the work was happening there was a human connection that happened. At the end of the day, I have people sign Polaroids just as kind of a diary for myself. And she wrote, "I can't wait for the Caribbean. I'll see you then." (Exhales) You've got to take a breath. You've got to take a breath. She's missed incredibly. And I think what the reminder is that these moments are really precious, and you really have to take the time to connect to them, to be part of that process, to make a difference in people's lives in that moment. You never know how you're affected by somebody, clearly I am, you can see it, but you never know how you affect that person, how you make that moment a little more important for them. This is my good friend Drake. I had the opportunity to work with him for the FADER magazine. He is a beast and one of my favorites. He's my friend. I shot him for three different days, two in New York, and he had just signed his record deal. He said, "What's most important to me is going home to Toronto to celebrate with my family." So, we went home. We flew home. And he said, "I've got to do a pit stop. I've got to go see my grandmother in the afternoon, and so you probably don't want to bother with that." I said, "It would be an honor to meet your grandmother." I asked for what I wanted. I asked for access that nobody else had because this is what makes a photographer sort of greater, to have a picture that somebody else doesn't have. We want these unique moments. I asked for these moments, right? And I'm reminded of a story. He said, "Grandma, I just got millions of dollars. I just signed a record deal. I've got millions of dollars from Cash Money Universal and Young Money." And she said, "A million dollars?" He said, "No Grandma, millions of dollars. What do you want?" And she said, "I want a kiss, and I want a hug." Again, the reminder of, like, why we do this. It also revealed for me another layer of Drake as a character, and how important this guy is, you know, his message. He's not just about the limelight and self-serving. He's connected to these moments as much as I was connected to this moment as a photographer. I know everybody does this everyday, they ask DMX to get in a pool of blood. This was my challenge this day. I needed to get him to see my vision. I was very clear in what I wanted for "Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood," which was his album cover. You know, I envisioned photographs of him in this pool of blood, just making these things happen, you know? And what was difficult was he didn't see it the same way I saw it, right? He walked in, and he had these pants on. Brand new pants. Everybody feels fresh when they have brand new pants on, right? He said, "I'm not getting in that pool of blood." I said, "Oh yes, you're going to get in that pool of blood." You know? And he said, "No, my dogs, I'm not getting in that pool of blood." And I said, "My dude, you're going to get in that pool of blood." And in a bold statement, using all the psychology knowledge that I had from my schooling at Kenyon College, I dropped my pants in front of 40 people on a set that all were, like, stunned. DMX laughed. He said, "Alright, my dude, put your pants back on, and I'll get in the blood." One of the most epic photos that we've ever created in this hip-hop movement. I'm on home soil. I'm in New Orleans. We've got to give love to Lil Wayne. Lil Wayne is an incredible MC, and the biggest point that I want to drive home here is about the opportunity to create somebody's legacy with them, to take pictures, to see them grow. It was about trust in the moment and understanding that you could make a difference, have a communication, see somebody elevate and move forward, to take a variety of different pictures, you know? Him in a spacesuit. He's a Martian, you know, what can I say, you know? But it was about seeing his growth, and having an important role and communication with this guy in the moment. DJ Quick once said, "Isn't it incredible how you make people see your vision in hip-hop? The way that people look at hip-hop is through your eyes." I'm really, really proud of what I've created, what I've done, and passionately working to make quality work constantly. It's not about taking a photo. For me, it's about giving a photo to people that believe in it so much. Thank you.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about a specific incident during a photoshoot with DMX, where the photographer asked DMX to get into a tub full of blood.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 6, but it's not a perfect match. However, Question 6 does mention the speaker's work with Aaliyah and Drake, and one of the options (A) talks about "using psychology to get subjects to see his vision", which is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, as the photographer used a bold statement and dropped his pants to convince DMX to get into the pool of blood.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the incident with DMX, which is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, but it's still not a perfect match.

Transcriber: Jessica Ruby
Reviewer: Caroline Cristal Russia, with the largest territory in the world, has roughly the same total population as Nigeria, a country 1/16 its size. But this similarity won't last long. One of the populations is rapidly growing, while the other is slowly declining. What can this tell us about the two countries? Population statistics are some of the most important data social scientists and policy experts have to work with. But understanding a country's situation and making accurate predictions requires knowing not just the total size of the population but its internal characteristics, such as age and gender distribution. So, how can we keep track of all that data in a way that makes it easy to comprehend? Complex data is more easily interpreted through visualization, and one of the ways that demographers represent the internal distribution of a population is the population pyramid. Here, the data is divided by gender with females on one side and males on the other. The population numbers are shown for each five-year age interval, starting from 0-4 and continuing up to 100 and up. These intervals are grouped together into pre-reproductive (0-14), reproductive (15-44), and post-reproductive years (45 and up). Such a population pyramid can be a powerful predictor of future population trends. For example, Rwanda's population pyramid shows it to be a fast-growing country, with most of the population being in the youngest age groups at the bottom of the pyramid. The number will grow rapidly in the coming years. As today's children reach their reproductive years and have children of their own, the total population is almost certain to double within the next few decades. For our second example, let's look at Canada, where most of the population is clustered around the middle of the graph. Because there are less people in the pre-reproductive age groups than there are in the reproductive ones, the population will grow more slowly, as the number of people reaching their reproductive years decreases. Finally, let's look at Japan. Because the majority of its population is in its post-reproductive years and the number of people is smaller at each younger interval, this means that at current rates of reproduction the population will begin to decline as fewer and fewer people reach reproductive age. Comparing these three population pyramids side by side shows us three different stages in a demographic transition, as a country moves from a pre-industrial society to one with an industrial or post-industrial economy. Countries that have only recently begun the process of industrialization typically see an increase in life expectancy and a fall in child mortality rates as a result of improvements in medicine, sanitation, and food supply. While birth rates remain constant, leading to a population boom. Developing countries that are farther along in the industrialization process begin to see a fall in birth rates, due to factors such as increased education and opportunities for women outside of child-rearing and a move from rural to urban living that makes having large families less economically advantageous. Finally, countries in advanced stages of industrialization reach a point where both birth and death rates are low, and the population remains stable or even begins to decline. Now, let's take a look at the projected population pyramids for the same three countries in 2050. What do these tell us about the expected changes in each country's population, and what kinds of factors can alter the shape of these future pyramids? A population pyramid can be useful not only as a predictor of a country's future but as a record of its past. Russia's population pyramid still bears the scars of World War II, which explains both the fewer numbers of elderly men compared to elderly women and the relatively sudden population increase as soldiers returned from the war and normal life resumed. China's population pyramid reflects the establishment of the one child policy 35 years before, which prevented a population boom such as that of Rwanda but also led to sex-selective abortions, resulting in more male children than female children. Finally, the pyramid for the United States shows the baby boom that followed World War II. As you can see, population pyramids tell us far more about a country than just a set of numbers, by showing both where it's been and where it's headed within a single image. And in today's increasingly interconnected world, facing issues such as food shortages, ecological threats, and economic disparities, it is increasingly important for both scientists and policy makers to have a rich and complex understanding of populations and the factors affecting them.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the estimated global population increase exactly one week later (May 12th) based on a specific data sheet, whereas the generated MCQs are focused on population pyramids, demographic trends, and historical events.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of population growth and demographic trends, I would select Question 3: "What can be inferred about a country's population trend if most of its population is in the pre-reproductive age groups?" This question is related to population growth and demographic trends, but it is still quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

Transcriber: Jessica Ruby
Reviewer: Caroline Cristal Russia, with the largest territory in the world, has roughly the same total population as Nigeria, a country 1/16 its size. But this similarity won't last long. One of the populations is rapidly growing, while the other is slowly declining. What can this tell us about the two countries? Population statistics are some of the most important data social scientists and policy experts have to work with. But understanding a country's situation and making accurate predictions requires knowing not just the total size of the population but its internal characteristics, such as age and gender distribution. So, how can we keep track of all that data in a way that makes it easy to comprehend? Complex data is more easily interpreted through visualization, and one of the ways that demographers represent the internal distribution of a population is the population pyramid. Here, the data is divided by gender with females on one side and males on the other. The population numbers are shown for each five-year age interval, starting from 0-4 and continuing up to 100 and up. These intervals are grouped together into pre-reproductive (0-14), reproductive (15-44), and post-reproductive years (45 and up). Such a population pyramid can be a powerful predictor of future population trends. For example, Rwanda's population pyramid shows it to be a fast-growing country, with most of the population being in the youngest age groups at the bottom of the pyramid. The number will grow rapidly in the coming years. As today's children reach their reproductive years and have children of their own, the total population is almost certain to double within the next few decades. For our second example, let's look at Canada, where most of the population is clustered around the middle of the graph. Because there are less people in the pre-reproductive age groups than there are in the reproductive ones, the population will grow more slowly, as the number of people reaching their reproductive years decreases. Finally, let's look at Japan. Because the majority of its population is in its post-reproductive years and the number of people is smaller at each younger interval, this means that at current rates of reproduction the population will begin to decline as fewer and fewer people reach reproductive age. Comparing these three population pyramids side by side shows us three different stages in a demographic transition, as a country moves from a pre-industrial society to one with an industrial or post-industrial economy. Countries that have only recently begun the process of industrialization typically see an increase in life expectancy and a fall in child mortality rates as a result of improvements in medicine, sanitation, and food supply. While birth rates remain constant, leading to a population boom. Developing countries that are farther along in the industrialization process begin to see a fall in birth rates, due to factors such as increased education and opportunities for women outside of child-rearing and a move from rural to urban living that makes having large families less economically advantageous. Finally, countries in advanced stages of industrialization reach a point where both birth and death rates are low, and the population remains stable or even begins to decline. Now, let's take a look at the projected population pyramids for the same three countries in 2050. What do these tell us about the expected changes in each country's population, and what kinds of factors can alter the shape of these future pyramids? A population pyramid can be useful not only as a predictor of a country's future but as a record of its past. Russia's population pyramid still bears the scars of World War II, which explains both the fewer numbers of elderly men compared to elderly women and the relatively sudden population increase as soldiers returned from the war and normal life resumed. China's population pyramid reflects the establishment of the one child policy 35 years before, which prevented a population boom such as that of Rwanda but also led to sex-selective abortions, resulting in more male children than female children. Finally, the pyramid for the United States shows the baby boom that followed World War II. As you can see, population pyramids tell us far more about a country than just a set of numbers, by showing both where it's been and where it's headed within a single image. And in today's increasingly interconnected world, facing issues such as food shortages, ecological threats, and economic disparities, it is increasingly important for both scientists and policy makers to have a rich and complex understanding of populations and the factors affecting them.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the wording of the questions is different, the intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the pyramid shape as a country slows in population growth, while Question 8 asks about the population trend if most of its population is in the post-reproductive age groups. However, both questions are related to the population trend and its representation in the population pyramid.

The correct option in the ground truth MCQ is "Become more rectangular," which corresponds to a stable or slowly declining population. Similarly, the correct option in Question 8 is "The population is likely to decline in the coming years due to a decrease in the number of people reaching reproductive age." 

While there isn't a direct match between the options, Question 8 is the most similar in terms of question intent and content.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that is most similar in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what a Population Pyramid does not give you information about, with options including birth rates, actual number of people, life expectancy, and death rates.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is the most similar, as it asks about the primary advantage of using population pyramids in demography. However, it does not directly ask about what a Population Pyramid does not give you information about.

A more relevant question would be one that asks about the limitations or exclusions of population pyramids. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, but it's still not a direct match.

Transcriber: Jessica Ruby
Reviewer: Caroline Cristal Russia, with the largest territory in the world, has roughly the same total population as Nigeria, a country 1/16 its size. But this similarity won't last long. One of the populations is rapidly growing, while the other is slowly declining. What can this tell us about the two countries? Population statistics are some of the most important data social scientists and policy experts have to work with. But understanding a country's situation and making accurate predictions requires knowing not just the total size of the population but its internal characteristics, such as age and gender distribution. So, how can we keep track of all that data in a way that makes it easy to comprehend? Complex data is more easily interpreted through visualization, and one of the ways that demographers represent the internal distribution of a population is the population pyramid. Here, the data is divided by gender with females on one side and males on the other. The population numbers are shown for each five-year age interval, starting from 0-4 and continuing up to 100 and up. These intervals are grouped together into pre-reproductive (0-14), reproductive (15-44), and post-reproductive years (45 and up). Such a population pyramid can be a powerful predictor of future population trends. For example, Rwanda's population pyramid shows it to be a fast-growing country, with most of the population being in the youngest age groups at the bottom of the pyramid. The number will grow rapidly in the coming years. As today's children reach their reproductive years and have children of their own, the total population is almost certain to double within the next few decades. For our second example, let's look at Canada, where most of the population is clustered around the middle of the graph. Because there are less people in the pre-reproductive age groups than there are in the reproductive ones, the population will grow more slowly, as the number of people reaching their reproductive years decreases. Finally, let's look at Japan. Because the majority of its population is in its post-reproductive years and the number of people is smaller at each younger interval, this means that at current rates of reproduction the population will begin to decline as fewer and fewer people reach reproductive age. Comparing these three population pyramids side by side shows us three different stages in a demographic transition, as a country moves from a pre-industrial society to one with an industrial or post-industrial economy. Countries that have only recently begun the process of industrialization typically see an increase in life expectancy and a fall in child mortality rates as a result of improvements in medicine, sanitation, and food supply. While birth rates remain constant, leading to a population boom. Developing countries that are farther along in the industrialization process begin to see a fall in birth rates, due to factors such as increased education and opportunities for women outside of child-rearing and a move from rural to urban living that makes having large families less economically advantageous. Finally, countries in advanced stages of industrialization reach a point where both birth and death rates are low, and the population remains stable or even begins to decline. Now, let's take a look at the projected population pyramids for the same three countries in 2050. What do these tell us about the expected changes in each country's population, and what kinds of factors can alter the shape of these future pyramids? A population pyramid can be useful not only as a predictor of a country's future but as a record of its past. Russia's population pyramid still bears the scars of World War II, which explains both the fewer numbers of elderly men compared to elderly women and the relatively sudden population increase as soldiers returned from the war and normal life resumed. China's population pyramid reflects the establishment of the one child policy 35 years before, which prevented a population boom such as that of Rwanda but also led to sex-selective abortions, resulting in more male children than female children. Finally, the pyramid for the United States shows the baby boom that followed World War II. As you can see, population pyramids tell us far more about a country than just a set of numbers, by showing both where it's been and where it's headed within a single image. And in today's increasingly interconnected world, facing issues such as food shortages, ecological threats, and economic disparities, it is increasingly important for both scientists and policy makers to have a rich and complex understanding of populations and the factors affecting them.

**Transcript**:
To understand climate change, think of the game "Tetris." For eons, Earth has played a version of this game with blocks of carbon. They enter the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas from volcanoes, decaying plant matter, breathing creatures and the surface of the sea. And they leave the atmosphere when they're used by plants during photosynthesis, absorbed back into the ocean, or stored in soil and sediment. This game of Tetris is called the carbon cycle, and it's the engine of life on Earth. What's the connection to climate? Well, when that carbon dioxide is in the air, waiting to be reabsorbed, it traps a portion of the sun's heat, which would otherwise escape to space. That's why carbon dioxide is called a greenhouse gas. It creates a blanket of warmth, known as the greenhouse effect, that keeps our Earth from freezing like Mars. The more carbon dioxide blocks hang out in the atmosphere waiting to be cleared, the warmer Earth becomes. Though the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has varied through ice ages and astroid impacts, over the past 8,000 years the stable climate we know took shape, allowing human civilization to thrive. But about 200 years ago, we began digging up that old carbon that had been stored in the soil. These fossil fuels, coal, oil and natural gas are made from the buried remains of plants and animals that died long before humans evolved. The energy stored inside them was able to power our factories, cars and power plants. But burning these fuels also injected new carbon blocks into Earth's Tetris game. At the same time, we cleared forests for agriculture, reducing the Earth's ability to remove the blocks. And since 1750, the amount of carbon in the atmosophere has increased by 40%, and shows no sign of slowing. Just like in Tetris, the more blocks pile up, the harder it becomes to restore stability. The extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere accelerates the greenhouse effect by trapping more heat near the surface and causing polar ice caps to melt. And the more they melt, the less sunlight they're able to reflect, making the oceans warm even faster. Sea levels rise, coastal populations are threatened with flooding, natural ecosystems are disrupted, and the weather becomes more extreme over time. Climate change may effect different people and places in different ways. But, ultimately, it's a game that we're all stuck playing. And unlike in Tetris, we won't get a chance to start over and try again.

To understand climate change, think of the game "Tetris." For eons, Earth has played a version of this game with blocks of carbon. They enter the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas from volcanoes, decaying plant matter, breathing creatures and the surface of the sea. And they leave the atmosphere when they're used by plants during photosynthesis, absorbed back into the ocean, or stored in soil and sediment. This game of Tetris is called the carbon cycle, and it's the engine of life on Earth. What's the connection to climate? Well, when that carbon dioxide is in the air, waiting to be reabsorbed, it traps a portion of the sun's heat, which would otherwise escape to space. That's why carbon dioxide is called a greenhouse gas. It creates a blanket of warmth, known as the greenhouse effect, that keeps our Earth from freezing like Mars. The more carbon dioxide blocks hang out in the atmosphere waiting to be cleared, the warmer Earth becomes. Though the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has varied through ice ages and astroid impacts, over the past 8,000 years the stable climate we know took shape, allowing human civilization to thrive. But about 200 years ago, we began digging up that old carbon that had been stored in the soil. These fossil fuels, coal, oil and natural gas are made from the buried remains of plants and animals that died long before humans evolved. The energy stored inside them was able to power our factories, cars and power plants. But burning these fuels also injected new carbon blocks into Earth's Tetris game. At the same time, we cleared forests for agriculture, reducing the Earth's ability to remove the blocks. And since 1750, the amount of carbon in the atmosophere has increased by 40%, and shows no sign of slowing. Just like in Tetris, the more blocks pile up, the harder it becomes to restore stability. The extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere accelerates the greenhouse effect by trapping more heat near the surface and causing polar ice caps to melt. And the more they melt, the less sunlight they're able to reflect, making the oceans warm even faster. Sea levels rise, coastal populations are threatened with flooding, natural ecosystems are disrupted, and the weather becomes more extreme over time. Climate change may effect different people and places in different ways. But, ultimately, it's a game that we're all stuck playing. And unlike in Tetris, we won't get a chance to start over and try again.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You're in line at the grocery store when, uh oh, someone sneezes on you. The cold virus is sucked inside your lungs and lands on a cell on your airway lining. Every living thing on Earth is made of cells, from the smallest one-celled bacteria to the giant blue whale to you. Each cell in your body is surrounded by a cell membrane, a thick flexible layer made of fats and proteins, that surrounds and protects the inner components. It's semipermeable, meaning that it lets some thing pass in and out but blocks others. The cell membrane is covered with tiny projections. They all have functions, like helping cells adhere to their neighbors or binding to nutrients the cell will need. Animal and plant cells have cell membranes. Only plant cells have a cell wall, which is made of rigid cellulose that gives the plant structure. The virus cell that was sneezed into your lungs is sneaky. Pretending to be a friend, it attaches to a projection on the cell membrane, and the cell brings it through the cell membrane and inside. When the virus gets through, the cell recognizes its mistake. An enemy is inside! Special enzymes arrive at the scene and chop the virus to pieces. They then send one of the pieces back through the cell membrane, where the cell displays it to warn neighboring cells about the invader. A nearby cell sees the warning and immediately goes into action. It needs to make antibodies, proteins that will attack and kill the invading virus. This process starts in the nucleus. The nucleus contains our DNA, the blueprint that tells our cells how to make everything our bodies need to function. A certain section of our DNA contains instructions that tell our cells how to make antibodies. Enzymes in the nucleus find the right section of DNA, then create a copy of these instructions, called messenger RNA. The messenger RNA leaves the nucleus to carry out its orders. The messenger RNA travels to a ribosome. There can be as many as 10 million ribosomes in a human cell, all studded along a ribbon-like structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. This ribosome reads the instructions from the nucleus. It takes amino acids and links them together one by one creating an antibody protein that will go fight the virus. But before it can do that, the antibody needs to leave the cell. The antibody heads to the golgi apparatus. Here, it's packed up for delivery outside the cell. Enclosed in a bubble made of the same material as the cell membrane, the golgi apparatus also gives the antibody directions, telling it how to get to the edge of the cell. When it gets there, the bubble surrounding the antibody fuses to the cell membrane. The cell ejects the antibody, and it heads out to track down the virus. The leftover bubble will be broken down by the cell's lysosomes and its pieces recycled over and over again. Where did the cell get the energy to do all this? That's the roll of the mitochondria. To make energy, the mitochondria takes oxygen, this is the only reason we breathe it, and adds electrons from the food we eat to make water molecules. That process also creates a high energy molecule, called ATP which the cell uses to power all of its parts. Plant cells make energy a different way. They have chloroplasts that combine carbon dioxide and water with light energy from the sun to create oxygen and sugar, a form of chemical energy. All the parts of a cell have to work together to keep things running smoothly, and all the cells of your body have to work together to keep you running smoothly. That's a whole lot of cells. Scientists think there are about 37 trillion of them.

**Transcript**:
You're in line at the grocery store when, uh oh, someone sneezes on you. The cold virus is sucked inside your lungs and lands on a cell on your airway lining. Every living thing on Earth is made of cells, from the smallest one-celled bacteria to the giant blue whale to you. Each cell in your body is surrounded by a cell membrane, a thick flexible layer made of fats and proteins, that surrounds and protects the inner components. It's semipermeable, meaning that it lets some thing pass in and out but blocks others. The cell membrane is covered with tiny projections. They all have functions, like helping cells adhere to their neighbors or binding to nutrients the cell will need. Animal and plant cells have cell membranes. Only plant cells have a cell wall, which is made of rigid cellulose that gives the plant structure. The virus cell that was sneezed into your lungs is sneaky. Pretending to be a friend, it attaches to a projection on the cell membrane, and the cell brings it through the cell membrane and inside. When the virus gets through, the cell recognizes its mistake. An enemy is inside! Special enzymes arrive at the scene and chop the virus to pieces. They then send one of the pieces back through the cell membrane, where the cell displays it to warn neighboring cells about the invader. A nearby cell sees the warning and immediately goes into action. It needs to make antibodies, proteins that will attack and kill the invading virus. This process starts in the nucleus. The nucleus contains our DNA, the blueprint that tells our cells how to make everything our bodies need to function. A certain section of our DNA contains instructions that tell our cells how to make antibodies. Enzymes in the nucleus find the right section of DNA, then create a copy of these instructions, called messenger RNA. The messenger RNA leaves the nucleus to carry out its orders. The messenger RNA travels to a ribosome. There can be as many as 10 million ribosomes in a human cell, all studded along a ribbon-like structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. This ribosome reads the instructions from the nucleus. It takes amino acids and links them together one by one creating an antibody protein that will go fight the virus. But before it can do that, the antibody needs to leave the cell. The antibody heads to the golgi apparatus. Here, it's packed up for delivery outside the cell. Enclosed in a bubble made of the same material as the cell membrane, the golgi apparatus also gives the antibody directions, telling it how to get to the edge of the cell. When it gets there, the bubble surrounding the antibody fuses to the cell membrane. The cell ejects the antibody, and it heads out to track down the virus. The leftover bubble will be broken down by the cell's lysosomes and its pieces recycled over and over again. Where did the cell get the energy to do all this? That's the roll of the mitochondria. To make energy, the mitochondria takes oxygen, this is the only reason we breathe it, and adds electrons from the food we eat to make water molecules. That process also creates a high energy molecule, called ATP which the cell uses to power all of its parts. Plant cells make energy a different way. They have chloroplasts that combine carbon dioxide and water with light energy from the sun to create oxygen and sugar, a form of chemical energy. All the parts of a cell have to work together to keep things running smoothly, and all the cells of your body have to work together to keep you running smoothly. That's a whole lot of cells. Scientists think there are about 37 trillion of them.

**Transcript**:
He was one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, forever changing the course of one of the world's largest countries. But was he a hero who toppled an oppressive tyranny or a villain who replaced it with another? It's time to put Lenin on the stand in History vs. Lenin. "Order, order, hmm. Now, wasn't it your fault that the band broke up?" "Your honor, this is Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, AKA Lenin, the rabblerouser who helped overthrow 
the Russian tsar Nicholas II in 1917 and founded the Soviet Union, one of the worst dictatorships of the 20th century." "Ohh." "The tsar was a bloody tyrant under whom the masses toiled in slavery." "This is rubbish. Serfdom had already been abolished in 1861." "And replaced by something worse. The factory bosses treated the people far worse than their former feudal landlords. And unlike the landlords, they were always there. Russian workers toiled for eleven hours a day and were the lowest paid in all of Europe." "But Tsar Nicholas made laws to protect the workers." "He reluctantly did the bare minimum to avert revolution, and even there, he failed. Remember what happened in 1905 after his troops fired on peaceful petitioners?" "Yes, and the tsar ended the rebellion by introducing a constitution and an elected parliament, the Duma." "While retaining absolute power and dissolving them whenever he wanted." "Perhaps there would've been more reforms in due time if radicals, like Lenin, weren't always stirring up trouble." "Your Honor, Lenin had seen his older brother Aleksandr executed by the previous tsar for revolutionary activity, and even after the reforms, Nicholas continued the same mass repression and executions, as well as the unpopular involvement in World War I, that cost Russia so many lives and resources." "Hm, this tsar doesn't sound like such a capital fellow." "Your Honor, maybe Nicholas II did doom himself with bad decisions, but Lenin deserves no credit for this. When the February 1917 uprisings finally forced the tsar to abdicate, Lenin was still exiled in Switzerland." "Hm, so who came to power?" "The Duma formed a provisional government, led by Alexander Kerensky, an incompetent bourgeois failure. He even launched another failed offensive in the war, where Russia had already lost so much, instead of ending it like the people wanted." "It was a constitutional social democratic government, the most progressive of its time. And it could have succeeded eventually if Lenin hadn't returned in April, sent by the Germans to undermine the Russian war effort and instigate riots." "Such slander! The July Days were a spontaneous and justified reaction against the government's failures. And Kerensky showed his true colors when he blamed Lenin and arrested and outlawed his Bolshevik party, forcing him to flee into exile again. Some democracy! It's a good thing the government collapsed under their own incompetence and greed when they tried to stage a military coup then had to ask the Bolsheviks for help when it backfired. After that, all Lenin had to do was return in October and take charge. The government was peacefully overthrown overnight." "But what the Bolsheviks did after gaining power wasn't very peaceful. How many people did they execute without trial? And was it really necessary to murder the tsar's entire family, even the children?" "Russia was being attacked by foreign imperialists, trying to restore the tsar. Any royal heir that was rescued would be recognized as ruler by foreign governments. It would've been the end of everything the people had fought so hard to achieve. Besides, Lenin may not have given the order." "But it was not only imperialists that the Bolsheviks killed. What about the purges and executions of other socialist and anarchist parties, their old allies? What about the Tambov Rebellion, where peasants, resisting grain confiscation, were killed with poison gas? Or sending the army to crush the workers in Kronstadt, who were demanding democratic self-management? Was this still fighting for the people?" "Yes! The measures were difficult, but it was a difficult time. The new government needed to secure itself while being attacked from all sides, so that the socialist order could be established." "And what good came of this socialist order?

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the topic and historical context, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the abolition of serfdom in Russia, which is mentioned in the transcript as having occurred in 1861. While none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic, Question 3 does mention the perception of Tsar Nicholas II by the masses, which is related to the historical context of serfdom and its abolition.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest in terms of historical context, I would suggest:

 Question 3: How was Russian Tsar Nicholas II perceived by the masses? 

This question is not directly related to the abolition of serfdom, but it does provide some context about the tsar's rule and the social conditions of the time.

It's worth noting that the generated MCQs seem to focus more on Lenin's life, ideology, and actions, rather than the specific historical event of serfdom abolition. Therefore, a direct match is not possible based on the provided generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
He was one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, forever changing the course of one of the world's largest countries. But was he a hero who toppled an oppressive tyranny or a villain who replaced it with another? It's time to put Lenin on the stand in History vs. Lenin. "Order, order, hmm. Now, wasn't it your fault that the band broke up?" "Your honor, this is Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, AKA Lenin, the rabblerouser who helped overthrow 
the Russian tsar Nicholas II in 1917 and founded the Soviet Union, one of the worst dictatorships of the 20th century." "Ohh." "The tsar was a bloody tyrant under whom the masses toiled in slavery." "This is rubbish. Serfdom had already been abolished in 1861." "And replaced by something worse. The factory bosses treated the people far worse than their former feudal landlords. And unlike the landlords, they were always there. Russian workers toiled for eleven hours a day and were the lowest paid in all of Europe." "But Tsar Nicholas made laws to protect the workers." "He reluctantly did the bare minimum to avert revolution, and even there, he failed. Remember what happened in 1905 after his troops fired on peaceful petitioners?" "Yes, and the tsar ended the rebellion by introducing a constitution and an elected parliament, the Duma." "While retaining absolute power and dissolving them whenever he wanted." "Perhaps there would've been more reforms in due time if radicals, like Lenin, weren't always stirring up trouble." "Your Honor, Lenin had seen his older brother Aleksandr executed by the previous tsar for revolutionary activity, and even after the reforms, Nicholas continued the same mass repression and executions, as well as the unpopular involvement in World War I, that cost Russia so many lives and resources." "Hm, this tsar doesn't sound like such a capital fellow." "Your Honor, maybe Nicholas II did doom himself with bad decisions, but Lenin deserves no credit for this. When the February 1917 uprisings finally forced the tsar to abdicate, Lenin was still exiled in Switzerland." "Hm, so who came to power?" "The Duma formed a provisional government, led by Alexander Kerensky, an incompetent bourgeois failure. He even launched another failed offensive in the war, where Russia had already lost so much, instead of ending it like the people wanted." "It was a constitutional social democratic government, the most progressive of its time. And it could have succeeded eventually if Lenin hadn't returned in April, sent by the Germans to undermine the Russian war effort and instigate riots." "Such slander! The July Days were a spontaneous and justified reaction against the government's failures. And Kerensky showed his true colors when he blamed Lenin and arrested and outlawed his Bolshevik party, forcing him to flee into exile again. Some democracy! It's a good thing the government collapsed under their own incompetence and greed when they tried to stage a military coup then had to ask the Bolsheviks for help when it backfired. After that, all Lenin had to do was return in October and take charge. The government was peacefully overthrown overnight." "But what the Bolsheviks did after gaining power wasn't very peaceful. How many people did they execute without trial? And was it really necessary to murder the tsar's entire family, even the children?" "Russia was being attacked by foreign imperialists, trying to restore the tsar. Any royal heir that was rescued would be recognized as ruler by foreign governments. It would've been the end of everything the people had fought so hard to achieve. Besides, Lenin may not have given the order." "But it was not only imperialists that the Bolsheviks killed. What about the purges and executions of other socialist and anarchist parties, their old allies? What about the Tambov Rebellion, where peasants, resisting grain confiscation, were killed with poison gas? Or sending the army to crush the workers in Kronstadt, who were demanding democratic self-management? Was this still fighting for the people?" "Yes! The measures were difficult, but it was a difficult time. The new government needed to secure itself while being attacked from all sides, so that the socialist order could be established." "And what good came of this socialist order? Even after the civil war was won, there were famines, repression and millions executed or sent to die in camps, while Lenin's successor Stalin established a cult of personality and absolute power." "That wasn't the plan. Lenin never cared for personal gains, even his enemies admitted that he fully believed in his cause, living modestly and working tirelessly from his student days until his too early death.

"But these advances could still have happened, even without Lenin and the repressive regime he established." "Yes, and I could've been a famous rock and roll singer. But how would I have sounded?" We can never be sure how things could've unfolded if different people were in power or different decisions were made, but to avoid the mistakes of the past, we must always be willing to put historical figures on trial.

**Transcript**:
He was one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, forever changing the course of one of the world's largest countries. But was he a hero who toppled an oppressive tyranny or a villain who replaced it with another? It's time to put Lenin on the stand in History vs. Lenin. "Order, order, hmm. Now, wasn't it your fault that the band broke up?" "Your honor, this is Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, AKA Lenin, the rabblerouser who helped overthrow 
the Russian tsar Nicholas II in 1917 and founded the Soviet Union, one of the worst dictatorships of the 20th century." "Ohh." "The tsar was a bloody tyrant under whom the masses toiled in slavery." "This is rubbish. Serfdom had already been abolished in 1861." "And replaced by something worse. The factory bosses treated the people far worse than their former feudal landlords. And unlike the landlords, they were always there. Russian workers toiled for eleven hours a day and were the lowest paid in all of Europe." "But Tsar Nicholas made laws to protect the workers." "He reluctantly did the bare minimum to avert revolution, and even there, he failed. Remember what happened in 1905 after his troops fired on peaceful petitioners?" "Yes, and the tsar ended the rebellion by introducing a constitution and an elected parliament, the Duma." "While retaining absolute power and dissolving them whenever he wanted." "Perhaps there would've been more reforms in due time if radicals, like Lenin, weren't always stirring up trouble." "Your Honor, Lenin had seen his older brother Aleksandr executed by the previous tsar for revolutionary activity, and even after the reforms, Nicholas continued the same mass repression and executions, as well as the unpopular involvement in World War I, that cost Russia so many lives and resources." "Hm, this tsar doesn't sound like such a capital fellow." "Your Honor, maybe Nicholas II did doom himself with bad decisions, but Lenin deserves no credit for this. When the February 1917 uprisings finally forced the tsar to abdicate, Lenin was still exiled in Switzerland." "Hm, so who came to power?" "The Duma formed a provisional government, led by Alexander Kerensky, an incompetent bourgeois failure. He even launched another failed offensive in the war, where Russia had already lost so much, instead of ending it like the people wanted." "It was a constitutional social democratic government, the most progressive of its time. And it could have succeeded eventually if Lenin hadn't returned in April, sent by the Germans to undermine the Russian war effort and instigate riots." "Such slander! The July Days were a spontaneous and justified reaction against the government's failures. And Kerensky showed his true colors when he blamed Lenin and arrested and outlawed his Bolshevik party, forcing him to flee into exile again. Some democracy! It's a good thing the government collapsed under their own incompetence and greed when they tried to stage a military coup then had to ask the Bolsheviks for help when it backfired. After that, all Lenin had to do was return in October and take charge. The government was peacefully overthrown overnight." "But what the Bolsheviks did after gaining power wasn't very peaceful. How many people did they execute without trial? And was it really necessary to murder the tsar's entire family, even the children?" "Russia was being attacked by foreign imperialists, trying to restore the tsar. Any royal heir that was rescued would be recognized as ruler by foreign governments. It would've been the end of everything the people had fought so hard to achieve. Besides, Lenin may not have given the order." "But it was not only imperialists that the Bolsheviks killed. What about the purges and executions of other socialist and anarchist parties, their old allies? What about the Tambov Rebellion, where peasants, resisting grain confiscation, were killed with poison gas? Or sending the army to crush the workers in Kronstadt, who were demanding democratic self-management? Was this still fighting for the people?" "Yes! The measures were difficult, but it was a difficult time. The new government needed to secure itself while being attacked from all sides, so that the socialist order could be established." "And what good came of this socialist order? Even after the civil war was won, there were famines, repression and millions executed or sent to die in camps, while Lenin's successor Stalin established a cult of personality and absolute power." "That wasn't the plan. Lenin never cared for personal gains, even his enemies admitted that he fully believed in his cause, living modestly and working tirelessly from his student days until his too early death. He saw how power-hungry Stalin was and tried to warn the party, but it was too late." "And the decades of totalitarianism that followed after?" "You could call it that, but it was Lenin's efforts that changed Russia in a few decades from a backward and undeveloped monarchy full of illiterate peasants to a modern, industrial superpower, with one of the world's best educated populations, unprecedented opportunities for women, and some of the most important scientific advancements of the century. Life may not have been luxurious, but nearly everyone had a roof over their head and food on their plate, which few countries have achieved." "But these advances could still have happened, even without Lenin and the repressive regime he established." "Yes, and I could've been a famous rock and roll singer. But how would I have sounded?" We can never be sure how things could've unfolded if different people were in power or different decisions were made, but to avoid the mistakes of the past, we must always be willing to put historical figures on trial.

**Transcript**:
Every four seconds, someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. It's the most common cause of dementia, affecting over 40 million people worldwide, and yet finding a cure is something that still eludes researchers today. Dr. Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist, first described the symptoms in 1901 when he noticed that a particular hospital patient had some peculiar problems, including difficulty sleeping, disturbed memory, drastic mood changes, and increasing confusion. When the patient passed away, Alzheimer was able to do an autopsy and test his idea that perhaps her symptoms were caused by irregularities in the brain's structure. What he found beneath the microscope were visible differences in brain tissue in the form of misfolded proteins called plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. Those plaques and tangles work together to break down the brain's structure. Plaques arise when another protein in the fatty membrane surrounding nerve cells gets sliced up by a particular enzyme, resulting in beta-amyloid proteins, which are sticky and have a tendency to clump together. That clumping is what forms the things we know as plaques. These clumps block signaling and, therefore, communication between cells, and also seem to trigger immune reactions that cause the destruction of disabled nerve cells. In Alzheimer's disease, neurofibrillary tangles are built from a protein known as tau. The brain's nerve cells contain a network of tubes that act like a highway for food molecules among other things. Usually, the tau protein ensures that these tubes are straight, allowing molecules to pass through freely. But in Alzheimer's disease, the protein collapses into twisted strands or tangles, making the tubes disintegrate, obstructing nutrients from reaching the nerve cell and leading to cell death. The destructive pairing of plaques and tangles starts in a region called the hippocampus, which is responsible for forming memories. That's why short-term memory loss is usually the first symptom of Alzheimer's. The proteins then progressively invade other parts of the brain, creating unique changes that signal various stages of the disease. At the front of the brain, the proteins destroy the ability to process logical thoughts. Next, they shift to the region that controls emotions, resulting in erratic mood changes. At the top of the brain, they cause paranoia and hallucinations, and once they reach the brain's rear, the plaques and tangles work together to erase the mind's deepest memories. Eventually the control centers governing heart rate and breathing are overpowered as well resulting in death. The immensely destructive nature of this disease has inspired many researchers to look for a cure but currently they're focused on slowing its progression. One temporary treatment helps reduce the break down of acetylcholine, an important chemical messenger in the brain which is decreased in Alzheimer's patients due to the death of the nerve cells that make it. Another possible solution is a vaccine that trains the body's immune system to attack beta-amyloid plaques before they can form clumps. But we still need to find an actual cure. Alzheimer's disease was discovered more than a century ago, and yet still it is not well understood. Perhaps one day we'll grasp the exact mechanisms at work behind this threat and a solution will be unearthed.

**Transcript**:
Every four seconds, someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. It's the most common cause of dementia, affecting over 40 million people worldwide, and yet finding a cure is something that still eludes researchers today. Dr. Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist, first described the symptoms in 1901 when he noticed that a particular hospital patient had some peculiar problems, including difficulty sleeping, disturbed memory, drastic mood changes, and increasing confusion. When the patient passed away, Alzheimer was able to do an autopsy and test his idea that perhaps her symptoms were caused by irregularities in the brain's structure. What he found beneath the microscope were visible differences in brain tissue in the form of misfolded proteins called plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. Those plaques and tangles work together to break down the brain's structure. Plaques arise when another protein in the fatty membrane surrounding nerve cells gets sliced up by a particular enzyme, resulting in beta-amyloid proteins, which are sticky and have a tendency to clump together. That clumping is what forms the things we know as plaques. These clumps block signaling and, therefore, communication between cells, and also seem to trigger immune reactions that cause the destruction of disabled nerve cells. In Alzheimer's disease, neurofibrillary tangles are built from a protein known as tau. The brain's nerve cells contain a network of tubes that act like a highway for food molecules among other things. Usually, the tau protein ensures that these tubes are straight, allowing molecules to pass through freely. But in Alzheimer's disease, the protein collapses into twisted strands or tangles, making the tubes disintegrate, obstructing nutrients from reaching the nerve cell and leading to cell death. The destructive pairing of plaques and tangles starts in a region called the hippocampus, which is responsible for forming memories. That's why short-term memory loss is usually the first symptom of Alzheimer's. The proteins then progressively invade other parts of the brain, creating unique changes that signal various stages of the disease. At the front of the brain, the proteins destroy the ability to process logical thoughts. Next, they shift to the region that controls emotions, resulting in erratic mood changes. At the top of the brain, they cause paranoia and hallucinations, and once they reach the brain's rear, the plaques and tangles work together to erase the mind's deepest memories. Eventually the control centers governing heart rate and breathing are overpowered as well resulting in death. The immensely destructive nature of this disease has inspired many researchers to look for a cure but currently they're focused on slowing its progression. One temporary treatment helps reduce the break down of acetylcholine, an important chemical messenger in the brain which is decreased in Alzheimer's patients due to the death of the nerve cells that make it. Another possible solution is a vaccine that trains the body's immune system to attack beta-amyloid plaques before they can form clumps. But we still need to find an actual cure. Alzheimer's disease was discovered more than a century ago, and yet still it is not well understood. Perhaps one day we'll grasp the exact mechanisms at work behind this threat and a solution will be unearthed.

**Transcript**:
Sugar is playing hide and seek with you. You'd think it would be pretty easy for you to win, considering all the sugar in sodas, ice cream, candy, and big white bags labeled sugar. People get about half of their added sugars from those drinks and treats, so it might seem like sugar is hiding in plain sight, but like someone in the witness protection program, the other half is hidden in places you'd least suspect. Check the ingredients on ketchup, bologna, spaghetti sauce, soy milk, sports drinks, fish sticks, and peanut butter. You'll find sugar hiding in most of those products. In fact, you'll find added sugars in three-quarters of the more than 600,000 items available in grocery stores. But how is sugar hiding? Can't you just look on food labels? It's not that easy. Just like your friend Robert might go by Bob, Robby, Rob, Bobby, or Roberto, added sugar has a lot of aliases. And by a lot, we don't mean five or six, try fifty-six. There's brown rice syrup, barley malt, demerara, Florida Crystals, muscovado, and, of course, high fructose corn syrup, sometimes called HFCS, or corn sugar. Even sugar's tricky nicknames have nicknames. Grape or apple concentrate has the same effects on your body as its 55 sugary twins. And even though organic evaporated cane juice sounds healthy, when you evaporate it, you get sugar! Chemically speaking, it's all the same. And even trickier, when multiple added types of sugars are used in one type of product, they get buried down in a long list of ingredients, so the sugar content might appear to be okay, but when you add them all together, sugar can be the single biggest ingredient. Currently, the FDA doesn't suggest a recommended daily limit for sugar, so it's hard to tell if this 65 grams in a bottle of soda is a little or a lot. But the World Health Organization recommends limiting sugar to just 5% of your total calories, or about 25 grams per day. So, 65 grams is well over twice that amount. But just what is sugar? What's the difference between glucose and fructose? Well, both are carbohydrates with the same chemical composition of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But they have very different structures and behave quite differently in our bodies. Glucose is the best source of energy for nearly all organisms on Earth. It can be metabolized by all organs in the body. Fructose, on the other hand, is metabolized primarily in the liver, and when your liver gets overloaded with sweet, sweet fructose, the excess is metabolized to fat. Fresh fruits actually contain fructose, but it's naturally occurring and doesn't cause an overload because the fiber in fruit slows its absorption. This gives your liver the time it needs to do its job. It's sugar that makes cookies chewy and candy crunchy. It even turns bread crust a beautiful, golden brown. It's also a great preservative; it doesn't spoil or evaporate, so the foods it's added to are easier to store and ship long distances and tend to be cheaper. That's why sugar is hiding everywhere. Actually, it might be easier to list the foods that added sugar isn't hiding in, things like: vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, fruit, raw nuts, even your kitchen sink. Simply choosing water over soda, juices, and sports drinks is a great way to avoid hidden added sugar. At the very least, try to pay attention to food labels, so you can keep your sugar intake at a healthy level. Because in this game of hide and seek, every time you don't find added sugar, you win!

**Transcript**:
Sugar is playing hide and seek with you. You'd think it would be pretty easy for you to win, considering all the sugar in sodas, ice cream, candy, and big white bags labeled sugar. People get about half of their added sugars from those drinks and treats, so it might seem like sugar is hiding in plain sight, but like someone in the witness protection program, the other half is hidden in places you'd least suspect. Check the ingredients on ketchup, bologna, spaghetti sauce, soy milk, sports drinks, fish sticks, and peanut butter. You'll find sugar hiding in most of those products. In fact, you'll find added sugars in three-quarters of the more than 600,000 items available in grocery stores. But how is sugar hiding? Can't you just look on food labels? It's not that easy. Just like your friend Robert might go by Bob, Robby, Rob, Bobby, or Roberto, added sugar has a lot of aliases. And by a lot, we don't mean five or six, try fifty-six. There's brown rice syrup, barley malt, demerara, Florida Crystals, muscovado, and, of course, high fructose corn syrup, sometimes called HFCS, or corn sugar. Even sugar's tricky nicknames have nicknames. Grape or apple concentrate has the same effects on your body as its 55 sugary twins. And even though organic evaporated cane juice sounds healthy, when you evaporate it, you get sugar! Chemically speaking, it's all the same. And even trickier, when multiple added types of sugars are used in one type of product, they get buried down in a long list of ingredients, so the sugar content might appear to be okay, but when you add them all together, sugar can be the single biggest ingredient. Currently, the FDA doesn't suggest a recommended daily limit for sugar, so it's hard to tell if this 65 grams in a bottle of soda is a little or a lot. But the World Health Organization recommends limiting sugar to just 5% of your total calories, or about 25 grams per day. So, 65 grams is well over twice that amount. But just what is sugar? What's the difference between glucose and fructose? Well, both are carbohydrates with the same chemical composition of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But they have very different structures and behave quite differently in our bodies. Glucose is the best source of energy for nearly all organisms on Earth. It can be metabolized by all organs in the body. Fructose, on the other hand, is metabolized primarily in the liver, and when your liver gets overloaded with sweet, sweet fructose, the excess is metabolized to fat. Fresh fruits actually contain fructose, but it's naturally occurring and doesn't cause an overload because the fiber in fruit slows its absorption. This gives your liver the time it needs to do its job. It's sugar that makes cookies chewy and candy crunchy. It even turns bread crust a beautiful, golden brown. It's also a great preservative; it doesn't spoil or evaporate, so the foods it's added to are easier to store and ship long distances and tend to be cheaper. That's why sugar is hiding everywhere.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 2 does not ask about a specific type of sugar, I continued to analyze the generated MCQs and found that Question 8 is also related to the topic of added sugars, but it does not ask which one is not a kind of added sugar.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent, as it deals with the misleading nature of food labels when it comes to added sugars.

But, if I really had to choose one that has the closest relation to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that it is Question 2, as it talks about added sugars and their aliases.

**Transcript**:
Sugar is playing hide and seek with you. You'd think it would be pretty easy for you to win, considering all the sugar in sodas, ice cream, candy, and big white bags labeled sugar. People get about half of their added sugars from those drinks and treats, so it might seem like sugar is hiding in plain sight, but like someone in the witness protection program, the other half is hidden in places you'd least suspect. Check the ingredients on ketchup, bologna, spaghetti sauce, soy milk, sports drinks, fish sticks, and peanut butter. You'll find sugar hiding in most of those products. In fact, you'll find added sugars in three-quarters of the more than 600,000 items available in grocery stores. But how is sugar hiding? Can't you just look on food labels? It's not that easy. Just like your friend Robert might go by Bob, Robby, Rob, Bobby, or Roberto, added sugar has a lot of aliases. And by a lot, we don't mean five or six, try fifty-six. There's brown rice syrup, barley malt, demerara, Florida Crystals, muscovado, and, of course, high fructose corn syrup, sometimes called HFCS, or corn sugar. Even sugar's tricky nicknames have nicknames. Grape or apple concentrate has the same effects on your body as its 55 sugary twins. And even though organic evaporated cane juice sounds healthy, when you evaporate it, you get sugar! Chemically speaking, it's all the same. And even trickier, when multiple added types of sugars are used in one type of product, they get buried down in a long list of ingredients, so the sugar content might appear to be okay, but when you add them all together, sugar can be the single biggest ingredient. Currently, the FDA doesn't suggest a recommended daily limit for sugar, so it's hard to tell if this 65 grams in a bottle of soda is a little or a lot. But the World Health Organization recommends limiting sugar to just 5% of your total calories, or about 25 grams per day. So, 65 grams is well over twice that amount. But just what is sugar? What's the difference between glucose and fructose? Well, both are carbohydrates with the same chemical composition of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But they have very different structures and behave quite differently in our bodies. Glucose is the best source of energy for nearly all organisms on Earth. It can be metabolized by all organs in the body. Fructose, on the other hand, is metabolized primarily in the liver, and when your liver gets overloaded with sweet, sweet fructose, the excess is metabolized to fat. Fresh fruits actually contain fructose, but it's naturally occurring and doesn't cause an overload because the fiber in fruit slows its absorption. This gives your liver the time it needs to do its job. It's sugar that makes cookies chewy and candy crunchy. It even turns bread crust a beautiful, golden brown. It's also a great preservative; it doesn't spoil or evaporate, so the foods it's added to are easier to store and ship long distances and tend to be cheaper. That's why sugar is hiding everywhere. Actually, it might be easier to list the foods that added sugar isn't hiding in, things like: vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, fruit, raw nuts, even your kitchen sink. Simply choosing water over soda, juices, and sports drinks is a great way to avoid hidden added sugar. At the very least, try to pay attention to food labels, so you can keep your sugar intake at a healthy level. Because in this game of hide and seek, every time you don't find added sugar, you win!

**Transcript**:
Say you're helping plan a friend's party, and he sends you a text asking you to "bring Bob, a DJ and a clown." You're pretty impressed. You had no idea Bob was so multitalented. But when the day arrives, it turns out that he's not, and you were supposed to bring three different people. As you and Bob sit at the silent, clownless party, it occurs to you that the confusion could've been avoided simply by using another comma after DJ. This final comma in a list, placed directly before the main conjunction, such as and, or, or nor, is called the serial comma, or Oxford comma. And it has long driven grammar nerds crazy because even major language institutions can't agree on whether it should be used. Ironically, the Oxford comma is more common in the United States, where it's recommended by the MLA, the Chicago Style Manual, and the US Government Printing Office, though not by the AP Style Book. In the UK and other English-speaking countries, most style guides do not support the comma's use, with the exception of its namesake, the Oxford University Press. Why not use the serial comma? One of the main arguments is that the conjunction is usually enough to denote a separate entity. And where it's not, like in your ill-fated invite list, changing the order of terms will usually do the job. Journalists also dislike the comma because it takes up precious space and can make text look cluttered. Sometimes, it can even create confusion of its own. For example, if your friend had asked for "Bob, a DJ and a puppy," you'd probably figure out that they're three separate beings. Puppies are cute, but they don't make great DJs. With the comma, you may think Bob is the DJ, and all you need is him and the puppy. The argument over the Oxford comma has raised such strong passions over the years that a sort of truce has been reached. The common wisdom is that its use is optional, and depends on whether it will help to avoid confusion. For one thing, you're supposed to keep your use or avoidance of the Oxford comma consistent throughout a whole piece of writing. So, using it only where necessary is not an option. And the very idea of a grammatical rule being optional is a bit odd. Imagine that you hadn't messed up the party planning, and read the next day that "everyone had a great time - ninjas, pirates, vikings, old and young." If the Oxford comma were standard, you would notice it missing and conclude that old and young must describe the awesome guests already listed. But as things stand, you will always wonder whether it means that a bunch of regular, boring kids and old people showed up as well. Ultimately, the serial comma may be useful or annoying, but your opinion on it, as for many optional things, probably has something to do with whichever style you were raised on. Your high school teachers favored it? It's likely you're still using it. Your first editor hated it? You probably do, too. And maybe so much hairsplitting over a tiny squiggle on a page is a bit silly. After all, there are so many bigger problems to worry about. But sometimes, little things can make a big difference.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask where the Oxford comma is most prevalently used, it does provide information about institutions that recommend the use of the serial comma, which includes the MLA and the Oxford University Press, but not the AP Style Book. According to the transcript, the MLA and the Chicago Style Manual, and the US Government Printing Office recommend the use of the serial comma in the United States, while the AP Style Book does not. This implies that the Oxford comma is more commonly used in the United States.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. But Question 2 is the closest match based on the information provided.

**Transcript**:
Say you're helping plan a friend's party, and he sends you a text asking you to "bring Bob, a DJ and a clown." You're pretty impressed. You had no idea Bob was so multitalented. But when the day arrives, it turns out that he's not, and you were supposed to bring three different people. As you and Bob sit at the silent, clownless party, it occurs to you that the confusion could've been avoided simply by using another comma after DJ. This final comma in a list, placed directly before the main conjunction, such as and, or, or nor, is called the serial comma, or Oxford comma. And it has long driven grammar nerds crazy because even major language institutions can't agree on whether it should be used. Ironically, the Oxford comma is more common in the United States, where it's recommended by the MLA, the Chicago Style Manual, and the US Government Printing Office, though not by the AP Style Book. In the UK and other English-speaking countries, most style guides do not support the comma's use, with the exception of its namesake, the Oxford University Press. Why not use the serial comma? One of the main arguments is that the conjunction is usually enough to denote a separate entity. And where it's not, like in your ill-fated invite list, changing the order of terms will usually do the job. Journalists also dislike the comma because it takes up precious space and can make text look cluttered. Sometimes, it can even create confusion of its own. For example, if your friend had asked for "Bob, a DJ and a puppy," you'd probably figure out that they're three separate beings. Puppies are cute, but they don't make great DJs. With the comma, you may think Bob is the DJ, and all you need is him and the puppy. The argument over the Oxford comma has raised such strong passions over the years that a sort of truce has been reached. The common wisdom is that its use is optional, and depends on whether it will help to avoid confusion. For one thing, you're supposed to keep your use or avoidance of the Oxford comma consistent throughout a whole piece of writing. So, using it only where necessary is not an option. And the very idea of a grammatical rule being optional is a bit odd. Imagine that you hadn't messed up the party planning, and read the next day that "everyone had a great time - ninjas, pirates, vikings, old and young." If the Oxford comma were standard, you would notice it missing and conclude that old and young must describe the awesome guests already listed. But as things stand, you will always wonder whether it means that a bunch of regular, boring kids and old people showed up as well. Ultimately, the serial comma may be useful or annoying, but your opinion on it, as for many optional things, probably has something to do with whichever style you were raised on. Your high school teachers favored it? It's likely you're still using it. Your first editor hated it? You probably do, too. And maybe so much hairsplitting over a tiny squiggle on a page is a bit silly. After all, there are so many bigger problems to worry about. But sometimes, little things can make a big difference.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although the wording of the questions is different, the intent and content of Question 7 align with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks for arguments against using the comma, and one of the correct arguments is that the conjunction already denotes a list, making the comma superfluous. Question 7 explores the potential effect of not using the serial comma, which is related to the argument against using it. However, a more direct match is not available among the generated MCQs.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the arguments against using the serial comma. Since such a direct match is not available, Question 7 is the closest match based on the provided options.

However, if I were to rewrite Question 8 to match the ground truth MCQ more closely, it would be something like:

Question: What is one argument against using the serial comma?
Options: A. It is necessary for clarity, B. The conjunction already denotes a list, making it superfluous, C. It should be used in every sentence, D. It is only necessary in academic writing.

In its current form, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 7, but keep in mind that the match is not perfect.

**Transcript**:
We all know about the dinosaurs that once roamed the planet, but long after they went extinct, great beasts we call the megafauna lived on every continent. In the Americas, ground sloths the size of elephants pulled down trees with their claws. Saber-toothed cats the size of brown bears hunted in packs, but they were no match for short-faced bears, which stood thirteen feet on their hind legs, and are likely to have driven these cats away from their prey. There were armadillos as big as small cars, an eight foot beaver, and a bird with a 26 foot wingspan. Almost everywhere, the world's megafauna were driven to extinction, often by human hunters. Some species still survive in parts of Africa and Asia. In other places, you can still see the legacy of these great beasts. Most trees are able to resprout where their trunk is broken to withstand the loss of much of their bark and to survive splitting, twisting and trampling, partly because they evolved to survive attacks by elephants. The American pronghorn can run so fast because it evolved to escape the American cheetah. The surviving animals live in ghost ecosystems adapted to threats from species that no longer exist. Today, it may be possible to resurrect those ghosts, to bring back lost species using genetic material. For instance, there's been research in to cloning woolly mammoths from frozen remains. But even if it's not possible, we can still restore many of the ecosystems the world has lost. How? By making use of abandoned farms. As the market for food is globalized, infertile land becomes uncompetitive. Farmers in barren places can't compete with people growing crops on better land elsewhere. As a result, farming has started to retreat from many regions, and trees have started to return. One estimate claims that two-thirds of land in the US that was once forested but was cleared for farming has become forested again. Another estimate suggests that by 2030, an area in Europe the size of Poland will be vaccated by farmers. So even if we can't use DNA to bring back ground sloths and giant armadillos, we can restore bears, wolves, pumas lynx, moose and bison to the places where they used to live. Some of these animals can reshape their surroundings, creating conditions that allow other species to thrive. When wolves were reintroduced to the Yellowstone National Park in 1995, they quickly transformed the ecosystem. Where they reduced the numbers of overpopulated deer, vegetation began to recover. The height of some trees quintupled in just six years. As forests returned, so did songbirds. Beavers, which eat trees, multiplied in the rivers, and their dams provided homes for otters, muskrats, ducks, frogs and fish. The wolves killed coyotes, allowing rabbits and mice to increase, providing more food for hawks, weasels, foxes and badgers. Bald eagles and ravens fed on the carrion that the wolves abandoned. So did bears, which also ate the berries on the returning shrubs. Bison numbers rose as they browsed the revitalized forests. The wolves changed almost everything. This is an example of a trophic cascade, a change at the top of the food chain that tumbles all the way to the bottom, affecting every level. The discovery of widespread trophic cascades may be one of the most exciting scientific findings of the past half century. They tell us that ecosystems that have lost just one or two species of large animals can behave in radically different ways from those that retain them. All over the world, new movements are trying to catalyze the restoration of nature in a process called rewilding. This means undoing some of the damage we've caused, reestablishing species which have been driven out, and then stepping back. There is no attempt to create an ideal ecosystem, to produce a heath, a rainforest or a coral reef. Rewilding is about bringing back the species that drive dynamic processes and then letting nature take its course. But it's essential that rewilding must never be used as an excuse to push people off the land. It should happen only with the consent and enthusiasm of the people who work there. Imagine standing on a cliff in England, watching sperm whales attacking shoals of herring as they did within sight of the shore until the 18th century. By creating marine reserves in which no commerical fishing takes place, that can happen again. Imagine a European Serengeti full of the animals that used to live there: hippos, rhinos, elephants, hyenas and lions. What rewilding reintroduces, alongside the missing animals and plants, is that rare species called hope. It tells us that ecological change need not always proceed in the same direction. The silent spring could be followed by a wild summer.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ is about the "keystone species" that has reshaped the ecology of Yellowstone National Park. Although there isn't a direct match, Question 9 discusses the concept of a trophic cascade, which is related to the idea of a keystone species. Nevertheless, it's not a perfect match.

If I had to choose the closest match based on the content and intent, I would suggest Question 9 as a potential candidate, but with a note that it's not an exact match.

However, since the provided generated MCQs do not explicitly mention the "keystone species" concept or the specific example from Yellowstone National Park, I must conclude that there isn't a direct match.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ. Alternatively, I can assist in creating new generated MCQs that better align with the ground truth MCQs. Please let me know how I can further assist you.

So did bears, which also ate the berries on the returning shrubs. Bison numbers rose as they browsed the revitalized forests. The wolves changed almost everything. This is an example of a trophic cascade, a change at the top of the food chain that tumbles all the way to the bottom, affecting every level. The discovery of widespread trophic cascades may be one of the most exciting scientific findings of the past half century. They tell us that ecosystems that have lost just one or two species of large animals can behave in radically different ways from those that retain them. All over the world, new movements are trying to catalyze the restoration of nature in a process called rewilding. This means undoing some of the damage we've caused, reestablishing species which have been driven out, and then stepping back. There is no attempt to create an ideal ecosystem, to produce a heath, a rainforest or a coral reef. Rewilding is about bringing back the species that drive dynamic processes and then letting nature take its course. But it's essential that rewilding must never be used as an excuse to push people off the land. It should happen only with the consent and enthusiasm of the people who work there. Imagine standing on a cliff in England, watching sperm whales attacking shoals of herring as they did within sight of the shore until the 18th century. By creating marine reserves in which no commerical fishing takes place, that can happen again. Imagine a European Serengeti full of the animals that used to live there: hippos, rhinos, elephants, hyenas and lions. What rewilding reintroduces, alongside the missing animals and plants, is that rare species called hope. It tells us that ecological change need not always proceed in the same direction. The silent spring could be followed by a wild summer.

So krypton is one of the noble gases, it’s
not very reactive but it does react with the element fluorine. Jim Turner,
who was my supervisor when I did my doctorate, was the first person
to discover that fluorine could react with krypton but even that reaction
requires quite bright lights to break the bond between the fluorine
atoms to get them to react. But krypton can also be used in lasers
when mixtures of krypton and of fluorine-containing compound can be
used to generate very bright pulses or intense pulses of ultraviolet light.
Some years ago we had a professor here who bought a really big krypton-fluoride
laser and when he switched it on and the beam hit the wall
it burnt a hole right through the wall so he knew where to make the hole
to get his beam into the next lab.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: How does krypton's noble gas properties affect its reactivity? 

However, this question doesn't perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated question that directly asks about krypton's reactivity with other elements.

A closer match would be a combination of the content in Question 7 and the options in the ground truth MCQ. Since this isn't directly available, the next best option is to choose a question that at least partially addresses the reactivity of krypton.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say Question 7 is the closest match, but with a low confidence level.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about krypton's reactivity with other elements, which is not available in the provided options.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of fruits and vegetables that we depend on pollinators for. While there isn't a generated MCQ that directly asks this question, Question 1 mentions a specific statistic (35 years) related to the speaker's experience filming time-lapse flowers.

A more relevant generated MCQ might be one that discusses the importance of pollinators or their role in food production. Among the options, Question 6 is the closest match, as it asks about the importance of pollinators and how understanding their role can inspire individuals to take action. However, it does not specifically ask about the percentage of fruits and vegetables.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would select Question 6, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
The politics of 19th Century Europe were messy. (What's changed?) It was made up of various Empires spreading across the world, trying to show each other who was the biggest power.  They each built up massive armies to stave off war, thinking that everyone else would be too scared to fight against them, or so they thought... Things all changed when a gang of Yugoslav nationalists who didn't like being part of Austria-Hungary shot the Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand while he was in Sarajevo. Swiftly the Austro-Hungarian Empire declared war on Serbia. Russia came in to aid Serbia, so Germany decided to declare war on Russia! Knowing that France would go to war with Germany, Germany decided to attack France quickly and invaded via neutral Belgium and Luxembourg and because of this, Great Britain stepped in to stop the Germans getting any closer. It was a mess of allegiances and old rivalries with two sides forming the allies and the central powers.  And so began what became known at the time as The Great War; the war to end all wars! A new form of warfare evolved as these fully industrialized armies with engines, machine guns, airplanes and new chemical gas weapons fought against each other.  It was the dawn of modern warfare.  At the time, national pride was at an all-time high and men were proud to go off and fight for their country. It was seen as a romantic idea to go off and be a hero! Boys as young as 12 managed to lie their way into the army ranks only to discover that it was not such a sweet and honourable thing to die for one's country!  Germany marched on Paris but was stopped by the French and both sides dug themselves into trenches in what became known as the Western Front.  On the Eastern Front, the Russians invaded Austria-Hungary but were stopped in Eastern Prussia by the Germans.  The Ottoman Empire joined in on the site of the Central Powers in 1914.  More and More nations from all over the world joined the fight as the war spread across Europe. Trench warfare was quite terrible.  Each army would dig a long network of trenches in the ground, fortifying the front with barbed wire and sandbags. I was a long stalemate where neither side dared advance on the other. Machine guns were a new and very effective weapon. When the time was right, the army would climb up over the top and charge across no-man's land to the enemy trench and capture it, thus gaining more land and taking another step towards their goal!  At least that was the plan... Spirits were high at least when the first Christmas came by.  Both forces climbed out of their trenches to celebrate Christmas together, talk, share stories and play football.  When Christmas ended, they would climb back into their trenches to become enemies once again. Conditions in the trenches were dreadful. 
 Soldiers in France and Belgium found their feet rotting away from the constant damp. In contrast, Australian, New Zealand and Ottoman soldiers fighting in Gallipoli had blisteringly hot trenches where rain and cold were replaced with dehydration and overheating.  Disease was everywhere in the trenches. 1916 saw a renewed push on the Western Front from both sides.  Thousands of French died at Verdun as the Germans unleashed their chlorine gas. The infamous Battle of the Somme was a long and grueling battle that lasted from July to November.  The first day alone saw over 80,000 men wounded or killed; mostly British, due to disastrous attacks. Fundamental errors and contradictions from the high command led to confusion and unclear plans. In places, soldiers weren't organized in time to charge so by the time that they got going, the artillery had stopped firing on the Germans, allowing them to easily fire upon their attackers. 
 Planes and artillery were supposed to clear the German barbed wire, but the shrapnel was ineffective against the wire. When the order came to go over the top, thousands of men ran out to their death to be caught on the barbed wire and picked off one by one by the German machine guns. this battle saw the first use of tanks by the British. Ultimately, France and Britain pushed against Germany and gained much ground.  By Christmas 1916, no man wanted good cheer wished upon their faceless enemy.  During 1916 also, before the Somme, Irish Republicans staged an uprising in Dublin in the hopes to catch Britain while they were distracted by the war. It was crushed by Britain but after executing the rebel leaders Irish support for Britain and the war dropped, at least in the south of Ireland. Most Irish troops after that came from the Protestant North. On the sea Britain mined many patches of international water to stop movement of German ships. Germany was blockaded.  After many naval battles, Britain tried to stay in control of the seas, above the water at least! Germany were on the attack with the u-boat submarines adding a new dimension to Naval Warfare; they could attack without warning!  They sank many ships including the ship The Lusitania and because this broke loads of war rules, it ultimately influenced the United States of America to enter the war... two years later!  The British pushed up through the Arabian peninsula with T.E. Lawrence aka Lawrence of Arabia helping to organize the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. In 1917, the Russians had a series of revolutions. In the February Revolution, the Tsars were gotten rid of, but Russia remained in the war, and the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks took control and brought power to the people and sowed the seeds for Communism in Russia. The Russians signed a treaty with Germany and pulled out of the war causing an initial difficulty for the enemies of the Central Powers.  The Allies however became refreshed with reinforcements from the United States of America who eventually decided to enter the war in 1917 after Germany tried to convince Mexico to attack them. Germany made a fierce and effective push before the allies could use their advantage.  However, American troops continued to arrive in such great numbers that Germany's army couldn't last any longer. The allies pushed up from Italy, the Balkans, and the Middle East putting Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire out of the war.  As the allies advanced the Western Front, Germany called for an armistice to stop the fighting, bringing victory to the allies and an end to the war.  The fighting stopped on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, 1918.  It took six months to negotiate terms and it was ultimately decided that the Central Powers were to pay for the damages they had caused in the war.  Germany only fully paid off this debt in 2010.  The map of Europe was redrawn. Soldiers who made it home again were changed men.  They were haunted by the horrors which they had seen in the trenches. Gas attacks, friends dying by their side, and the constant shelling of enemy artillery; they were shell-shocked and so many found it impossible to go back to normal life after the trenches.  Many great poets and writers were inspired by their hell in the trenches such as Wilfred Owen, JRR Tolkien and Ernest Hemingway of the so-called Lost Generation? Some survived, many did not. The world was a changed place after the World War. People had seen the death and destruction that could be dealt by mankind. The men who left to become heroes came back scarred, or worse never returned at all. The poppy is used to remember the millions who died in this war as it was just about the only flower to grow in the carnage-ridden wasteland between the trenches. The world was now a darker place.  People hoped that it would indeed be the war to end all wars! Unfortunately, they were mistaken...

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about a specific WWI battle that caused more than 80,000 deaths in the first day of the battle. The most similar generated MCQ is not available, but Question 6 is somewhat related to WWI warfare.

However, I must note that Question 6 does not specifically ask about the Battle of the Somme or the number of deaths on the first day of the battle.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose:

 None of the questions is a good match, however, Question 8 discusses the impact of new technologies and tactics during World War I and mentions that "It changed the nature of warfare, making it more destructive and deadly", this question is the closest one but it is still not a good match.

It would be best to generate new MCQs that are more specific to the content of the ground truth MCQ.

it's a great honor today to share with you the digital universe which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe and so I think we can roll the video that we have the flat horizon that we've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste it wasn't until we really left earth got above the atmosphere and seen the horizon been back on itself that we could understand our planet as a limited condition the digital universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past twelve years and we maintain that put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales what we see here are satellites around the earth and the earth in proper registration against the universe as we see NASA supported this work twelve years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world the digital universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do our main space shows in the dome but what you see here is a result of actually internships that we hosted with Lynn shipping University in Sweden and I've had 12 students work on this for their graduate work and the result has been this software called uni view and a company called schists in sweden this software allows interactive use and so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth matters on the lower east side of Manhattan where I live and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan art for a exhibit on comparative cosmology and so as we move out we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies as we see here light travel time giving you a sense of how far away we are as we move out the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long we're essentially backing up into the path we back so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us the afterglow of the Big Bang this is the w map microwave background that we see will fly outside it here just to see the sort of containment if we were outside this it would almost be meaningless in the census before time but this is our containment of the visible universe we know the universe is bigger not which we can see coming back quickly we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning but these are positions latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped and our Sun here obviously with our own solar system but you're going to see we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system these are the paths Voyager 1 Voyager 2 Pioneer 11 and pioneer 10 the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system coming in closer picking up Earth orbit of the moon and we see the earth this map can be updated and we can add in new data I know dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera pie for the Cassini mission but here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color-coded four different mission phases ingeniously developed so that 45 encounters with the largest moon Titan which is larger than the planet Mercury diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase the software allows us to come close and look at parts of this the software can also be networked between domes we have a growing user base of this when we network domes and we can network between domes and classrooms we're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia and the Cambodians have actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school this is an image from Saturday photographed by the Aqua satellite but through the univ ii software and so you're seeing the edge of the earth this is Nepal this is in fact right here is the valley of Lhasa right here in Tibet but we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges Valley down below in India this is Nepal and Tibet and just in closing it's like to say this beautiful world that we live on here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave and coming out so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is because our home is the universe and we are the universe essentially we carry that in us and to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all I think in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe thank you you

A national hero? Or public enemy number one? Historical figures are often controversial, but few were as deified or vilified in their lifetime as the seventh President of the United States. This is History vs. Andrew Jackson. "Order, order, hm, uh, what were we...ah yes, Mr. Jackson! You stand accused of degrading the office of the presidency, causing financial collapse and wanton cruelty against American Indians. How do you plead?" "Now, Your Honor, I am not a big city lawyer, but I do know a few things. And I know that President Jackson was a self-made frontiersman, a great general, a real man of the people." "Your Honor, this 'man of the people' was a gambler, a drunk, and a brawler. Why, I've heard it said that he would fight at the drop of the hat and then drop the hat himself. I ask you, was such a man fit for the most distinguished office in the nation? Can we forget the debacle of his inauguration? Who ever heard of inviting a drunken mob into the White House? It took ages to get the upholstery clean." "That drunken mob, sir, was the American people, and they deserve to celebrate their victory." "Order, order! Now, did this celebration have pie?" "Very well. Mr. Jackson, is it not the case that immediately upon assuming office you introduced the spoils system, replacing hundreds of perfectly good federal employees with incompetent party loyalists?" "Your Honor, the President did no such thing. He tried to institute rotation in office to avoid any profiteering or funny business. It was the rest of the party who insisted on giving posts to their lackeys." "But Mr. Jackson complied, did he not?" "Now, uh, see here." "Moving on. Mr. Jackson, did you not help to cause the financial Panic of 1837, and the ensuing economic depression with your obsessive war against the Bank of the United States? Was not vetoing its reauthorization, as you did in 1832, an act of irresponsible populace pandering that made no economic sense?" "Your Honor, the gentleman has quite the imagination. That bank was just a way for rich Yanks to get richer. And all that money panic was caused when British banks raised interest rates and cut lending. To blame it on the President is preposterous, I say." "But if Mr. Jackson had not destroyed the National Bank, it would have been able to lend to farmers and businesses when other credit dried up, would it not?" "Hm, this is all highly speculative. Can we move on?" "Certainly, Your Honor. We now come to Mr. Jackson's most terrible offense: forcing entire tribes out of their native lands via the Indian Removal Act." "I resent that accusation, sir. The U.S. of A. bought that land from the Indians fair and square." "Do you call coercion and threats by a nation with a far more powerful army fair and square? Or signing a treaty for removing the Cherokee with a small group that didn't include their actual leaders? They didn't have time to properly supply themselves before the army came and forced them to march the Trail of Tears." "Now, hold on a minute. This was all Van Buren's doing after President Jackson left office." "But Mr. Jackson laid the groundwork and made sure the treaty was ratified. All President Van Buren had to do afterwards was enforce it." "Look here, Your Honor. Our government's been purchasing Indian land since the beginning, and my client was negotiating these deals even before he was President. President Jackson truly believed it was best for the Indians to get compensated for their land and move out West, where there was plenty of space for them to keep living the way they were accustomed, rather than stick around and keep butting heads with the white settlers. Some of whom, I remind our court, wanted to exterminate them outright. It was a different time." "And yet, even in this different time, there were many in Congress and even the Supreme Court who saw how wrong the Removal Act was and loudly opposed it, were there not?" "My client was under a great deal of pressure. I say, do you think it's easy governing such a huge country and keeping the Union together, when states are fixing to nullify federal laws? President Jackson barely got South Carolina to back down over those import tariffs, and then Georgia had to go discover gold and start grabbing up Cherokee land. It was either get the Indians to move or get in another fight with a state government." "So, you admit that Mr. Jackson sacrified moral principles to achieve some political goals?" "I do declare, show me one leader who hasn't." As societies change and morals evolve, yesterday's hero may become tomorrow's villain, or vice versa. History may be past, but our understanding of it is always on trial.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

However, Question 3 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about Andrew Jackson's intention behind introducing the spoils system rather than defining what the spoils system is.

A more similar question would be one that asks about the definition of the spoils system, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs. 

Among the generated MCQs, Questions 13 and 14 are related to the spoils system, but they ask about comparisons or similar systems rather than defining what the spoils system is.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the characteristic of Andrew Jackson that common people did not identify with. The correct answer is "His personal wealth."

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is the closest in terms of theme and intent. It asks about how many people viewed Andrew Jackson's presidency, and the correct answer is "As a time of controversy, with some viewing him as a hero and others as a villain." However, this question does not specifically ask about Jackson's characteristics.

A more relevant question would be one that asks about Jackson's characteristics or how people perceived him. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about this topic.

**Transcript**:
A national hero? Or public enemy number one? Historical figures are often controversial, but few were as deified or vilified in their lifetime as the seventh President of the United States. This is History vs. Andrew Jackson. "Order, order, hm, uh, what were we...ah yes, Mr. Jackson! You stand accused of degrading the office of the presidency, causing financial collapse and wanton cruelty against American Indians. How do you plead?" "Now, Your Honor, I am not a big city lawyer, but I do know a few things. And I know that President Jackson was a self-made frontiersman, a great general, a real man of the people." "Your Honor, this 'man of the people' was a gambler, a drunk, and a brawler. Why, I've heard it said that he would fight at the drop of the hat and then drop the hat himself. I ask you, was such a man fit for the most distinguished office in the nation? Can we forget the debacle of his inauguration? Who ever heard of inviting a drunken mob into the White House? It took ages to get the upholstery clean." "That drunken mob, sir, was the American people, and they deserve to celebrate their victory." "Order, order! Now, did this celebration have pie?" "Very well. Mr. Jackson, is it not the case that immediately upon assuming office you introduced the spoils system, replacing hundreds of perfectly good federal employees with incompetent party loyalists?" "Your Honor, the President did no such thing. He tried to institute rotation in office to avoid any profiteering or funny business. It was the rest of the party who insisted on giving posts to their lackeys." "But Mr. Jackson complied, did he not?" "Now, uh, see here." "Moving on. Mr. Jackson, did you not help to cause the financial Panic of 1837, and the ensuing economic depression with your obsessive war against the Bank of the United States? Was not vetoing its reauthorization, as you did in 1832, an act of irresponsible populace pandering that made no economic sense?" "Your Honor, the gentleman has quite the imagination. That bank was just a way for rich Yanks to get richer. And all that money panic was caused when British banks raised interest rates and cut lending. To blame it on the President is preposterous, I say." "But if Mr. Jackson had not destroyed the National Bank, it would have been able to lend to farmers and businesses when other credit dried up, would it not?" "Hm, this is all highly speculative. Can we move on?" "Certainly, Your Honor. We now come to Mr. Jackson's most terrible offense: forcing entire tribes out of their native lands via the Indian Removal Act." "I resent that accusation, sir. The U.S. of A. bought that land from the Indians fair and square." "Do you call coercion and threats by a nation with a far more powerful army fair and square? Or signing a treaty for removing the Cherokee with a small group that didn't include their actual leaders? They didn't have time to properly supply themselves before the army came and forced them to march the Trail of Tears." "Now, hold on a minute. This was all Van Buren's doing after President Jackson left office." "But Mr. Jackson laid the groundwork and made sure the treaty was ratified. All President Van Buren had to do afterwards was enforce it." "Look here, Your Honor. Our government's been purchasing Indian land since the beginning, and my client was negotiating these deals even before he was President. President Jackson truly believed it was best for the Indians to get compensated for their land and move out West, where there was plenty of space for them to keep living the way they were accustomed, rather than stick around and keep butting heads with the white settlers. Some of whom, I remind our court, wanted to exterminate them outright. It was a different time." "And yet, even in this different time, there were many in Congress and even the Supreme Court who saw how wrong the Removal Act was and loudly opposed it, were there not?" "My client was under a great deal of pressure. I say, do you think it's easy governing such a huge country and keeping the Union together, when states are fixing to nullify federal laws? President Jackson barely got South Carolina to back down over those import tariffs, and then Georgia had to go discover gold and start grabbing up Cherokee land. It was either get the Indians to move or get in another fight with a state government." "So, you admit that Mr. Jackson sacrified moral principles to achieve some political goals?" "I do declare, show me one leader who hasn't." As societies change and morals evolve, yesterday's hero may become tomorrow's villain, or vice versa. History may be past, but our understanding of it is always on trial.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7, but it doesn't ask about a specific tribe. However, Question 2 and Question 7 both deal with the Indian Removal Act and its consequences, but they don't specifically ask which tribe was relocated.

A more specific match is not available in the provided generated MCQs, but Question 2 is the closest one because it deals with the Trail of Tears, which is a consequence of the Indian Removal Act, and it specifically mentions the Cherokee people in the transcript, although not in the question itself.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar generated MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the Nullification Crisis and how Andrew Jackson prevented a state from seceding. While there isn't a direct match, Question 4 does mention controversy surrounding Andrew Jackson's presidency, which could be tangentially related to the Nullification Crisis.

However, a more relevant question would be one that directly addresses the Nullification Crisis or Andrew Jackson's actions in relation to state secession. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the questions are a good match. However, if you'd like me to pick one that is somewhat related to the broader topic of Andrew Jackson's presidency, I would suggest Question 4 (index 4) or Question 11 (index 11), which both discuss the controversy and legacy of Andrew Jackson's presidency.

Please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly addresses the Nullification Crisis and Andrew Jackson's actions in relation to state secession.

**Transcript**:
A banker in London sends the latest stock info to his colleagues in Hong Kong in less than a second. With a single click, a customer in New York orders electronics made in Beijing, transported across the ocean within days by cargo plane or container ship. The speed and volume at which goods and information move across the world today is unprecedented in history. But global exchange itself is older than we think, reaching back over 2,000 years along a 5,000 mile stretch known as the Silk Road. The Silk Road wasn't actually a single road, but a network of multiple routes that gradually emerged over centuries, connecting to various settlements and to each other thread by thread. The first agricultural civilizations were isolated places in fertile river valleys, their travel impeded by surrounding geography and fear of the unknown. But as they grew, they found that the arid deserts and steps on their borders were inhabited, not by the demons of folklore, but nomadic tribes on horseback. The Scythians, who ranged from Hungary to Mongolia, had come in contact with the civilizations of Greece, Egypt, India and China. These encounters were often less than peaceful. But even through raids and warfare, as well as trade and protection of traveling merchants in exchange for tariffs, the nomads began to spread goods, ideas and technologies between cultures with no direct contact. One of the most important strands of this growing web was the Persian Royal Road, completed by Darius the First in the 5th century BCE. Stretching nearly 2,000 miles from the Tigris River to the Aegean Sea, its regular relay points allowed goods and messages to travel at nearly 1/10 the time it would take a single traveler. With Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia, and expansion into Central Asia through capturing cities like Samarkand, and establishing new ones like Alexandria Eschate, the network of Greek, Egyptian, Persian and Indian culture and trade extended farther east than ever before, laying the foundations for a bridge between China and the West. This was realized in the 2nd century BCE, when an ambassador named Zhang Qian, sent to negotiate with nomads in the West, returned to the Han Emperor with tales of sophisticated civilizations, prosperous trade and exotic goods beyond the western borders. Ambassadors and merchants were sent towards Persia and India to trade silk and jade for horses and cotton, along with armies to secure their passage. Eastern and western routes gradually linked together into an integrated system spanning Eurasia, enabling cultural and commercial exhange farther than ever before. Chinese goods made their way to Rome, causing an outflow of gold that led to a ban on silk, while Roman glassware was highly prized in China. Military expeditions in Central Asia also saw encounters between Chinese and Roman soldiers. Possibly even transmitting crossbow technology to the Western world. Demand for exotic and foreign goods and the profits they brought, kept the strands of the Silk Road in tact, even as the Roman Empire disintegrated and Chinese dynasties rose and fell. Even Mongolian hoards, known for pillage and plunder, actively protected the trade routes, rather than disrupting them. But along with commodities, these routes also enabled the movement of traditions, innovations, ideologies and languages. Originating in India, Buddhism migrated to China and Japan to become the dominant religion there. Islam spread from the Arabian Penninsula into South Asia, blending with native beliefs and leading to new faiths, like Sikhism. And gunpowder made its way from China to the Middle East forging the futures of the Ottoman, Safavid and Mughul Empires. In a way, the Silk Road's success led to its own demise as new maritime technologies, like the magnetic compass, found their way to Europe, making long land routes obsolete. Meanwhile, the collapse of Mongol rule was followed by China's withdrawal from international trade. But even though the old routes and networks did not last, they had changed the world forever and there was no going back. Europeans seeking new maritime routes to the riches they knew awaited in East Asia led to the Age of Exploration and expansion into Africa and the Americas. Today, global interconnectedness shapes our lives like never before. Canadian shoppers buy t-shirts made in Bangladesh, Japanese audiences watch British television shows, and Tunisians use American software to launch a revolution. The impact of globalization on culture and economy is indisputable. But whatever its benefits and drawbacks, it is far from a new phenomenon. And though the mountains, deserts and oceans that once separated us are now circumvented through super sonic vehicles, cross-continental communication cables, and signals beamed through space rather than caravans traveling for months, none of it would have been possible without the pioneering cultures whose efforts created the Silk Road: history's first world wide web.

**Transcript**:
A banker in London sends the latest stock info to his colleagues in Hong Kong in less than a second. With a single click, a customer in New York orders electronics made in Beijing, transported across the ocean within days by cargo plane or container ship. The speed and volume at which goods and information move across the world today is unprecedented in history. But global exchange itself is older than we think, reaching back over 2,000 years along a 5,000 mile stretch known as the Silk Road. The Silk Road wasn't actually a single road, but a network of multiple routes that gradually emerged over centuries, connecting to various settlements and to each other thread by thread. The first agricultural civilizations were isolated places in fertile river valleys, their travel impeded by surrounding geography and fear of the unknown. But as they grew, they found that the arid deserts and steps on their borders were inhabited, not by the demons of folklore, but nomadic tribes on horseback.

Translator: Jessica Ruby
Reviewer: Caroline Cristal Let's say that it would take you
ten minutes to solve this puzzle. How long would it take if you received constant
electric shocks to your hands? Longer, right? Because the pain would distract
you from the task. Well, maybe not; it depends on how you handle pain. Some people are distracted by pain. It takes them longer to complete a task,
and they do it less well. Other people use tasks to distract
themselves from pain, and those people actually do the task faster and better when they're in pain than when they're not. Some people can just send
their mind wandering to distract themselves from pain. How can different people be subjected to the exact
same painful stimulus and yet experience
the pain so differently? And why does this matter? First of all, what is pain? Pain is an unpleasant sensory
and emotional experience, associated with actual
or potential tissue damage. Pain is something we experience, so it's best measured
by what you say it is. Pain has an intensity; you can describe it on a scale from zero, no pain, to ten,
the most pain imaginable. But pain also has a character, like sharp, dull, burning, or aching. What exactly creates these
perceptions of pain? Well, when you get hurt, special tissue damage-sensing nerve cells, called nociceptors, fire and send signals to the spinal cord
and then up to the brain. Processing work gets done
by cells called neurons and glia. This is your Grey matter. And brain superhighways carry information
as electrical impulses from one area to another. This is your white matter. The superhighway that carries
pain information from the spinal cord to the brain is our sensing pathway that ends in the cortex, a part of the brain
that decides what to do with the pain signal. Another system
of interconnected brain cells called the salience network decides what to pay attention to. Since pain can have serious consequences, the pain signal immediately activates
the salience network. Now, you're paying attention. The brain also responds to the pain and has to cope with these pain signals. So, motor pathways are activated to take your hand off
a hot stove, for example. But modulation networks are also activated that deliver endorphins and enkephalins, chemicals released when you're in pain
or during extreme exercise, creating the runner's high. These chemical systems help
regulate and reduce pain. All these networks
and pathways work together to create your pain experience, to prevent further tissue damage, and help you to cope with pain. This system is similar for everyone, but the sensitivity and efficacy
of these brain circuits determines how much
you feel and cope with pain. This is why some people have
greater pain than others and why some develop chronic pain that does not respond to treatment, while others respond well. Variability in pain sensitivities is not so different
than all kinds of variability in responses to other stimuli. Like how some people love roller coasters, but other people suffer
from terrible motion sickness. Why does it matter
that there is variability in our pain brain circuits? Well, there are many treatments for pain, targeting different systems. For mild pain,
non-prescription medications can act on cells
where the pain signals start. Other stronger pain
medicines and anesthetics work by reducing the activity

system, or endorphins. Some people can cope with pain
using methods that involve distraction, relaxation, meditation, yoga, or strategies that can be taught,

Translator: Jessica Ruby
Reviewer: Caroline Cristal Let's say that it would take you
ten minutes to solve this puzzle. How long would it take if you received constant
electric shocks to your hands? Longer, right? Because the pain would distract
you from the task. Well, maybe not; it depends on how you handle pain. Some people are distracted by pain. It takes them longer to complete a task,
and they do it less well. Other people use tasks to distract
themselves from pain, and those people actually do the task faster and better when they're in pain than when they're not. Some people can just send
their mind wandering to distract themselves from pain. How can different people be subjected to the exact
same painful stimulus and yet experience
the pain so differently? And why does this matter? First of all, what is pain? Pain is an unpleasant sensory
and emotional experience, associated with actual
or potential tissue damage. Pain is something we experience, so it's best measured
by what you say it is. Pain has an intensity; you can describe it on a scale from zero, no pain, to ten,
the most pain imaginable. But pain also has a character, like sharp, dull, burning, or aching. What exactly creates these
perceptions of pain? Well, when you get hurt, special tissue damage-sensing nerve cells, called nociceptors, fire and send signals to the spinal cord
and then up to the brain. Processing work gets done
by cells called neurons and glia. This is your Grey matter. And brain superhighways carry information
as electrical impulses from one area to another. This is your white matter. The superhighway that carries
pain information from the spinal cord to the brain is our sensing pathway that ends in the cortex, a part of the brain
that decides what to do with the pain signal. Another system
of interconnected brain cells called the salience network decides what to pay attention to. Since pain can have serious consequences, the pain signal immediately activates
the salience network. Now, you're paying attention. The brain also responds to the pain and has to cope with these pain signals. So, motor pathways are activated to take your hand off
a hot stove, for example. But modulation networks are also activated that deliver endorphins and enkephalins, chemicals released when you're in pain
or during extreme exercise, creating the runner's high. These chemical systems help
regulate and reduce pain. All these networks
and pathways work together to create your pain experience, to prevent further tissue damage, and help you to cope with pain. This system is similar for everyone, but the sensitivity and efficacy
of these brain circuits determines how much
you feel and cope with pain. This is why some people have
greater pain than others and why some develop chronic pain that does not respond to treatment, while others respond well. Variability in pain sensitivities is not so different
than all kinds of variability in responses to other stimuli. Like how some people love roller coasters, but other people suffer
from terrible motion sickness. Why does it matter
that there is variability in our pain brain circuits? Well, there are many treatments for pain, targeting different systems. For mild pain,
non-prescription medications can act on cells
where the pain signals start. Other stronger pain
medicines and anesthetics work by reducing the activity
in pain-sensing circuits or boosting our coping
system, or endorphins. Some people can cope with pain
using methods that involve distraction, relaxation, meditation, yoga, or strategies that can be taught,
like cognitive behavioral therapy. For some people who suffer
from severe chronic pain, that is pain that doesn't go away months after their injury

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the biblical story 
of the Tower of Babel, all of humanity once spoke 
a single language until they suddenly split
into many groups unable to understand each other. We don't really know if 
such an original language ever existed, but we do know that the thousands 
of languages existing today can be traced back 
to a much smaller number. So how did we end up with so many? In the early days of human migration, the world was much less populated. Groups of people that shared
a single language and culture often split into smaller tribes, going separate ways in search 
of fresh game and fertile land. As they migrated and 
settled in new places, they became isolated from one another and developed in different ways. Centuries of living 
in different conditions, eating different food and encountering different neighbors turned similar dialects with
varied pronunciation and vocabulary into radically different languages, continuing to divide as populations 
grew and spread out further. Like genealogists, modern linguists
try to map this process by tracing multiple languages 
back as far as they can to their common ancestor, 
or protolanguage. A group of all languages related 
in this way is called a language family, which can contain 
many branches and sub-families. So how do we determine whether 
languages are related in the first place? Similar sounding words don't tell us much. They could be false cognates 
or just directly borrowed terms rather than derived from a common root. Grammar and syntax are 
a more reliable guide, as well as basic vocabulary, such as pronouns, 
numbers or kinship terms, that's less likely to be borrowed. By systematically comparing these features and looking for regular
patterns of sound changes and correspondences between languages, linguists can determine relationships, trace specific steps in their evolution and even reconstruct earlier languages
with no written records. Linguistics can even reveal 
other important historical clues, such as determining the geographic origins 
and lifestyles of ancient peoples based on which of their words were native, and which were borrowed. There are two main problems linguists face when constructing 
these language family trees. One is that there is 
no clear way of deciding where the branches 
at the bottom should end, that is, which dialects should be considered 
separate languages or vice versa. Chinese is classified as a single language, but its dialects vary to the point
of being mutually unintelligible, while speakers of Spanish and Portuguese can often understand each other. Languages actually spoken by living people do not exist in neatly divided categories, but tend to transition gradually, crossing borders and classifications. Often the difference between
languages and dialects is a matter of changing political 
and national considerations, rather than any linguistic features. This is why the answer to, 
"How many languages are there?" can be anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000, depending on who's counting. The other problem is that 
the farther we move back in time towards the top of the tree, the less evidence we have 
about the languages there. The current division 
of major language families represents the limit at which 
relationships can be established with reasonable certainty, meaning that languages 
of different families are presumed not to be related
on any level. But this may change. While many proposals 
for higher level relationships -- or super families -- are speculative, some have been widely accepted and others are being considered, especially for native languages 
with small speaker populations that have not been extensively studied. We may never be able to determine 
how language came about, or whether all human languages 
did in fact have a common ancestor scattered through the babel of migration. But the next time you hear 
a foreign language, pay attention. It may not be as foreign as you think.

a single language until they suddenly split
into many groups unable to understand each other. We don't really know if 
such an original language ever existed, but we do know that the thousands 
of languages existing today can be traced back 
to a much smaller number. So how did we end up with so many? In the early days of human migration, the world was much less populated. Groups of people that shared
a single language and culture often split into smaller tribes, going separate ways in search 
of fresh game and fertile land. As they migrated and

in this way is called a language family, which can contain 
many branches and sub-families. So how do we determine whether 
languages are related in the first place? Similar sounding words don't tell us much. They could be false cognates 
or just directly borrowed terms rather than derived from a common root. Grammar and syntax are 
a more reliable guide, as well as basic vocabulary, such as pronouns, 
numbers or kinship terms, that's less likely to be borrowed. By systematically comparing these features and looking for regular
patterns of sound changes and correspondences between languages, linguists can determine relationships, trace specific steps in their evolution and even reconstruct earlier languages
with no written records. Linguistics can even reveal 
other important historical clues, such as determining the geographic origins 
and lifestyles of ancient peoples based on which of their words were native, and which were borrowed. There are two main problems linguists face when constructing

the farther we move back in time towards the top of the tree, the less evidence we have 
about the languages there. The current division 
of major language families represents the limit at which 
relationships can be established with reasonable certainty, meaning that languages 
of different families are presumed not to be related
on any level. But this may change. While many proposals 
for higher level relationships -- or super families -- are speculative, some have been widely accepted and others are being considered, especially for native languages 
with small speaker populations that have not been extensively studied. We may never be able to determine 
how language came about, or whether all human languages 
did in fact have a common ancestor scattered through the babel of migration. But the next time you hear

**Transcript**:
I'm a geographer at Middlebury College, and I use digital technologies to reimagine the past. I want to take you to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, July 1, 1863, we're right in the middle of the Civil War. From the northwest, the Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee, and from the southeast, the Union forces under George Meade, converge at this place more or less by chance. They didn't plan to fight here. But the Battle of Gettysburg turns out to be the turning point of the Civil War. Now, Robert E. Lee is probably the most famous American general, widely respected. But at Gettysburg, he made some crucial mistakes, probably the most important was in ordering Pickett's Charge. I'm going to show you how I took a new look at Pickett's Charge with historical maps and GIS. My key map was this extraordinary thing, 12 feet by 13 feet, in the vault of treasures at the National Archives. Here are some of my students at Middlebury to give you a sense of that scale. It was recompiled into a finished map the size of a large poster. You can see the layout of the town of Gettysburg, you see the undulating shape of the terrain. If you look at other details, you can see forests and orchards and streams and roads. I want you to look at those very fine black lines. Those are called contour lines, and they show the elevation at 4-foot intervals, the most detailed elevation I have ever seen. Now, before I explain this image, I need to tell you a little about GIS. It stands for Geographic Information Systems. It's a kind of software that allows you to map almost anything. You can also use it to do terrain analysis. For example, if you're building a ski resort, and you want people to get off the lift and have the most spectacular view possible, you use viewshed analysis that shows you what you can see from a certain point on the terrain. I used that to place myself digitally in the footsteps of Robert E. Lee, to ask, 'What could he see?' and 'What could he not see?' that might have influenced his command decisions. Now, back to these contour lines. This is the best elevation data that I could find. I traced all of the lines, you see in the black and white drawings, some of those lines, stitched them together, gave them elevation values, and then transformed it, within the GIS program, into a continuous terrain. This is a simulation of the ground of the battlefield. Now, I'm ready to place myself in Lee's boots and ask what he could see. The particular moment I want to look at is that battle I mentioned, Pickett's Charge. Lee makes a crucial decision on the morning of the third day, this is July 3rd, 1863, the fighting on the previous two days has been fierce. It's gone back and forth, neither side has a clear advantage. Lee goes down to the bottom of the field, we know this, here's my gorgeous source map again and watch the red circle appear. He goes to the southern end of the battlefield at about 8:00 in the morning with his binoculars and looks through them to figure out where to attack the Union line, where are they most vulnerable. Now, in this next image, I'm going to show you the GIS process called viewshed analysis, along with Lee's line of sight in that sort of reddish cone is the direction we think he was looking. Viewshed analysis, remember, tells me what I can see and what I can't see from a certain point, so in this map, the grey area is what Lee couldn't see. The clear area, where you see that historic map coming through, is what he could've definitely seen. Notice how much of the right side of the map is in grey. Now, we add another crucial piece of information. Someone named John Bachelder, a landscape painter from New Hampshire, went down to the battlefield as soon as he heard about the fight, in order to document where troops had been and to try to paint the battle. He ended up getting $10,000 from Congress in order to document troop positions down to the half hour. He produced 24 maps that we also digitized and brought into the GIS. And this next map shows that troop position information; it's crucial for understanding what Lee could and what he couldn't see. Now, if you look closely at this map, you might be able to see kind of the middle is a black oval around an area that's relatively clear. The blue markings in that black oval are Union troops that I'm definitely sure that Lee could see. But if you look to the right of that, you'll see an awful lot of blue markings. Those are Union troops in the shadows. Now, we know that on the night before Lee's reconnaissance so, the night of July 2nd, he sent out scouts. Of course, he wanted to know where the federal troops were. But quite astonishingly, we have no explanation for this. The scouts came back saying, 'Don't worry, General Lee. We didn't see any troops to the east,' in your map to the right, 'of the Roundtops, some really big hills.' We don't know if they got drunk or fell asleep, but they didn't see almost a third of the Union army. So Lee is blind from his scouts, and from his viewpoint, he's also blind. He decides to attack what he thinks is the weak middle of the Union line, not knowing about where the rest of the troops are. So if you look in the middle of this image, there's a gap in the Union line from where the blue soldiers are at the north of the battlefield and at the south. So let me now play out, using these troop positions, Pickett's Charge. The Confederate soldiers are lined up on the west side of the battlefield, standing under the trees. 18,000 men who first begin to walk and then trot and then run across open farm fields with their rifles leveled at the federal line. Now, the Union army has about 15-20 minutes to organize itself. They see that the Confederates are converging on the middle of their line, and what do they do? The blue arrow here, representing movement of the Union troops, they pull their troops toward that weak center, and let me show you how they were able to concentrate those men in a remarkably short period of time. Lee didn't know that the Union could've done this. You see now, they're standing like a wall, ready to receive the Confederate assault, which happens between 1:30 and about 2:00, 2:30 in the afternoon. There is tremendously fierce fighting, hand-to-hand combat. Now these blue lines, coming in between 2-2:30 in the afternoon, are pulling more reserves, more reinforcements, to that weak center of the Union line. What happens? The Union soliders drive the Confederates off. Lee rides out, among his men, at 3:00 in the afternoon, saying, 'I'm sorry. It's my fault. It's my fault.' This story of sight has been a missing part of the Battle of Gettysburg. Here's their retreat. Historians have not been previously able to figure out what he could and couldn't see. I think it helps explain his decision. Why? Because from his point of view, the federals were very weak. He was attacking at the logical place, but without full knowledge, he set his men out for a dreadful defeat. Now, there's one more piece to this story. Last summer was the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg. And I was able to work with a 3D animator, so we were able to use the GIS information to render the terrain issue as you see it here. And my closing story is about how sight helped the other side. A federal general named GK Warren stood in the spot that this panoramic view is showing you, looking out over the battlefield. And at a key moment on day two, he was able to see on the far horizon Confederate soldiers emerging out of the trees who were about to attack Little Roundtop. He called in reinforcements just in time and saved the day for the Union, setting the stage for the Union almost-victory on day three. So, I hope that all of you who are so gifted with digital technologies will begin to think about how you can use them for history. It can be amazing. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
There's a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the
congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September 8, 2009. On that day, a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials, a group of Afghan government officials, who would be meeting with some local village elders. The column came under ambush, and was surrounded on three sides, and amongst many other things, Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead. One of the people he rescued was a sergeant, and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter. And what was remarkable about this day is, by sheer coincidence, one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera. It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck. They put him in the helicopter, and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more. I saw this, and I thought to myself, where do people like that come from? What is that? That is some deep, deep emotion, when you would want to do that. There's a love there, and I wanted to know why is it that I don't have people that I work with like that? You know, in the military, they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain. In business, we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain. We have it backwards. Right? So I asked myself, where do
people like this come from? And my initial conclusion was
that they're just better people. That's why they're attracted to the military. These better people are attracted to this concept of service. But that's completely wrong. What I learned was that it's the environment, and if you get the environment right, every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things, and more importantly, others have that capacity too. I've had the great honor of getting to meet some of these, who we would call heroes, who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others, and I asked them, "Why would you do it? Why did you do it?" And they all say the same thing: "Because they would have done it for me." It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation. So trust and cooperation are really important here. The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings, they are not instructions. I can't simply say to you, "Trust me," and you will. I can't simply instruct two people 
to cooperate, and they will. It's not how it works. It's a feeling. So where does that feeling come from? If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era, to the early days of Homo sapiens, what we find is that the world was filled with danger, all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us. Nothing personal. Whether it was the weather, lack of resources, maybe a saber-toothed tiger, all of these things working to reduce our lifespan. And so we evolved into social animals, where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe, where we felt like we belonged. And when we felt safe amongst our own, the natural reaction was trust and cooperation. There are inherent benefits to this. It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within
my tribe will watch for danger. If we don't trust each other, if I don't trust you, that means you won't watch for danger. Bad system of survival. The modern day is exactly the same thing. The world is filled with danger, things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success, reduce our opportunity for success. It could be the ups and downs in the economy, the uncertainty of the stock market. It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight. Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you. It's sometimes trying to put you out of business, but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you. We have no control over these forces. These are a constant, and they're not going away. The only variable are the conditions inside the organization, and that's where leadership matters, because it's the leader that sets the tone. When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first, to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results, so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong, remarkable things happen. I was flying on a trip, and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called, and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law, like a criminal. He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon. So I said something. I said, "Why do you have treat us like cattle? Why can't you treat us like human beings?" And this is exactly what she said to me. She said, "Sir, if I don't follow the rules, I could get in trouble or lose my job." All she was telling me is that she doesn't feel safe. All she was telling me is that she doesn't trust her leaders. The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people. It's because they don't fear their leaders. You see, if the conditions are wrong, we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other, and that inherently weakens the organization. When we feel safe inside the organization, we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities. The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is, is like being a parent. If you think about what being a great parent is, what do you want? What makes a great parent? We want to give our child opportunities, education, discipline them when necessary, all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves. Great leaders want exactly the same thing. They want to provide their people opportunity, education, discipline when necessary, build their self-confidence, give
them the opportunity to try and fail, all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves. Charlie Kim, who's the CEO of
a company called Next Jump in New York City, a tech company, he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family, would you ever consider laying
off one of your children? We would never do it. Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization? Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment. If you get a job at Next Jump, you cannot get fired for performance issues. In fact, if you have issues, they will coach you and they will give you support, just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school. It's the complete opposite. This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred, anger, at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate
salaries and bonus structures. It's not the numbers. It's that they have violated the
very definition of leadership. They have violated this deep-seated social contract. We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could
protect their own interests, or worse, they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests. This is what so offends us, not the numbers. Would anybody be offended if we gave a $150 million bonus to Gandhi? How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa? Do we have an issue with that? None at all. None at all. Great leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers. They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Bob Chapman, who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry-Wehmiller, in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession, and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight. Now in a large manufacturing company, this is a big deal, and they could no longer afford their labor pool. They needed to save 10 million dollars, so, like so many companies today, the board got together and discussed layoffs. And Bob refused. You see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts. Bob believes in heart counts, and it's much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count. And so they came up with a furlough program. Every employee, from secretary to CEO, was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation. They could take it any time they wanted, and they did not have to take it consecutively. But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much. He said, it's better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot, and morale went up. They saved 20 million dollars, and most importantly, as would be expected, when the people feel safe and protected
by the leadership in the organization, the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate. And quite spontaneously, nobody expected, people started trading with each other. Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less. People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three. Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank. I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders. They are authorities, and we do what they say because they have authority over us, but we would not follow them. And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders, and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them, and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them. This is what a leader is. I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater, and as is the Marine custom, the officer ate last, and he let his men eat first, and when they were done, there was no food left for him. And when they went back out in the field, his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat, because that's what happens. We call them leaders because they go first. We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does. We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain, and when we do, the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us. They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader's vision comes to life, and when we ask them, "Why would you do that? Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person?" they all say the same thing: "Because they would have done it for me." And isn't that the organization we would all like to work in? Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
For most of history, humans had no idea what purpose the heart served. In fact, the organ so confused Leonardo da Vinci, that he gave up studying it. Although everyone could feel their own heart beating, it wasn't always clear what each thump was achieving. Now we know that the heart pumps blood. But that fact wasn't always obvious, because if a heart was exposed or taken out, the body would perish quickly. It's also impossible to see through the blood vessels, and even if that were possible, the blood itself is opaque, making it difficult to see the heart valves working. Even in the 21st century, only a few people in surgery teams have actually seen a working heart. Internet searches for heart function, point to crude models, diagrams or animations that don't really show how it works. It's as if there has been a centuries old conspiracy amongst teachers and students to accept that heart function cannot be demonstrated. Meaning that the next best thing is simply to cut it open and label the parts. That way students might not fully grasp the way it works, but can superficially understand it, learning such concepts as the heart is a four-chambered organ, or potentially misleading statements like, mammals have a dual-circulation: one with blood going to the lungs and back, and another to the body and back. In reality, mammals have a figure-eight circulation. Blood goes from one heart pump to the lungs, back to the second heart pump, which sends it to the body, and then back to the first pump. That's an important difference because it marks two completely different morphologies. This confusion makes many students wary of the heart in biology lessons, thinking it signals an intimidating subject full of complicated names and diagrams. Only those who end up studying medicine compeltely understand how it all actually works. That's when its functions become apparent as medics get to observe the motion of the heart's valves. So, let's imagine you're a medic for a day. What you'll need to get started is a whole fresh heart, like one from a sheep or pig. Immerse this heart in water and you'll see that it doesn't pump when squeezed by hand. That's because water doesn't enter the heart cleanly enough for the pumping mechanism to work. We can solve this problem in an extraordinarly simple way. Simply identify the two atria and cut them off, trimming them down to the tops of the ventricles. This makes the heart look less complicated because the atria have several incoming veins attached. So without them there, the only vessels remaining are the two major heart arteries: the aorta and pulmonary artery, which rise like white columns from between the ventricles. It looks -- and really is -- very simple. If you run water into the right ventricle from a tap (the left also works, but less spectacularly), you'll see that the ventricular valve tries to close against the incoming stream. And then ventricle inflates with water. Squeeze the ventricle and a stream of water squirts out of the pulmonary artery. The ventricular valves, called the tricuspid in the right ventricle and the mitral in the left, can be seen through the clear water opening and closing like parachutes as the ventricle is rhythmically squeezed. This flow of water mimics the flow of blood in life. The valves are completely efficient. You'll notice they don't leak at all when the ventricles are squeezed. Over time, they also close against each other with very little wear and tear, which explains how this mechanism continues to work seamlessly for more than 2 billion beats a heart gives in its lifetime. Now, anyone studying the heart can hold one in their hands, make it pump for real and watch the action unfold. So place your hand above your own and feel its rhymic beat. Understanding how this dependable inner pump works gives new resonance to the feeling you get when you run a race, drink too much caffeine or catch the eye of the one you love.

**Transcript**:
This is The Notorious B.I.G., 1995, the Palladium nightclub, New York City. What really I want to talk about is my dedication, my 100% focus, and finding something that I love, my passion point. I fought to be on this stage, to be able to stand next to Lil' Kim and take all these pictures to create one definitive photo. A photo that was the most important of anything that I took. And I really wanted it for future generations to be able to feel the energy that was in that room, and certaintly you can feel that right there. I'm a photographer, this is what I do for a living. I chase these moments, these fractions of seconds, that will never be the same again. You can't take this picture again because I took it, and he's no longer with us, sadly, rest in peace. The definitive portrait of that person, in that moment, is what I strive for every single time out, like when you close your eyes and think of a picture of Jay-Z, I want it to be my picture. So far, so good. Eight album covers for Jay-Z later, I'm not doing too bad. Aaliyah. Gorgeous and amazing, and I really spent proper time with her, conversing, having a conversation, connecting to her, which I find is a big part of my work. That connection, to be able to have a conversation, to say you're doing great, to say why I want a certain picture and a certain attitude. In this moment, we talked about shooting in the Caribbean, and it's sort of a passion point for me, Caribbean culture, Trinidad, Barbados, Jamaica, and I said, "We should do a photo shoot there because I think it would be incredible." And she said, "Yeah, you know, let's do it." You know, as we're taking these beautiful pictures, all this is happening, I'm continuing to converse with her and really connect. So, she believed in my vision at that moment, you know, even while all the work was happening there was a human connection that happened. At the end of the day, I have people sign Polaroids just as kind of a diary for myself. And she wrote, "I can't wait for the Caribbean. I'll see you then." (Exhales) You've got to take a breath. You've got to take a breath. She's missed incredibly. And I think what the reminder is that these moments are really precious, and you really have to take the time to connect to them, to be part of that process, to make a difference in people's lives in that moment. You never know how you're affected by somebody, clearly I am, you can see it, but you never know how you affect that person, how you make that moment a little more important for them. This is my good friend Drake. I had the opportunity to work with him for the FADER magazine. He is a beast and one of my favorites. He's my friend. I shot him for three different days, two in New York, and he had just signed his record deal. He said, "What's most important to me is going home to Toronto to celebrate with my family." So, we went home. We flew home. And he said, "I've got to do a pit stop. I've got to go see my grandmother in the afternoon, and so you probably don't want to bother with that." I said, "It would be an honor to meet your grandmother." I asked for what I wanted. I asked for access that nobody else had because this is what makes a photographer sort of greater, to have a picture that somebody else doesn't have. We want these unique moments. I asked for these moments, right? And I'm reminded of a story. He said, "Grandma, I just got millions of dollars. I just signed a record deal. I've got millions of dollars from Cash Money Universal and Young Money." And she said, "A million dollars?" He said, "No Grandma, millions of dollars. What do you want?" And she said, "I want a kiss, and I want a hug." Again, the reminder of, like, why we do this. It also revealed for me another layer of Drake as a character, and how important this guy is, you know, his message. He's not just about the limelight and self-serving. He's connected to these moments as much as I was connected to this moment as a photographer. I know everybody does this everyday, they ask DMX to get in a pool of blood. This was my challenge this day. I needed to get him to see my vision. I was very clear in what I wanted for "Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood," which was his album cover. You know, I envisioned photographs of him in this pool of blood, just making these things happen, you know? And what was difficult was he didn't see it the same way I saw it, right? He walked in, and he had these pants on. Brand new pants. Everybody feels fresh when they have brand new pants on, right? He said, "I'm not getting in that pool of blood." I said, "Oh yes, you're going to get in that pool of blood." You know? And he said, "No, my dogs, I'm not getting in that pool of blood." And I said, "My dude, you're going to get in that pool of blood." And in a bold statement, using all the psychology knowledge that I had from my schooling at Kenyon College, I dropped my pants in front of 40 people on a set that all were, like, stunned. DMX laughed. He said, "Alright, my dude, put your pants back on, and I'll get in the blood." One of the most epic photos that we've ever created in this hip-hop movement. I'm on home soil. I'm in New Orleans. We've got to give love to Lil Wayne. Lil Wayne is an incredible MC, and the biggest point that I want to drive home here is about the opportunity to create somebody's legacy with them, to take pictures, to see them grow. It was about trust in the moment and understanding that you could make a difference, have a communication, see somebody elevate and move forward, to take a variety of different pictures, you know? Him in a spacesuit. He's a Martian, you know, what can I say, you know? But it was about seeing his growth, and having an important role and communication with this guy in the moment. DJ Quick once said, "Isn't it incredible how you make people see your vision in hip-hop? The way that people look at hip-hop is through your eyes." I'm really, really proud of what I've created, what I've done, and passionately working to make quality work constantly. It's not about taking a photo. For me, it's about giving a photo to people that believe in it so much. Thank you.

Transcriber: Jessica Ruby
Reviewer: Caroline Cristal Russia, with the largest territory in the world, has roughly the same total population as Nigeria, a country 1/16 its size. But this similarity won't last long. One of the populations is rapidly growing, while the other is slowly declining. What can this tell us about the two countries? Population statistics are some of the most important data social scientists and policy experts have to work with. But understanding a country's situation and making accurate predictions requires knowing not just the total size of the population but its internal characteristics, such as age and gender distribution. So, how can we keep track of all that data in a way that makes it easy to comprehend? Complex data is more easily interpreted through visualization, and one of the ways that demographers represent the internal distribution of a population is the population pyramid. Here, the data is divided by gender with females on one side and males on the other. The population numbers are shown for each five-year age interval, starting from 0-4 and continuing up to 100 and up. These intervals are grouped together into pre-reproductive (0-14), reproductive (15-44), and post-reproductive years (45 and up). Such a population pyramid can be a powerful predictor of future population trends. For example, Rwanda's population pyramid shows it to be a fast-growing country, with most of the population being in the youngest age groups at the bottom of the pyramid. The number will grow rapidly in the coming years. As today's children reach their reproductive years and have children of their own, the total population is almost certain to double within the next few decades. For our second example, let's look at Canada, where most of the population is clustered around the middle of the graph. Because there are less people in the pre-reproductive age groups than there are in the reproductive ones, the population will grow more slowly, as the number of people reaching their reproductive years decreases. Finally, let's look at Japan. Because the majority of its population is in its post-reproductive years and the number of people is smaller at each younger interval, this means that at current rates of reproduction the population will begin to decline as fewer and fewer people reach reproductive age. Comparing these three population pyramids side by side shows us three different stages in a demographic transition, as a country moves from a pre-industrial society to one with an industrial or post-industrial economy. Countries that have only recently begun the process of industrialization typically see an increase in life expectancy and a fall in child mortality rates as a result of improvements in medicine, sanitation, and food supply. While birth rates remain constant, leading to a population boom. Developing countries that are farther along in the industrialization process begin to see a fall in birth rates, due to factors such as increased education and opportunities for women outside of child-rearing and a move from rural to urban living that makes having large families less economically advantageous. Finally, countries in advanced stages of industrialization reach a point where both birth and death rates are low, and the population remains stable or even begins to decline. Now, let's take a look at the projected population pyramids for the same three countries in 2050. What do these tell us about the expected changes in each country's population, and what kinds of factors can alter the shape of these future pyramids? A population pyramid can be useful not only as a predictor of a country's future but as a record of its past. Russia's population pyramid still bears the scars of World War II, which explains both the fewer numbers of elderly men compared to elderly women and the relatively sudden population increase as soldiers returned from the war and normal life resumed. China's population pyramid reflects the establishment of the one child policy 35 years before, which prevented a population boom such as that of Rwanda but also led to sex-selective abortions, resulting in more male children than female children. Finally, the pyramid for the United States shows the baby boom that followed World War II. As you can see, population pyramids tell us far more about a country than just a set of numbers, by showing both where it's been and where it's headed within a single image. And in today's increasingly interconnected world, facing issues such as food shortages, ecological threats, and economic disparities, it is increasingly important for both scientists and policy makers to have a rich and complex understanding of populations and the factors affecting them.

Here, the data is divided by gender with females on one side and males on the other. The population numbers are shown for each five-year age interval, starting from 0-4 and continuing up to 100 and up. These intervals are grouped together into pre-reproductive (0-14), reproductive (15-44), and post-reproductive years (45 and up). Such a population pyramid can be a powerful predictor of future population trends. For example, Rwanda's population pyramid shows it to be a fast-growing country, with most of the population being in the youngest age groups at the bottom of the pyramid. The number will grow rapidly in the coming years. As today's children reach their reproductive years and have children of their own, the total population is almost certain to double within the next few decades. For our second example, let's look at Canada, where most of the population is clustered around the middle of the graph. Because there are less people in the pre-reproductive age groups than there are in the reproductive ones, the population will grow more slowly, as the number of people reaching their reproductive years decreases. Finally, let's look at Japan. Because the majority of its population is in its post-reproductive years and the number of people is smaller at each younger interval, this means that at current rates of reproduction the population will begin to decline as fewer and fewer people reach reproductive age. Comparing these three population pyramids side by side shows us three different stages in a demographic transition, as a country moves from a pre-industrial society to one with an industrial or post-industrial economy. Countries that have only recently begun the process of industrialization typically see an increase in life expectancy and a fall in child mortality rates as a result of improvements in medicine, sanitation, and food supply. While birth rates remain constant, leading to a population boom. Developing countries that are farther along in the industrialization process begin to see a fall in birth rates, due to factors such as increased education and opportunities for women outside of child-rearing and a move from rural to urban living that makes having large families less economically advantageous. Finally, countries in advanced stages of industrialization reach a point where both birth and death rates are low, and the population remains stable or even begins to decline. Now, let's take a look at the projected population pyramids for the same three countries in 2050. What do these tell us about the expected changes in each country's population, and what kinds of factors can alter the shape of these future pyramids? A population pyramid can be useful not only as a predictor of a country's future but as a record of its past. Russia's population pyramid still bears the scars of World War II, which explains both the fewer numbers of elderly men compared to elderly women and the relatively sudden population increase as soldiers returned from the war and normal life resumed. China's population pyramid reflects the establishment of the one child policy 35 years before, which prevented a population boom such as that of Rwanda but also led to sex-selective abortions, resulting in more male children than female children. Finally, the pyramid for the United States shows the baby boom that followed World War II. As you can see, population pyramids tell us far more about a country than just a set of numbers, by showing both where it's been and where it's headed within a single image. And in today's increasingly interconnected world, facing issues such as food shortages, ecological threats, and economic disparities, it is increasingly important for both scientists and policy makers to have a rich and complex understanding of populations and the factors affecting them.

Reviewer: Caroline Cristal Russia, with the largest territory in the world, has roughly the same total population as Nigeria, a country 1/16 its size. But this similarity won't last long.

Population statistics are some of the most important data social scientists and policy experts have to work with.

**Transcript**:
It really makes a difference what we say. I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz. She went to Auschwitz when she was fifteen years old, and her brother was eight, and the parents were lost. And she told me this, "We were in the train going to Auschwitz, and I looked down, and I saw 
my brother's shoes were missing. And I said, 'Why are you so stupid? Can't you keep your things together? For goodness sake!' The way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother." Unfortunately, it was the last thing she ever said to him because she never saw him again. He did not survive. And so when she came out of Auschwitz, she made a vow. She said, "I walked out of Auschwitz into life. And the vow was, "I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever say." Now, can we do that? No. But it is a possibility to live in to. Thank you.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the vow that the sister made when she walked out of Auschwitz?
Options: A. I will act with gratitude towards every situation that life affords me, B. In every way I possibly can, I will make my life an example of how good always conquers evil, C. I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever say, D. Revenge is futile, rebirth is inevitable, life is precious, kindness is obligatory
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What connection is there between the woman's experience in Auschwitz and her vow?

**Transcript**:
To understand climate change, think of the game "Tetris." For eons, Earth has played a version of this game with blocks of carbon. They enter the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas from volcanoes, decaying plant matter, breathing creatures and the surface of the sea. And they leave the atmosphere when they're used by plants during photosynthesis, absorbed back into the ocean, or stored in soil and sediment. This game of Tetris is called the carbon cycle, and it's the engine of life on Earth. What's the connection to climate? Well, when that carbon dioxide is in the air, waiting to be reabsorbed, it traps a portion of the sun's heat, which would otherwise escape to space. That's why carbon dioxide is called a greenhouse gas. It creates a blanket of warmth, known as the greenhouse effect, that keeps our Earth from freezing like Mars. The more carbon dioxide blocks hang out in the atmosphere waiting to be cleared, the warmer Earth becomes. Though the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has varied through ice ages and astroid impacts, over the past 8,000 years the stable climate we know took shape, allowing human civilization to thrive. But about 200 years ago, we began digging up that old carbon that had been stored in the soil. These fossil fuels, coal, oil and natural gas are made from the buried remains of plants and animals that died long before humans evolved. The energy stored inside them was able to power our factories, cars and power plants. But burning these fuels also injected new carbon blocks into Earth's Tetris game. At the same time, we cleared forests for agriculture, reducing the Earth's ability to remove the blocks. And since 1750, the amount of carbon in the atmosophere has increased by 40%, and shows no sign of slowing. Just like in Tetris, the more blocks pile up, the harder it becomes to restore stability. The extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere accelerates the greenhouse effect by trapping more heat near the surface and causing polar ice caps to melt. And the more they melt, the less sunlight they're able to reflect, making the oceans warm even faster. Sea levels rise, coastal populations are threatened with flooding, natural ecosystems are disrupted, and the weather becomes more extreme over time. Climate change may effect different people and places in different ways. But, ultimately, it's a game that we're all stuck playing. And unlike in Tetris, we won't get a chance to start over and try again.

**Transcript**:
You're in line at the grocery store when, uh oh, someone sneezes on you. The cold virus is sucked inside your lungs and lands on a cell on your airway lining. Every living thing on Earth is made of cells, from the smallest one-celled bacteria to the giant blue whale to you. Each cell in your body is surrounded by a cell membrane, a thick flexible layer made of fats and proteins, that surrounds and protects the inner components. It's semipermeable, meaning that it lets some thing pass in and out but blocks others. The cell membrane is covered with tiny projections. They all have functions, like helping cells adhere to their neighbors or binding to nutrients the cell will need. Animal and plant cells have cell membranes. Only plant cells have a cell wall, which is made of rigid cellulose that gives the plant structure. The virus cell that was sneezed into your lungs is sneaky. Pretending to be a friend, it attaches to a projection on the cell membrane, and the cell brings it through the cell membrane and inside. When the virus gets through, the cell recognizes its mistake. An enemy is inside! Special enzymes arrive at the scene and chop the virus to pieces. They then send one of the pieces back through the cell membrane, where the cell displays it to warn neighboring cells about the invader. A nearby cell sees the warning and immediately goes into action. It needs to make antibodies, proteins that will attack and kill the invading virus. This process starts in the nucleus. The nucleus contains our DNA, the blueprint that tells our cells how to make everything our bodies need to function. A certain section of our DNA contains instructions that tell our cells how to make antibodies. Enzymes in the nucleus find the right section of DNA, then create a copy of these instructions, called messenger RNA. The messenger RNA leaves the nucleus to carry out its orders. The messenger RNA travels to a ribosome. There can be as many as 10 million ribosomes in a human cell, all studded along a ribbon-like structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. This ribosome reads the instructions from the nucleus. It takes amino acids and links them together one by one creating an antibody protein that will go fight the virus. But before it can do that, the antibody needs to leave the cell. The antibody heads to the golgi apparatus. Here, it's packed up for delivery outside the cell. Enclosed in a bubble made of the same material as the cell membrane, the golgi apparatus also gives the antibody directions, telling it how to get to the edge of the cell. When it gets there, the bubble surrounding the antibody fuses to the cell membrane. The cell ejects the antibody, and it heads out to track down the virus. The leftover bubble will be broken down by the cell's lysosomes and its pieces recycled over and over again. Where did the cell get the energy to do all this? That's the roll of the mitochondria. To make energy, the mitochondria takes oxygen, this is the only reason we breathe it, and adds electrons from the food we eat to make water molecules. That process also creates a high energy molecule, called ATP which the cell uses to power all of its parts. Plant cells make energy a different way. They have chloroplasts that combine carbon dioxide and water with light energy from the sun to create oxygen and sugar, a form of chemical energy. All the parts of a cell have to work together to keep things running smoothly, and all the cells of your body have to work together to keep you running smoothly. That's a whole lot of cells. Scientists think there are about 37 trillion of them.

**Transcript**:
You're in line at the grocery store when, uh oh, someone sneezes on you. The cold virus is sucked inside your lungs and lands on a cell on your airway lining. Every living thing on Earth is made of cells, from the smallest one-celled bacteria to the giant blue whale to you. Each cell in your body is surrounded by a cell membrane, a thick flexible layer made of fats and proteins, that surrounds and protects the inner components. It's semipermeable, meaning that it lets some thing pass in and out but blocks others. The cell membrane is covered with tiny projections.

**Transcript**:
He was one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, forever changing the course of one of the world's largest countries. But was he a hero who toppled an oppressive tyranny or a villain who replaced it with another? It's time to put Lenin on the stand in History vs. Lenin. "Order, order, hmm. Now, wasn't it your fault that the band broke up?" "Your honor, this is Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, AKA Lenin, the rabblerouser who helped overthrow 
the Russian tsar Nicholas II in 1917 and founded the Soviet Union, one of the worst dictatorships of the 20th century." "Ohh." "The tsar was a bloody tyrant under whom the masses toiled in slavery." "This is rubbish. Serfdom had already been abolished in 1861." "And replaced by something worse. The factory bosses treated the people far worse than their former feudal landlords. And unlike the landlords, they were always there. Russian workers toiled for eleven hours a day and were the lowest paid in all of Europe." "But Tsar Nicholas made laws to protect the workers." "He reluctantly did the bare minimum to avert revolution, and even there, he failed. Remember what happened in 1905 after his troops fired on peaceful petitioners?" "Yes, and the tsar ended the rebellion by introducing a constitution and an elected parliament, the Duma." "While retaining absolute power and dissolving them whenever he wanted." "Perhaps there would've been more reforms in due time if radicals, like Lenin, weren't always stirring up trouble." "Your Honor, Lenin had seen his older brother Aleksandr executed by the previous tsar for revolutionary activity, and even after the reforms, Nicholas continued the same mass repression and executions, as well as the unpopular involvement in World War I, that cost Russia so many lives and resources." "Hm, this tsar doesn't sound like such a capital fellow." "Your Honor, maybe Nicholas II did doom himself with bad decisions, but Lenin deserves no credit for this. When the February 1917 uprisings finally forced the tsar to abdicate, Lenin was still exiled in Switzerland." "Hm, so who came to power?" "The Duma formed a provisional government, led by Alexander Kerensky, an incompetent bourgeois failure. He even launched another failed offensive in the war, where Russia had already lost so much, instead of ending it like the people wanted." "It was a constitutional social democratic government, the most progressive of its time. And it could have succeeded eventually if Lenin hadn't returned in April, sent by the Germans to undermine the Russian war effort and instigate riots." "Such slander! The July Days were a spontaneous and justified reaction against the government's failures. And Kerensky showed his true colors when he blamed Lenin and arrested and outlawed his Bolshevik party, forcing him to flee into exile again. Some democracy! It's a good thing the government collapsed under their own incompetence and greed when they tried to stage a military coup then had to ask the Bolsheviks for help when it backfired. After that, all Lenin had to do was return in October and take charge. The government was peacefully overthrown overnight." "But what the Bolsheviks did after gaining power wasn't very peaceful. How many people did they execute without trial? And was it really necessary to murder the tsar's entire family, even the children?" "Russia was being attacked by foreign imperialists, trying to restore the tsar. Any royal heir that was rescued would be recognized as ruler by foreign governments. It would've been the end of everything the people had fought so hard to achieve. Besides, Lenin may not have given the order." "But it was not only imperialists that the Bolsheviks killed. What about the purges and executions of other socialist and anarchist parties, their old allies? What about the Tambov Rebellion, where peasants, resisting grain confiscation, were killed with poison gas? Or sending the army to crush the workers in Kronstadt, who were demanding democratic self-management? Was this still fighting for the people?" "Yes! The measures were difficult, but it was a difficult time. The new government needed to secure itself while being attacked from all sides, so that the socialist order could be established." "And what good came of this socialist order? Even after the civil war was won, there were famines, repression and millions executed or sent to die in camps, while Lenin's successor Stalin established a cult of personality and absolute power." "That wasn't the plan. Lenin never cared for personal gains, even his enemies admitted that he fully believed in his cause, living modestly and working tirelessly from his student days until his too early death. He saw how power-hungry Stalin was and tried to warn the party, but it was too late." "And the decades of totalitarianism that followed after?" "You could call it that, but it was Lenin's efforts that changed Russia in a few decades from a backward and undeveloped monarchy full of illiterate peasants to a modern, industrial superpower, with one of the world's best educated populations, unprecedented opportunities for women, and some of the most important scientific advancements of the century. Life may not have been luxurious, but nearly everyone had a roof over their head and food on their plate, which few countries have achieved." "But these advances could still have happened, even without Lenin and the repressive regime he established." "Yes, and I could've been a famous rock and roll singer. But how would I have sounded?" We can never be sure how things could've unfolded if different people were in power or different decisions were made, but to avoid the mistakes of the past, we must always be willing to put historical figures on trial.

**Transcript**:
He was one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, forever changing the course of one of the world's largest countries. But was he a hero who toppled an oppressive tyranny or a villain who replaced it with another? It's time to put Lenin on the stand in History vs. Lenin. "Order, order, hmm. Now, wasn't it your fault that the band broke up?" "Your honor, this is Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, AKA Lenin, the rabblerouser who helped overthrow 
the Russian tsar Nicholas II in 1917 and founded the Soviet Union, one of the worst dictatorships of the 20th century." "Ohh." "The tsar was a bloody tyrant under whom the masses toiled in slavery." "This is rubbish. Serfdom had already been abolished in 1861." "And replaced by something worse. The factory bosses treated the people far worse than their former feudal landlords. And unlike the landlords, they were always there. Russian workers toiled for eleven hours a day and were the lowest paid in all of Europe." "But Tsar Nicholas made laws to protect the workers." "He reluctantly did the bare minimum to avert revolution, and even there, he failed. Remember what happened in 1905 after his troops fired on peaceful petitioners?" "Yes, and the tsar ended the rebellion by introducing a constitution and an elected parliament, the Duma." "While retaining absolute power and dissolving them whenever he wanted." "Perhaps there would've been more reforms in due time if radicals, like Lenin, weren't always stirring up trouble." "Your Honor, Lenin had seen his older brother Aleksandr executed by the previous tsar for revolutionary activity, and even after the reforms, Nicholas continued the same mass repression and executions, as well as the unpopular involvement in World War I, that cost Russia so many lives and resources." "Hm, this tsar doesn't sound like such a capital fellow." "Your Honor, maybe Nicholas II did doom himself with bad decisions, but Lenin deserves no credit for this. When the February 1917 uprisings finally forced the tsar to abdicate, Lenin was still exiled in Switzerland." "Hm, so who came to power?" "The Duma formed a provisional government, led by Alexander Kerensky, an incompetent bourgeois failure. He even launched another failed offensive in the war, where Russia had already lost so much, instead of ending it like the people wanted." "It was a constitutional social democratic government, the most progressive of its time. And it could have succeeded eventually if Lenin hadn't returned in April, sent by the Germans to undermine the Russian war effort and instigate riots." "Such slander! The July Days were a spontaneous and justified reaction against the government's failures. And Kerensky showed his true colors when he blamed Lenin and arrested and outlawed his Bolshevik party, forcing him to flee into exile again. Some democracy! It's a good thing the government collapsed under their own incompetence and greed when they tried to stage a military coup then had to ask the Bolsheviks for help when it backfired. After that, all Lenin had to do was return in October and take charge. The government was peacefully overthrown overnight." "But what the Bolsheviks did after gaining power wasn't very peaceful. How many people did they execute without trial? And was it really necessary to murder the tsar's entire family, even the children?" "Russia was being attacked by foreign imperialists, trying to restore the tsar. Any royal heir that was rescued would be recognized as ruler by foreign governments. It would've been the end of everything the people had fought so hard to achieve. Besides, Lenin may not have given the order." "But it was not only imperialists that the Bolsheviks killed. What about the purges and executions of other socialist and anarchist parties, their old allies? What about the Tambov Rebellion, where peasants, resisting grain confiscation, were killed with poison gas? Or sending the army to crush the workers in Kronstadt, who were demanding democratic self-management? Was this still fighting for the people?" "Yes! The measures were difficult, but it was a difficult time. The new government needed to secure itself while being attacked from all sides, so that the socialist order could be established." "And what good came of this socialist order? Even after the civil war was won, there were famines, repression and millions executed or sent to die in camps, while Lenin's successor Stalin established a cult of personality and absolute power." "That wasn't the plan. Lenin never cared for personal gains, even his enemies admitted that he fully believed in his cause, living modestly and working tirelessly from his student days until his too early death. He saw how power-hungry Stalin was and tried to warn the party, but it was too late." "And the decades of totalitarianism that followed after?" "You could call it that, but it was Lenin's efforts that changed Russia in a few decades from a backward and undeveloped monarchy full of illiterate peasants to a modern, industrial superpower, with one of the world's best educated populations, unprecedented opportunities for women, and some of the most important scientific advancements of the century. Life may not have been luxurious, but nearly everyone had a roof over their head and food on their plate, which few countries have achieved." "But these advances could still have happened, even without Lenin and the repressive regime he established." "Yes, and I could've been a famous rock and roll singer. But how would I have sounded?" We can never be sure how things could've unfolded if different people were in power or different decisions were made, but to avoid the mistakes of the past, we must always be willing to put historical figures on trial.

**Transcript**:
Every four seconds, someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. It's the most common cause of dementia, affecting over 40 million people worldwide, and yet finding a cure is something that still eludes researchers today. Dr. Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist, first described the symptoms in 1901 when he noticed that a particular hospital patient had some peculiar problems, including difficulty sleeping, disturbed memory, drastic mood changes, and increasing confusion. When the patient passed away, Alzheimer was able to do an autopsy and test his idea that perhaps her symptoms were caused by irregularities in the brain's structure. What he found beneath the microscope were visible differences in brain tissue in the form of misfolded proteins called plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. Those plaques and tangles work together to break down the brain's structure. Plaques arise when another protein in the fatty membrane surrounding nerve cells gets sliced up by a particular enzyme, resulting in beta-amyloid proteins, which are sticky and have a tendency to clump together. That clumping is what forms the things we know as plaques. These clumps block signaling and, therefore, communication between cells, and also seem to trigger immune reactions that cause the destruction of disabled nerve cells. In Alzheimer's disease, neurofibrillary tangles are built from a protein known as tau. The brain's nerve cells contain a network of tubes that act like a highway for food molecules among other things. Usually, the tau protein ensures that these tubes are straight, allowing molecules to pass through freely. But in Alzheimer's disease, the protein collapses into twisted strands or tangles, making the tubes disintegrate, obstructing nutrients from reaching the nerve cell and leading to cell death. The destructive pairing of plaques and tangles starts in a region called the hippocampus, which is responsible for forming memories. That's why short-term memory loss is usually the first symptom of Alzheimer's. The proteins then progressively invade other parts of the brain, creating unique changes that signal various stages of the disease. At the front of the brain, the proteins destroy the ability to process logical thoughts. Next, they shift to the region that controls emotions, resulting in erratic mood changes. At the top of the brain, they cause paranoia and hallucinations, and once they reach the brain's rear, the plaques and tangles work together to erase the mind's deepest memories. Eventually the control centers governing heart rate and breathing are overpowered as well resulting in death. The immensely destructive nature of this disease has inspired many researchers to look for a cure but currently they're focused on slowing its progression. One temporary treatment helps reduce the break down of acetylcholine, an important chemical messenger in the brain which is decreased in Alzheimer's patients due to the death of the nerve cells that make it. Another possible solution is a vaccine that trains the body's immune system to attack beta-amyloid plaques before they can form clumps. But we still need to find an actual cure. Alzheimer's disease was discovered more than a century ago, and yet still it is not well understood. Perhaps one day we'll grasp the exact mechanisms at work behind this threat and a solution will be unearthed.

The destructive pairing of plaques and tangles starts in a region called the hippocampus, which is responsible for forming memories. That's why short-term memory loss is usually the first symptom of Alzheimer's. The proteins then progressively invade other parts of the brain, creating unique changes that signal various stages of the disease. At the front of the brain, the proteins destroy the ability to process logical thoughts. Next, they shift to the region that controls emotions, resulting in erratic mood changes. At the top of the brain, they cause paranoia and hallucinations, and once they reach the brain's rear, the plaques and tangles work together to erase the mind's deepest memories. Eventually the control centers governing heart rate and breathing are overpowered as well resulting in death. The immensely destructive nature of this disease has inspired many researchers to look for a cure but currently they're focused on slowing its progression. One temporary treatment helps reduce the break down of acetylcholine, an important chemical messenger in the brain which is decreased in Alzheimer's patients due to the death of the nerve cells that make it. Another possible solution is a vaccine that trains the body's immune system to attack beta-amyloid plaques before they can form clumps. But we still need to find an actual cure. Alzheimer's disease was discovered more than a century ago, and yet still it is not well understood. Perhaps one day we'll grasp the exact mechanisms at work behind this threat and a solution will be unearthed.

**Transcript**:
Every four seconds, someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. It's the most common cause of dementia, affecting over 40 million people worldwide, and yet finding a cure is something that still eludes researchers today. Dr. Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist, first described the symptoms in 1901 when he noticed that a particular hospital patient had some peculiar problems, including difficulty sleeping, disturbed memory, drastic mood changes, and increasing confusion. When the patient passed away, Alzheimer was able to do an autopsy and test his idea that perhaps her symptoms were caused by irregularities in the brain's structure. What he found beneath the microscope were visible differences in brain tissue in the form of misfolded proteins called plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. Those plaques and tangles work together to break down the brain's structure. Plaques arise when another protein in the fatty membrane surrounding nerve cells gets sliced up by a particular enzyme, resulting in beta-amyloid proteins, which are sticky and have a tendency to clump together. That clumping is what forms the things we know as plaques. These clumps block signaling and, therefore, communication between cells, and also seem to trigger immune reactions that cause the destruction of disabled nerve cells. In Alzheimer's disease, neurofibrillary tangles are built from a protein known as tau. The brain's nerve cells contain a network of tubes that act like a highway for food molecules among other things. Usually, the tau protein ensures that these tubes are straight, allowing molecules to pass through freely. But in Alzheimer's disease, the protein collapses into twisted strands or tangles, making the tubes disintegrate, obstructing nutrients from reaching the nerve cell and leading to cell death. The destructive pairing of plaques and tangles starts in a region called the hippocampus, which is responsible for forming memories. That's why short-term memory loss is usually the first symptom of Alzheimer's.

**Transcript**:
Sugar is playing hide and seek with you. You'd think it would be pretty easy for you to win, considering all the sugar in sodas, ice cream, candy, and big white bags labeled sugar. People get about half of their added sugars from those drinks and treats, so it might seem like sugar is hiding in plain sight, but like someone in the witness protection program, the other half is hidden in places you'd least suspect. Check the ingredients on ketchup, bologna, spaghetti sauce, soy milk, sports drinks, fish sticks, and peanut butter. You'll find sugar hiding in most of those products. In fact, you'll find added sugars in three-quarters of the more than 600,000 items available in grocery stores. But how is sugar hiding? Can't you just look on food labels? It's not that easy. Just like your friend Robert might go by Bob, Robby, Rob, Bobby, or Roberto, added sugar has a lot of aliases. And by a lot, we don't mean five or six, try fifty-six. There's brown rice syrup, barley malt, demerara, Florida Crystals, muscovado, and, of course, high fructose corn syrup, sometimes called HFCS, or corn sugar. Even sugar's tricky nicknames have nicknames. Grape or apple concentrate has the same effects on your body as its 55 sugary twins. And even though organic evaporated cane juice sounds healthy, when you evaporate it, you get sugar! Chemically speaking, it's all the same. And even trickier, when multiple added types of sugars are used in one type of product, they get buried down in a long list of ingredients, so the sugar content might appear to be okay, but when you add them all together, sugar can be the single biggest ingredient. Currently, the FDA doesn't suggest a recommended daily limit for sugar, so it's hard to tell if this 65 grams in a bottle of soda is a little or a lot. But the World Health Organization recommends limiting sugar to just 5% of your total calories, or about 25 grams per day. So, 65 grams is well over twice that amount. But just what is sugar? What's the difference between glucose and fructose? Well, both are carbohydrates with the same chemical composition of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But they have very different structures and behave quite differently in our bodies. Glucose is the best source of energy for nearly all organisms on Earth. It can be metabolized by all organs in the body. Fructose, on the other hand, is metabolized primarily in the liver, and when your liver gets overloaded with sweet, sweet fructose, the excess is metabolized to fat. Fresh fruits actually contain fructose, but it's naturally occurring and doesn't cause an overload because the fiber in fruit slows its absorption. This gives your liver the time it needs to do its job. It's sugar that makes cookies chewy and candy crunchy. It even turns bread crust a beautiful, golden brown. It's also a great preservative; it doesn't spoil or evaporate, so the foods it's added to are easier to store and ship long distances and tend to be cheaper. That's why sugar is hiding everywhere. Actually, it might be easier to list the foods that added sugar isn't hiding in, things like: vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, fruit, raw nuts, even your kitchen sink. Simply choosing water over soda, juices, and sports drinks is a great way to avoid hidden added sugar. At the very least, try to pay attention to food labels, so you can keep your sugar intake at a healthy level. Because in this game of hide and seek, every time you don't find added sugar, you win!

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Which is not a reason that the food industry uses to add sugar to food?
Options: A. Sugar browns the food, B. Sugar is a preservative, C. Sugar has fewer calories than fat, D. Sugar changes the texture
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Why can food labels be misleading when it comes to added sugars?
Options: A. Because added sugars are always listed first, B. Since added sugars are only found in obvious sources, C. As added sugars may be listed under different names or buried in a long list of ingredients, D. Due to the font size used on the label
Correct Option: C

And even trickier, when multiple added types of sugars are used in one type of product, they get buried down in a long list of ingredients, so the sugar content might appear to be okay, but when you add them all together, sugar can be the single biggest ingredient. Currently, the FDA doesn't suggest a recommended daily limit for sugar, so it's hard to tell if this 65 grams in a bottle of soda is a little or a lot. But the World Health Organization recommends limiting sugar to just 5% of your total calories, or about 25 grams per day. So, 65 grams is well over twice that amount. But just what is sugar? What's the difference between glucose and fructose? Well, both are carbohydrates with the same chemical composition of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But they have very different structures and behave quite differently in our bodies. Glucose is the best source of energy for nearly all organisms on Earth. It can be metabolized by all organs in the body. Fructose, on the other hand, is metabolized primarily in the liver, and when your liver gets overloaded with sweet, sweet fructose, the excess is metabolized to fat. Fresh fruits actually contain fructose, but it's naturally occurring and doesn't cause an overload because the fiber in fruit slows its absorption. This gives your liver the time it needs to do its job. It's sugar that makes cookies chewy and candy crunchy. It even turns bread crust a beautiful, golden brown. It's also a great preservative; it doesn't spoil or evaporate, so the foods it's added to are easier to store and ship long distances and tend to be cheaper. That's why sugar is hiding everywhere. Actually, it might be easier to list the foods that added sugar isn't hiding in, things like: vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, fruit, raw nuts, even your kitchen sink. Simply choosing water over soda, juices, and sports drinks is a great way to avoid hidden added sugar. At the very least, try to pay attention to food labels, so you can keep your sugar intake at a healthy level. Because in this game of hide and seek, every time you don't find added sugar, you win!

**Transcript**:
Sugar is playing hide and seek with you. You'd think it would be pretty easy for you to win, considering all the sugar in sodas, ice cream, candy, and big white bags labeled sugar. People get about half of their added sugars from those drinks and treats, so it might seem like sugar is hiding in plain sight, but like someone in the witness protection program, the other half is hidden in places you'd least suspect. Check the ingredients on ketchup, bologna, spaghetti sauce, soy milk, sports drinks, fish sticks, and peanut butter. You'll find sugar hiding in most of those products. In fact, you'll find added sugars in three-quarters of the more than 600,000 items available in grocery stores. But how is sugar hiding? Can't you just look on food labels? It's not that easy. Just like your friend Robert might go by Bob, Robby, Rob, Bobby, or Roberto, added sugar has a lot of aliases. And by a lot, we don't mean five or six, try fifty-six. There's brown rice syrup, barley malt, demerara, Florida Crystals, muscovado, and, of course, high fructose corn syrup, sometimes called HFCS, or corn sugar. Even sugar's tricky nicknames have nicknames. Grape or apple concentrate has the same effects on your body as its 55 sugary twins. And even though organic evaporated cane juice sounds healthy, when you evaporate it, you get sugar! Chemically speaking, it's all the same.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Say you're helping plan a friend's party, and he sends you a text asking you to "bring Bob, a DJ and a clown." You're pretty impressed. You had no idea Bob was so multitalented. But when the day arrives, it turns out that he's not, and you were supposed to bring three different people. As you and Bob sit at the silent, clownless party, it occurs to you that the confusion could've been avoided simply by using another comma after DJ. This final comma in a list, placed directly before the main conjunction, such as and, or, or nor, is called the serial comma, or Oxford comma. And it has long driven grammar nerds crazy because even major language institutions can't agree on whether it should be used. Ironically, the Oxford comma is more common in the United States, where it's recommended by the MLA, the Chicago Style Manual, and the US Government Printing Office, though not by the AP Style Book. In the UK and other English-speaking countries, most style guides do not support the comma's use, with the exception of its namesake, the Oxford University Press. Why not use the serial comma? One of the main arguments is that the conjunction is usually enough to denote a separate entity. And where it's not, like in your ill-fated invite list, changing the order of terms will usually do the job. Journalists also dislike the comma because it takes up precious space and can make text look cluttered. Sometimes, it can even create confusion of its own. For example, if your friend had asked for "Bob, a DJ and a puppy," you'd probably figure out that they're three separate beings. Puppies are cute, but they don't make great DJs. With the comma, you may think Bob is the DJ, and all you need is him and the puppy. The argument over the Oxford comma has raised such strong passions over the years that a sort of truce has been reached. The common wisdom is that its use is optional, and depends on whether it will help to avoid confusion. For one thing, you're supposed to keep your use or avoidance of the Oxford comma consistent throughout a whole piece of writing. So, using it only where necessary is not an option. And the very idea of a grammatical rule being optional is a bit odd. Imagine that you hadn't messed up the party planning, and read the next day that "everyone had a great time - ninjas, pirates, vikings, old and young." If the Oxford comma were standard, you would notice it missing and conclude that old and young must describe the awesome guests already listed. But as things stand, you will always wonder whether it means that a bunch of regular, boring kids and old people showed up as well. Ultimately, the serial comma may be useful or annoying, but your opinion on it, as for many optional things, probably has something to do with whichever style you were raised on. Your high school teachers favored it? It's likely you're still using it. Your first editor hated it? You probably do, too. And maybe so much hairsplitting over a tiny squiggle on a page is a bit silly. After all, there are so many bigger problems to worry about. But sometimes, little things can make a big difference.

**Transcript**:
We all know about the dinosaurs that once roamed the planet, but long after they went extinct, great beasts we call the megafauna lived on every continent. In the Americas, ground sloths the size of elephants pulled down trees with their claws. Saber-toothed cats the size of brown bears hunted in packs, but they were no match for short-faced bears, which stood thirteen feet on their hind legs, and are likely to have driven these cats away from their prey. There were armadillos as big as small cars, an eight foot beaver, and a bird with a 26 foot wingspan. Almost everywhere, the world's megafauna were driven to extinction, often by human hunters. Some species still survive in parts of Africa and Asia. In other places, you can still see the legacy of these great beasts. Most trees are able to resprout where their trunk is broken to withstand the loss of much of their bark and to survive splitting, twisting and trampling, partly because they evolved to survive attacks by elephants. The American pronghorn can run so fast because it evolved to escape the American cheetah. The surviving animals live in ghost ecosystems adapted to threats from species that no longer exist. Today, it may be possible to resurrect those ghosts, to bring back lost species using genetic material. For instance, there's been research in to cloning woolly mammoths from frozen remains. But even if it's not possible, we can still restore many of the ecosystems the world has lost. How? By making use of abandoned farms. As the market for food is globalized, infertile land becomes uncompetitive. Farmers in barren places can't compete with people growing crops on better land elsewhere. As a result, farming has started to retreat from many regions, and trees have started to return. One estimate claims that two-thirds of land in the US that was once forested but was cleared for farming has become forested again. Another estimate suggests that by 2030, an area in Europe the size of Poland will be vaccated by farmers. So even if we can't use DNA to bring back ground sloths and giant armadillos, we can restore bears, wolves, pumas lynx, moose and bison to the places where they used to live. Some of these animals can reshape their surroundings, creating conditions that allow other species to thrive. When wolves were reintroduced to the Yellowstone National Park in 1995, they quickly transformed the ecosystem. Where they reduced the numbers of overpopulated deer, vegetation began to recover. The height of some trees quintupled in just six years. As forests returned, so did songbirds. Beavers, which eat trees, multiplied in the rivers, and their dams provided homes for otters, muskrats, ducks, frogs and fish. The wolves killed coyotes, allowing rabbits and mice to increase, providing more food for hawks, weasels, foxes and badgers. Bald eagles and ravens fed on the carrion that the wolves abandoned. So did bears, which also ate the berries on the returning shrubs. Bison numbers rose as they browsed the revitalized forests. The wolves changed almost everything. This is an example of a trophic cascade, a change at the top of the food chain that tumbles all the way to the bottom, affecting every level. The discovery of widespread trophic cascades may be one of the most exciting scientific findings of the past half century. They tell us that ecosystems that have lost just one or two species of large animals can behave in radically different ways from those that retain them. All over the world, new movements are trying to catalyze the restoration of nature in a process called rewilding. This means undoing some of the damage we've caused, reestablishing species which have been driven out, and then stepping back. There is no attempt to create an ideal ecosystem, to produce a heath, a rainforest or a coral reef. Rewilding is about bringing back the species that drive dynamic processes and then letting nature take its course. But it's essential that rewilding must never be used as an excuse to push people off the land. It should happen only with the consent and enthusiasm of the people who work there. Imagine standing on a cliff in England, watching sperm whales attacking shoals of herring as they did within sight of the shore until the 18th century. By creating marine reserves in which no commerical fishing takes place, that can happen again. Imagine a European Serengeti full of the animals that used to live there: hippos, rhinos, elephants, hyenas and lions. What rewilding reintroduces, alongside the missing animals and plants, is that rare species called hope. It tells us that ecological change need not always proceed in the same direction. The silent spring could be followed by a wild summer.

So krypton is one of the noble gases, it’s
not very reactive but it does react with the element fluorine. Jim Turner,
who was my supervisor when I did my doctorate, was the first person
to discover that fluorine could react with krypton but even that reaction
requires quite bright lights to break the bond between the fluorine
atoms to get them to react. But krypton can also be used in lasers
when mixtures of krypton and of fluorine-containing compound can be
used to generate very bright pulses or intense pulses of ultraviolet light.
Some years ago we had a professor here who bought a really big krypton-fluoride
laser and when he switched it on and the beam hit the wall
it burnt a hole right through the wall so he knew where to make the hole
to get his beam into the next lab.

**Transcript**:
The politics of 19th Century Europe were messy. (What's changed?) It was made up of various Empires spreading across the world, trying to show each other who was the biggest power.  They each built up massive armies to stave off war, thinking that everyone else would be too scared to fight against them, or so they thought... Things all changed when a gang of Yugoslav nationalists who didn't like being part of Austria-Hungary shot the Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand while he was in Sarajevo. Swiftly the Austro-Hungarian Empire declared war on Serbia. Russia came in to aid Serbia, so Germany decided to declare war on Russia! Knowing that France would go to war with Germany, Germany decided to attack France quickly and invaded via neutral Belgium and Luxembourg and because of this, Great Britain stepped in to stop the Germans getting any closer. It was a mess of allegiances and old rivalries with two sides forming the allies and the central powers.  And so began what became known at the time as The Great War; the war to end all wars! A new form of warfare evolved as these fully industrialized armies with engines, machine guns, airplanes and new chemical gas weapons fought against each other.  It was the dawn of modern warfare.  At the time, national pride was at an all-time high and men were proud to go off and fight for their country. It was seen as a romantic idea to go off and be a hero! Boys as young as 12 managed to lie their way into the army ranks only to discover that it was not such a sweet and honourable thing to die for one's country!  Germany marched on Paris but was stopped by the French and both sides dug themselves into trenches in what became known as the Western Front.  On the Eastern Front, the Russians invaded Austria-Hungary but were stopped in Eastern Prussia by the Germans.  The Ottoman Empire joined in on the site of the Central Powers in 1914.  More and More nations from all over the world joined the fight as the war spread across Europe. Trench warfare was quite terrible.  Each army would dig a long network of trenches in the ground, fortifying the front with barbed wire and sandbags. I was a long stalemate where neither side dared advance on the other. Machine guns were a new and very effective weapon. When the time was right, the army would climb up over the top and charge across no-man's land to the enemy trench and capture it, thus gaining more land and taking another step towards their goal!  At least that was the plan... Spirits were high at least when the first Christmas came by.  Both forces climbed out of their trenches to celebrate Christmas together, talk, share stories and play football.  When Christmas ended, they would climb back into their trenches to become enemies once again. Conditions in the trenches were dreadful. 
 Soldiers in France and Belgium found their feet rotting away from the constant damp. In contrast, Australian, New Zealand and Ottoman soldiers fighting in Gallipoli had blisteringly hot trenches where rain and cold were replaced with dehydration and overheating.  Disease was everywhere in the trenches. 1916 saw a renewed push on the Western Front from both sides.  Thousands of French died at Verdun as the Germans unleashed their chlorine gas. The infamous Battle of the Somme was a long and grueling battle that lasted from July to November.  The first day alone saw over 80,000 men wounded or killed; mostly British, due to disastrous attacks. Fundamental errors and contradictions from the high command led to confusion and unclear plans. In places, soldiers weren't organized in time to charge so by the time that they got going, the artillery had stopped firing on the Germans, allowing them to easily fire upon their attackers. 
 Planes and artillery were supposed to clear the German barbed wire, but the shrapnel was ineffective against the wire. When the order came to go over the top, thousands of men ran out to their death to be caught on the barbed wire and picked off one by one by the German machine guns. this battle saw the first use of tanks by the British. Ultimately, France and Britain pushed against Germany and gained much ground.  By Christmas 1916, no man wanted good cheer wished upon their faceless enemy.  During 1916 also, before the Somme, Irish Republicans staged an uprising in Dublin in the hopes to catch Britain while they were distracted by the war. It was crushed by Britain but after executing the rebel leaders Irish support for Britain and the war dropped, at least in the south of Ireland. Most Irish troops after that came from the Protestant North. On the sea Britain mined many patches of international water to stop movement of German ships. Germany was blockaded.  After many naval battles, Britain tried to stay in control of the seas, above the water at least! Germany were on the attack with the u-boat submarines adding a new dimension to Naval Warfare; they could attack without warning!  They sank many ships including the ship The Lusitania and because this broke loads of war rules, it ultimately influenced the United States of America to enter the war... two years later!  The British pushed up through the Arabian peninsula with T.E. Lawrence aka Lawrence of Arabia helping to organize the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. In 1917, the Russians had a series of revolutions. In the February Revolution, the Tsars were gotten rid of, but Russia remained in the war, and the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks took control and brought power to the people and sowed the seeds for Communism in Russia. The Russians signed a treaty with Germany and pulled out of the war causing an initial difficulty for the enemies of the Central Powers.  The Allies however became refreshed with reinforcements from the United States of America who eventually decided to enter the war in 1917 after Germany tried to convince Mexico to attack them. Germany made a fierce and effective push before the allies could use their advantage.  However, American troops continued to arrive in such great numbers that Germany's army couldn't last any longer. The allies pushed up from Italy, the Balkans, and the Middle East putting Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire out of the war.  As the allies advanced the Western Front, Germany called for an armistice to stop the fighting, bringing victory to the allies and an end to the war.  The fighting stopped on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, 1918.  It took six months to negotiate terms and it was ultimately decided that the Central Powers were to pay for the damages they had caused in the war.  Germany only fully paid off this debt in 2010.  The map of Europe was redrawn. Soldiers who made it home again were changed men.  They were haunted by the horrors which they had seen in the trenches. Gas attacks, friends dying by their side, and the constant shelling of enemy artillery; they were shell-shocked and so many found it impossible to go back to normal life after the trenches.  Many great poets and writers were inspired by their hell in the trenches such as Wilfred Owen, JRR Tolkien and Ernest Hemingway of the so-called Lost Generation? Some survived, many did not. The world was a changed place after the World War. People had seen the death and destruction that could be dealt by mankind. The men who left to become heroes came back scarred, or worse never returned at all. The poppy is used to remember the millions who died in this war as it was just about the only flower to grow in the carnage-ridden wasteland between the trenches. The world was now a darker place.  People hoped that it would indeed be the war to end all wars! Unfortunately, they were mistaken...

**Transcript**:
A national hero? Or public enemy number one? Historical figures are often controversial, but few were as deified or vilified in their lifetime as the seventh President of the United States. This is History vs. Andrew Jackson. "Order, order, hm, uh, what were we...ah yes, Mr. Jackson! You stand accused of degrading the office of the presidency, causing financial collapse and wanton cruelty against American Indians. How do you plead?" "Now, Your Honor, I am not a big city lawyer, but I do know a few things. And I know that President Jackson was a self-made frontiersman, a great general, a real man of the people." "Your Honor, this 'man of the people' was a gambler, a drunk, and a brawler. Why, I've heard it said that he would fight at the drop of the hat and then drop the hat himself. I ask you, was such a man fit for the most distinguished office in the nation? Can we forget the debacle of his inauguration? Who ever heard of inviting a drunken mob into the White House? It took ages to get the upholstery clean." "That drunken mob, sir, was the American people, and they deserve to celebrate their victory." "Order, order! Now, did this celebration have pie?" "Very well. Mr. Jackson, is it not the case that immediately upon assuming office you introduced the spoils system, replacing hundreds of perfectly good federal employees with incompetent party loyalists?" "Your Honor, the President did no such thing. He tried to institute rotation in office to avoid any profiteering or funny business. It was the rest of the party who insisted on giving posts to their lackeys." "But Mr. Jackson complied, did he not?" "Now, uh, see here." "Moving on. Mr. Jackson, did you not help to cause the financial Panic of 1837, and the ensuing economic depression with your obsessive war against the Bank of the United States? Was not vetoing its reauthorization, as you did in 1832, an act of irresponsible populace pandering that made no economic sense?" "Your Honor, the gentleman has quite the imagination. That bank was just a way for rich Yanks to get richer. And all that money panic was caused when British banks raised interest rates and cut lending. To blame it on the President is preposterous, I say." "But if Mr. Jackson had not destroyed the National Bank, it would have been able to lend to farmers and businesses when other credit dried up, would it not?" "Hm, this is all highly speculative. Can we move on?" "Certainly, Your Honor. We now come to Mr. Jackson's most terrible offense: forcing entire tribes out of their native lands via the Indian Removal Act." "I resent that accusation, sir. The U.S. of A. bought that land from the Indians fair and square." "Do you call coercion and threats by a nation with a far more powerful army fair and square? Or signing a treaty for removing the Cherokee with a small group that didn't include their actual leaders? They didn't have time to properly supply themselves before the army came and forced them to march the Trail of Tears." "Now, hold on a minute. This was all Van Buren's doing after President Jackson left office." "But Mr. Jackson laid the groundwork and made sure the treaty was ratified. All President Van Buren had to do afterwards was enforce it." "Look here, Your Honor. Our government's been purchasing Indian land since the beginning, and my client was negotiating these deals even before he was President. President Jackson truly believed it was best for the Indians to get compensated for their land and move out West, where there was plenty of space for them to keep living the way they were accustomed, rather than stick around and keep butting heads with the white settlers. Some of whom, I remind our court, wanted to exterminate them outright. It was a different time." "And yet, even in this different time, there were many in Congress and even the Supreme Court who saw how wrong the Removal Act was and loudly opposed it, were there not?" "My client was under a great deal of pressure. I say, do you think it's easy governing such a huge country and keeping the Union together, when states are fixing to nullify federal laws? President Jackson barely got South Carolina to back down over those import tariffs, and then Georgia had to go discover gold and start grabbing up Cherokee land. It was either get the Indians to move or get in another fight with a state government." "So, you admit that Mr. Jackson sacrified moral principles to achieve some political goals?" "I do declare, show me one leader who hasn't." As societies change and morals evolve, yesterday's hero may become tomorrow's villain, or vice versa. History may be past, but our understanding of it is always on trial.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A national hero? Or public enemy number one? Historical figures are often controversial, but few were as deified or vilified in their lifetime as the seventh President of the United States. This is History vs. Andrew Jackson. "Order, order, hm, uh, what were we...ah yes, Mr. Jackson! You stand accused of degrading the office of the presidency, causing financial collapse and wanton cruelty against American Indians. How do you plead?" "Now, Your Honor, I am not a big city lawyer, but I do know a few things. And I know that President Jackson was a self-made frontiersman, a great general, a real man of the people." "Your Honor, this 'man of the people' was a gambler, a drunk, and a brawler. Why, I've heard it said that he would fight at the drop of the hat and then drop the hat himself. I ask you, was such a man fit for the most distinguished office in the nation? Can we forget the debacle of his inauguration? Who ever heard of inviting a drunken mob into the White House? It took ages to get the upholstery clean." "That drunken mob, sir, was the American people, and they deserve to celebrate their victory." "Order, order! Now, did this celebration have pie?" "Very well. Mr. Jackson, is it not the case that immediately upon assuming office you introduced the spoils system, replacing hundreds of perfectly good federal employees with incompetent party loyalists?" "Your Honor, the President did no such thing. He tried to institute rotation in office to avoid any profiteering or funny business. It was the rest of the party who insisted on giving posts to their lackeys." "But Mr. Jackson complied, did he not?" "Now, uh, see here." "Moving on. Mr. Jackson, did you not help to cause the financial Panic of 1837, and the ensuing economic depression with your obsessive war against the Bank of the United States? Was not vetoing its reauthorization, as you did in 1832, an act of irresponsible populace pandering that made no economic sense?" "Your Honor, the gentleman has quite the imagination. That bank was just a way for rich Yanks to get richer. And all that money panic was caused when British banks raised interest rates and cut lending. To blame it on the President is preposterous, I say." "But if Mr. Jackson had not destroyed the National Bank, it would have been able to lend to farmers and businesses when other credit dried up, would it not?" "Hm, this is all highly speculative. Can we move on?" "Certainly, Your Honor. We now come to Mr. Jackson's most terrible offense: forcing entire tribes out of their native lands via the Indian Removal Act." "I resent that accusation, sir. The U.S. of A. bought that land from the Indians fair and square." "Do you call coercion and threats by a nation with a far more powerful army fair and square? Or signing a treaty for removing the Cherokee with a small group that didn't include their actual leaders? They didn't have time to properly supply themselves before the army came and forced them to march the Trail of Tears." "Now, hold on a minute. This was all Van Buren's doing after President Jackson left office." "But Mr. Jackson laid the groundwork and made sure the treaty was ratified. All President Van Buren had to do afterwards was enforce it." "Look here, Your Honor. Our government's been purchasing Indian land since the beginning, and my client was negotiating these deals even before he was President. President Jackson truly believed it was best for the Indians to get compensated for their land and move out West, where there was plenty of space for them to keep living the way they were accustomed, rather than stick around and keep butting heads with the white settlers. Some of whom, I remind our court, wanted to exterminate them outright. It was a different time." "And yet, even in this different time, there were many in Congress and even the Supreme Court who saw how wrong the Removal Act was and loudly opposed it, were there not?" "My client was under a great deal of pressure. I say, do you think it's easy governing such a huge country and keeping the Union together, when states are fixing to nullify federal laws? President Jackson barely got South Carolina to back down over those import tariffs, and then Georgia had to go discover gold and start grabbing up Cherokee land. It was either get the Indians to move or get in another fight with a state government." "So, you admit that Mr. Jackson sacrified moral principles to achieve some political goals?" "I do declare, show me one leader who hasn't." As societies change and morals evolve, yesterday's hero may become tomorrow's villain, or vice versa. History may be past, but our understanding of it is always on trial.
