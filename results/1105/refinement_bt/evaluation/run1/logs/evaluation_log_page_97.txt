**Transcript**:
One of the most remarkable aspects
of the human brain is its ability to recognize patterns
and describe them. Among the hardest patterns
we've tried to understand is the concept of
turbulent flow in fluid dynamics. The German physicist
Werner Heisenberg said, "When I meet God,
I'm going to ask him two questions: why relativity and why turbulence? I really believe he will have
an answer for the first." As difficult as turbulence is
to understand mathematically, we can use art to depict the way it looks. In June 1889, Vincent van Gogh
painted the view just before sunrise from the window of his room
at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he'd admitted himself after
mutilating his own ear in a psychotic episode. In "The Starry Night,"
his circular brushstrokes create a night sky filled
with swirling clouds and eddies of stars. Van Gogh and other Impressionists
represented light in a different way than their predecessors, seeming to capture
its motion, for instance, across sun-dappled waters, or here in star light
that twinkles and melts through milky waves of blue night sky. The effect is caused by luminance, the intensity of the light
in the colors on the canvas. The more primitive part
of our visual cortex, which sees light contrast
and motion, but not color, will blend two differently
colored areas together if they have the same luminance. But our brains' primate subdivision will see the contrasting colors
without blending. With these two interpretations
happening at once, the light in many Impressionist works
seems to pulse, flicker and radiate oddly. That's how this
and other Impressionist works use quickly executed
prominent brushstrokes to capture something strikingly real
about how light moves. Sixty years later, Russian
mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov furthered our mathematical
understanding of turbulence when he proposed that energy
in a turbulent fluid at length R varies in proportion to
the 5/3rds power of R. Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov was remarkably close
to the way turbulent flow works, although a complete description
of turbulence remains one of the unsolved
problems in physics. A turbulent flow is self-similar
if there is an energy cascade. In other words, big eddies
transfer their energy to smaller eddies, which do likewise at other scales. Examples of this include
Jupiter's Great Red Spot, cloud formations
and interstellar dust particles. In 2004, using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists saw the eddies of a distant
cloud of dust and gas around a star, and it reminded them
of Van Gogh's "Starry Night." This motivated scientists
from Mexico, Spain and England to study the luminance
in Van Gogh's paintings in detail. They discovered that there is a distinct
pattern of turbulent fluid structures close to Kolmogorov's equation
hidden in many of Van Gogh's paintings. The researchers digitized the paintings, and measured how brightness varies
between any two pixels. From the curves measured
for pixel separations, they concluded that paintings from
Van Gogh's period of psychotic agitation behave remarkably similar
to fluid turbulence. His self-portrait with a pipe, from
a calmer period in Van Gogh's life, showed no sign of this correspondence. And neither did other artists' work that seemed equally
turbulent at first glance, like Munch's "The Scream." While it's too easy to say
Van Gogh's turbulent genius enabled him to depict turbulence, it's also far too difficult to accurately
express the rousing beauty of the fact that in a period of intense suffering, Van Gogh was somehow
able to perceive and represent one of the most supremely
difficult concepts nature has ever brought before mankind, and to unite his unique mind's eye with the deepest mysteries
of movement, fluid and light.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, some generated MCQs discuss related topics, such as turbulence and fluid dynamics.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would select Question 3 or Question 12. Both of these questions discuss turbulence and the mathematical concept proposed by Andrey Kolmogorov. However, they do not directly address the ground truth MCQ's question about whether a complete description of turbulence is an unsolved problem in physics.

its motion, for instance, across sun-dappled waters, or here in star light
that twinkles and melts through milky waves of blue night sky. The effect is caused by luminance, the intensity of the light
in the colors on the canvas. The more primitive part
of our visual cortex, which sees light contrast
and motion, but not color, will blend two differently
colored areas together if they have the same luminance. But our brains' primate subdivision will see the contrasting colors
without blending. With these two interpretations
happening at once, the light in many Impressionist works
seems to pulse, flicker and radiate oddly. That's how this
and other Impressionist works use quickly executed
prominent brushstrokes to capture something strikingly real
about how light moves. Sixty years later, Russian
mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov furthered our mathematical
understanding of turbulence when he proposed that energy
in a turbulent fluid at length R varies in proportion to
the 5/3rds power of R. Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov was remarkably close
to the way turbulent flow works, although a complete description
of turbulence remains one of the unsolved
problems in physics. A turbulent flow is self-similar
if there is an energy cascade. In other words, big eddies
transfer their energy to smaller eddies, which do likewise at other scales. Examples of this include
Jupiter's Great Red Spot, cloud formations
and interstellar dust particles. In 2004, using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists saw the eddies of a distant
cloud of dust and gas around a star, and it reminded them
of Van Gogh's "Starry Night." This motivated scientists
from Mexico, Spain and England to study the luminance
in Van Gogh's paintings in detail. They discovered that there is a distinct
pattern of turbulent fluid structures close to Kolmogorov's equation
hidden in many of Van Gogh's paintings. The researchers digitized the paintings, and measured how brightness varies
between any two pixels. From the curves measured
for pixel separations, they concluded that paintings from
Van Gogh's period of psychotic agitation behave remarkably similar
to fluid turbulence. His self-portrait with a pipe, from
a calmer period in Van Gogh's life, showed no sign of this correspondence. And neither did other artists' work that seemed equally
turbulent at first glance, like Munch's "The Scream." While it's too easy to say
Van Gogh's turbulent genius enabled him to depict turbulence, it's also far too difficult to accurately
express the rousing beauty of the fact that in a period of intense suffering, Van Gogh was somehow
able to perceive and represent one of the most supremely
difficult concepts nature has ever brought before mankind, and to unite his unique mind's eye with the deepest mysteries
of movement, fluid and light.

**Transcript**:
One of the most remarkable aspects
of the human brain is its ability to recognize patterns
and describe them. Among the hardest patterns
we've tried to understand is the concept of
turbulent flow in fluid dynamics. The German physicist
Werner Heisenberg said, "When I meet God,
I'm going to ask him two questions: why relativity and why turbulence? I really believe he will have
an answer for the first." As difficult as turbulence is
to understand mathematically, we can use art to depict the way it looks. In June 1889, Vincent van Gogh
painted the view just before sunrise from the window of his room
at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he'd admitted himself after
mutilating his own ear in a psychotic episode. In "The Starry Night,"
his circular brushstrokes create a night sky filled
with swirling clouds and eddies of stars. Van Gogh and other Impressionists
represented light in a different way than their predecessors, seeming to capture
its motion, for instance, across sun-dappled waters, or here in star light
that twinkles and melts through milky waves of blue night sky. The effect is caused by luminance, the intensity of the light
in the colors on the canvas. The more primitive part
of our visual cortex, which sees light contrast
and motion, but not color, will blend two differently
colored areas together if they have the same luminance. But our brains' primate subdivision will see the contrasting colors
without blending. With these two interpretations
happening at once, the light in many Impressionist works
seems to pulse, flicker and radiate oddly. That's how this
and other Impressionist works use quickly executed
prominent brushstrokes to capture something strikingly real

**Transcript**:
Would mathematics exist if people didn't? Since ancient times, 
mankind has hotly debated whether mathematics 
was discovered or invented. Did we create mathematical concepts to
help us understand the universe around us, or is math the native language of
the universe itself, existing whether we find 
its truths or not? Are numbers, polygons 
and equations truly real, or merely ethereal representations
of some theoretical ideal? The independent reality of math has
some ancient advocates. The Pythagoreans of 5th Century Greece
believed numbers were both living entities and universal principles. They called the number one, "the monad,"
the generator of all other numbers and source of all creation. Numbers were active agents in nature. Plato argued mathematical 
concepts were concrete and as real as the universe itself,
regardless of our knowledge of them. Euclid, the father of geometry, believed
nature itself was the physical manifestation
of mathematical laws. Others argue that while numbers may
or may not exist physically, mathematical statements definitely don't. Their truth values are based on rules
that humans created. Mathematics is thus an invented
logic exercise, with no existence outside mankind's
conscious thought, a language of abstract relationships
based on patterns discerned by brains, built to use those patterns to invent
useful but artificial order from chaos. One proponent of this sort of idea
was Leopold Kronecker, a professor of mathematics in 
19th century Germany. His belief is summed up in 
his famous statement: "God created the natural numbers,
all else is the work of man." During mathematician
David Hilbert's lifetime, there was a push to establish mathematics
as a logical construct. Hilbert attempted to axiomatize all
of mathematics, as Euclid had done with geometry. He and others who attempted this saw
mathematics as a deeply philosophical game but a game nonetheless. Henri Poincaré, one of the father's of
non-Euclidean geometry, believed that the existence of 
non-Euclidean geometry, dealing with the non-flat surfaces of 
hyperbolic and elliptical curvatures, proved that Euclidean geometry, the
long standing geometry of flat surfaces, was not a universal truth, but rather one outcome of using one
particular set of game rules. But in 1960, Nobel Physics laureate
Eugene Wigner coined the phrase, "the unreasonable 
effectiveness of mathematics," pushing strongly for the idea that
mathematics is real and discovered by people. Wigner pointed out that many purely
mathematical theories developed in a vacuum, often with no view
towards describing any physical phenomena, have proven decades 
or even centuries later, to be the framework necessary to explain how the universe
has been working all along. For instance, the number theory of British
mathematician Gottfried Hardy, who had boasted that none of his work
would ever be found useful in describing any phenomena
in the real world, helped establish cryptography. Another piece of his purely
theoretical work became known as the Hardy-Weinberg
law in genetics, and won a Nobel prize. And Fibonacci stumbled 
upon his famous sequence while looking at the growth of an 
idealized rabbit population. Mankind later found the sequence
everywhere in nature, from sunflower seeds
and flower petal arrangements, to the structure of a pineapple, even the branching of bronchi
in the lungs. Or there's the non-Euclidean work of
Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s, which Einstein used in the model for
general relativity a century later. Here's an even bigger jump: mathematical knot theory, first developed
around 1771 to describe the geometry of position, was used in the late 20th century
to explain how DNA unravels itself during the replication process. It may even provide key explanations
for string theory. Some of the most influential 
mathematicians and scientists of all of human history
have chimed in on the issue as well, often in surprising ways. So, is mathematics an 
invention or a discovery? Artificial construct or
universal truth? Human product or
natural, possibly divine, creation? These questions are so deep the debate
often becomes spiritual in nature. The answer might depend on the specific
concept being looked at, but it can all feel like a
distorted zen koan. If there's a number of trees in a forest,
but no one's there to count them, does that number exist?

**Transcript**:
Would mathematics exist if people didn't? Since ancient times, 
mankind has hotly debated whether mathematics 
was discovered or invented. Did we create mathematical concepts to
help us understand the universe around us, or is math the native language of
the universe itself, existing whether we find 
its truths or not? Are numbers, polygons 
and equations truly real, or merely ethereal representations
of some theoretical ideal? The independent reality of math has
some ancient advocates. The Pythagoreans of 5th Century Greece
believed numbers were both living entities and universal principles. They called the number one, "the monad,"
the generator of all other numbers and source of all creation. Numbers were active agents in nature. Plato argued mathematical 
concepts were concrete and as real as the universe itself,
regardless of our knowledge of them. Euclid, the father of geometry, believed
nature itself was the physical manifestation
of mathematical laws. Others argue that while numbers may
or may not exist physically, mathematical statements definitely don't. Their truth values are based on rules
that humans created. Mathematics is thus an invented
logic exercise, with no existence outside mankind's
conscious thought, a language of abstract relationships
based on patterns discerned by brains, built to use those patterns to invent
useful but artificial order from chaos. One proponent of this sort of idea
was Leopold Kronecker, a professor of mathematics in 
19th century Germany. His belief is summed up in 
his famous statement: "God created the natural numbers,
all else is the work of man." During mathematician
David Hilbert's lifetime, there was a push to establish mathematics
as a logical construct. Hilbert attempted to axiomatize all
of mathematics, as Euclid had done with geometry. He and others who attempted this saw
mathematics as a deeply philosophical game but a game nonetheless. Henri Poincaré, one of the father's of
non-Euclidean geometry, believed that the existence of 
non-Euclidean geometry, dealing with the non-flat surfaces of 
hyperbolic and elliptical curvatures, proved that Euclidean geometry, the
long standing geometry of flat surfaces, was not a universal truth, but rather one outcome of using one
particular set of game rules. But in 1960, Nobel Physics laureate
Eugene Wigner coined the phrase, "the unreasonable 
effectiveness of mathematics," pushing strongly for the idea that
mathematics is real and discovered by people. Wigner pointed out that many purely
mathematical theories developed in a vacuum, often with no view
towards describing any physical phenomena, have proven decades 
or even centuries later, to be the framework necessary to explain how the universe
has been working all along. For instance, the number theory of British
mathematician Gottfried Hardy, who had boasted that none of his work
would ever be found useful in describing any phenomena
in the real world, helped establish cryptography. Another piece of his purely
theoretical work became known as the Hardy-Weinberg
law in genetics, and won a Nobel prize. And Fibonacci stumbled 
upon his famous sequence while looking at the growth of an 
idealized rabbit population. Mankind later found the sequence
everywhere in nature, from sunflower seeds
and flower petal arrangements, to the structure of a pineapple, even the branching of bronchi
in the lungs. Or there's the non-Euclidean work of
Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s, which Einstein used in the model for
general relativity a century later. Here's an even bigger jump: mathematical knot theory, first developed
around 1771 to describe the geometry of position, was used in the late 20th century

We usually think of rhythm
as an element of music, but it's actually found everywhere in
the world around us, from the ocean tides
to our own heartbeats, rhythm is essentially an event repeating
regularly over time. Even the ticking of a clock itself
is a sort of rhythm. But for musical rhythm, a steady string of repeating single
beats is not enough. For that, we need at least one opposing
beat with a different sound, which can be the unstressed off beat
or the accented back beat. There are several ways to make
these beats distinct, whether by using high and low drums,
or long and short beats. Which ends up being heard as the main
beat is not a precise rule, but like the famous Rubin's vase, can be
reversed depending on cultural perception. In standard notation, rhythm is indicated
on a musical bar line, but there are other ways. Remember that ticking clock? Just as its round face can trace the
linear passage of time, the flow of rhythm can be 
traced in a circle. The continuity of a wheel can be
a more intuitive way to visualize rhythm than a linear score that requires moving
back and forth along the page. We can mark the beats at different
positions around the circle using blue dots for main beats,
orange ones for off beats, and white dots for secondary beats. Here is a basic two beat rhythm with
a main beat and an opposing off beat. Or a three beat rhythm with a main beat,
an off beat, and a secondary beat. And the spaces between each beat
can be divided into further sub-beats using multiples of either two or three. Layering multiple patterns using
concentric wheels lets us create more complex rhythms. For example, we can combine a basic 
two beat rhythm with off beats to get a four beat system. This is the recognizable backbone of
many genres popular around the world, from rock, country, and jazz, to reggae and cumbia. Or we can combine a two beat
rhythm with a three beat one. Eliminating the extra main beat
and rotating the inner wheel leaves us with a rhythm whose 
underlying feel is three-four. This is the basis of the music of
Whirling Dervishes, as well as a broad range of 
Latin American rhythms, such as Joropo, and even Bach's famous Chaconne. Now if we remember Rubin's vase
and hear the off beats as the main beats, this will give us a six-eight feel, as found in genres such as Chacarera, and Quechua, Persian music and more. In an eight beat system,
we have three layered circles, each rhythm played by 
a different instrument. We can then add an outermost layer consisting of an additive 
rhythmic component, reinforcing the main beat
and increasing accuracy. Now let's remove everything
except for this combined rhythm and the basic two beat on top. This rhythmic configuration is found
as the Cuban cinquillo, in the Puerto Rican bomba, and in Northern Romanian music. And rotating the outer circle
90 degrees counterclockwise gives us a pattern often found
in Middle Eastern music, as well as Brazilian choro, and Argentinian tango. In all of these examples, the underlying
rhythm reinforces the basic one-two, but in different ways depending on 
arrangement and cultural context. So it turns out that the wheel method
is more than just a nifty way of visualizing complex rhythms. By freeing us from the tyranny
of the bar line, we can visualize rhythm 
in terms of time, and a simple turn of the wheel can take us
on a musical journey around the world.

is a sort of rhythm. But for musical rhythm, a steady string of repeating single
beats is not enough. For that, we need at least one opposing
beat with a different sound, which can be the unstressed off beat
or the accented back beat. There are several ways to make
these beats distinct, whether by using high and low drums,
or long and short beats. Which ends up being heard as the main
beat is not a precise rule, but like the famous Rubin's vase, can be

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the main tools of rhythm construction, and the correct option is "Additive and divisive." Although none of the generated MCQs ask the same question, Question 3: "How can the beats in a rhythm be made distinct?" has a similar intent, as it discusses the ways to create distinct beats in a rhythm.

However, a closer match is not found in the provided generated MCQs, as none of them discuss the main tools of rhythm construction. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5: "What is the wheel method used for in visualizing rhythm?" is the most similar, as it discusses a method used in rhythm construction, but it's still a very weak match.

If I really had to choose one, I would say:

arrangement and cultural context. So it turns out that the wheel method
is more than just a nifty way of visualizing complex rhythms. By freeing us from the tyranny
of the bar line, we can visualize rhythm 
in terms of time, and a simple turn of the wheel can take us
on a musical journey around the world.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 9: What is the rhythmic configuration found in the Cuban cinquillo, the Puerto Rican bomba, and Northern Romanian music?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and intent. Both questions deal with identifying the rhythmic configuration or rhythm wheel shared by specific music genres or groups.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the shared rhythm wheel of Joropo, Persian 6/8, and Chaconne. If I had to choose the most similar question, I would choose Question 9, but with the understanding that it is not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
The city sky is, frankly, rather boring. If you look up at the patches of
murk between buildings, you might be able to pick out
The Big Dipper, or perhaps, Orion's Belt. But hold on.  Look at that murky patch again
and hold our your thumb. How many stars do you think
are behind it? Ten, twenty? Guess again. If you looked at that
thumbnail-sized patch of sky with the Hubble Space Telescope, instead of points of light,
you'd see smudges. These aren't stars. They're galaxies, just like our Milky Way. Cities of billions of stars, and more than 1,000 of them
are hidden behind your thumb. The universe is bigger than
you can see from the city, and even bigger than the starry sky
you can see from the countryside. This is the universe as 
astrophysicists see it, with more stars than all the grains
of sand on Earth. By staring up at the stars at night, you've taken part in the oldest science
in human history. The study of the heavens is older than navigation, agriculture, perhaps
even language itself. Yet unlike other sciences,
astronomy is purely observational. We cannot control the parameters
of our experiments from lab benches. Our best technology can send
man to the moon, and probes to the edge of 
the solar system. But these distances are vanishingly small compared to the yawning gulfs 
between stars. So how can we know so much
about other galaxies, what they're made of, how many there are,
or that they're even there at all? Well, we can start with the first thing we
see when we look up at night: the stars. What we are trying to learn
is their properties. What are they made of? How hot are they?
How massive? How old? How far are they from Earth? And believe it or not, we can learn all of these things
simply from the light shining in the sky. We can decipher one kind of stellar message
by turning starlight into rainbows. When you look at a rainbow on Earth, you're really looking at light
from our Sun being scattered through water droplets
in the atmosphere into all the different wavelengths
that make it up. And we study the light from other stars, we can create rainbows on demand
using not water droplets, but other specific instruments that
disperse light. When we look at the scattered
light from our sun, we see something strange:
dark lines in our rainbow. These lines are the characteristic
fingerprints of atoms. Each type of atom in the solar atmosphere
soaks up light at specific wavelengths, and the amount of absorption depends on
how many of these atoms there are. So by observing how much light is missing
at these characteristic wavelengths, we can tell not only what elements are
in the Sun's atmosphere, but even their concentrations. And the same idea can be applied to
study other stars. Make a spectral rainbow, 
see what's missing, and figure out which elements are present. Bingo. Now you know what stars
are made of. But we aren't restricted to just
the wavelengths that our eyes perceive. Consider radio waves. Yes, they can bring the Billboard Top 100
to your car, but they can also travel almost
unimpeded through space. Because they've come so far, radio waves can tell us the very
early history of the universe, from just a few thousand years
after The Big Bang. We can also study the infrared light,
emitted by colder objects, like the gas and dust clouds in space, and the ultraviolet light from the hot
stars recently born from those clouds. Studying different wavelengths 
not only gives us a more complete picture
of any single object but also different views of the universe. For this reason, astrophysicists use
several different kinds of telescopes covering the spectrum from the infrared
to the ultraviolet to the X-ray, from giant radio dishes to giant
silver mirrors to space satellites, detecting light that would be otherwise
blocked by the Earth's atmosphere. Astrophysicists don't just see the billions of stars among
the billions of galaxies in the universe. They hear, feel and sense them
through many channels, each revealing a different story. But it all begins with light,
the kind we can see and the kind we can't. Want to know the secrets of the Universe? Just follow the light.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar.

Question 3 asks about what astrophysicists can learn about other galaxies by studying the light shining in the sky, which is related to the topic of observing the night sky and understanding the universe. However, it does not specifically address the issue of why the night sky looks empty in cities.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 3 (index 3) is the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

It's worth noting that the generated MCQs seem to focus more on the topics of astronomy, light, and the universe, whereas the ground truth MCQ is more specific to the issue of light pollution in cities and its effect on our perception of the night sky.

stars recently born from those clouds. Studying different wavelengths 
not only gives us a more complete picture
of any single object but also different views of the universe. For this reason, astrophysicists use
several different kinds of telescopes covering the spectrum from the infrared
to the ultraviolet to the X-ray, from giant radio dishes to giant
silver mirrors to space satellites, detecting light that would be otherwise
blocked by the Earth's atmosphere. Astrophysicists don't just see the billions of stars among
the billions of galaxies in the universe. They hear, feel and sense them
through many channels, each revealing a different story. But it all begins with light,
the kind we can see and the kind we can't. Want to know the secrets of the Universe? Just follow the light.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the smudges seen in the Hubble Telescope images and what they represent. 

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ. Although it doesn't directly ask about the smudges, it does ask about the number of galaxies hidden behind a thumbnail-sized patch of sky, which is related to the concept of the smudges being galaxies. However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar one, I would say it's Question 1, but with a low confidence level due to the difference in question intent and content.

**Transcript**:
The city sky is, frankly, rather boring. If you look up at the patches of
murk between buildings, you might be able to pick out
The Big Dipper, or perhaps, Orion's Belt. But hold on.  Look at that murky patch again
and hold our your thumb. How many stars do you think
are behind it? Ten, twenty? Guess again. If you looked at that
thumbnail-sized patch of sky with the Hubble Space Telescope, instead of points of light,
you'd see smudges. These aren't stars. They're galaxies, just like our Milky Way. Cities of billions of stars, and more than 1,000 of them
are hidden behind your thumb. The universe is bigger than
you can see from the city, and even bigger than the starry sky
you can see from the countryside. This is the universe as 
astrophysicists see it, with more stars than all the grains
of sand on Earth. By staring up at the stars at night, you've taken part in the oldest science
in human history. The study of the heavens is older than navigation, agriculture, perhaps
even language itself. Yet unlike other sciences,
astronomy is purely observational. We cannot control the parameters
of our experiments from lab benches. Our best technology can send
man to the moon, and probes to the edge of 
the solar system. But these distances are vanishingly small compared to the yawning gulfs 
between stars. So how can we know so much
about other galaxies, what they're made of, how many there are,
or that they're even there at all? Well, we can start with the first thing we
see when we look up at night: the stars. What we are trying to learn
is their properties. What are they made of? How hot are they?
How massive? How old? How far are they from Earth? And believe it or not, we can learn all of these things
simply from the light shining in the sky. We can decipher one kind of stellar message
by turning starlight into rainbows. When you look at a rainbow on Earth, you're really looking at light
from our Sun being scattered through water droplets
in the atmosphere into all the different wavelengths
that make it up. And we study the light from other stars, we can create rainbows on demand
using not water droplets, but other specific instruments that
disperse light. When we look at the scattered
light from our sun, we see something strange:
dark lines in our rainbow. These lines are the characteristic
fingerprints of atoms. Each type of atom in the solar atmosphere
soaks up light at specific wavelengths, and the amount of absorption depends on
how many of these atoms there are. So by observing how much light is missing
at these characteristic wavelengths, we can tell not only what elements are
in the Sun's atmosphere, but even their concentrations. And the same idea can be applied to
study other stars. Make a spectral rainbow, 
see what's missing, and figure out which elements are present. Bingo. Now you know what stars
are made of. But we aren't restricted to just
the wavelengths that our eyes perceive. Consider radio waves. Yes, they can bring the Billboard Top 100
to your car, but they can also travel almost
unimpeded through space. Because they've come so far, radio waves can tell us the very
early history of the universe, from just a few thousand years
after The Big Bang. We can also study the infrared light,
emitted by colder objects, like the gas and dust clouds in space, and the ultraviolet light from the hot
stars recently born from those clouds. Studying different wavelengths 
not only gives us a more complete picture
of any single object but also different views of the universe. For this reason, astrophysicists use

**Transcript**:
How many times does the chorus repeat
in your favorite song? And, take a moment to think,
how many times have you listened to it? Chances are you've heard that chorus
repeated dozens, if not hundreds, of times, and it's not just popular songs in the West
that repeat a lot. Repetition is a feature that music from
cultures around the world tends to share. So, why does music rely
so heavily on repetition? One part of the answer come from what
psychologists call the mere-exposure effect. In short, people tend to prefer things
they've been exposed to before. For example, a song comes on the radio
that we don't particularly like, but then we hear the song at
the grocery store, at the movie theater and again on the street corner. Soon, we are tapping to the beat,
singing the words, even downloading the track. This mere-exposure effect doesn't
just work for songs. It also works for everything 
from shapes to Super Bowl ads. So, what makes repetition so
uniquely prevalent in music? To investigate, psychologists asked
people to listen to musical compositions that avoided exact repetition. They heard excerpts from these pieces
in either their original form, or in a version that had been digitally
altered to include repetition. Although the original versions
had been composed by some of the most respected 
20th century composers, and the repetitive versions had been
assembled by brute force audio editing, people rated the repetitive versions
as more enjoyable, more interesting and more likely to have been
composed by a human artist. Musical repetition is deeply compelling. Think about the Muppets classic,
"Mahna Mahna." If you've heard it before, it's almost impossible after I sing,
"Mahna mahna," not to respond, "Do doo do do do." Repetition connects each bit of music irresistibly to the next bit 
of music that follows it. So when you hear a few notes,
you're already imagining what's coming next. Your mind is unconsciously singing along, and without noticing,
you might start humming out loud. Recent studies have shown that when
people hear a segment of music repeated, they are more likely to move
or tap along to it. Repetition invites us into music
as imagined participants, rather than as passive listeners. Research has also shown that listeners shift their attention
across musical repetitions, focusing on different aspects of
the sound on each new listen. You might notice the melody
of a phrase the first time, but when it's repeated, your attention
shifts to how the guitarist bends a pitch. This also occurs in language,
with something called semantic satiation. Repeating a word like atlas ad nauseam can make you stop thinking about 
what the word means, and instead focus on the sounds:
the odd way the "L" follows the "T." In this way, repetition can 
open up new worlds of sound not accessible on first hearing. The "L" following the "T" might not be
aesthetically relevant to "atlas," but the guitarist pitch bending
might be of critical expressive importance. The speech to song illusion
captures how simply repeating a sentence a number of times
shifts listeners attention to the pitch and temporal
aspects of the sound, so that the repeated spoken language actually begins to sound
like it is being sung. A similar effect happens with 
random sequences of sound. People will rate random sequences
they've heard on repeated loop as more musical than a random
sequence they've only heard once. Repetition gives rise to a kind of
orientation to sound that we think of as distinctively musical,
where we're listening along with the sound, engaging imaginatively with the note
about to happen. This mode of listening ties in with our
susceptibility to musical ear worms, where segments of music
burrow into our head, and play again and again,
as if stuck on repeat. Critics are often embarrassed
by music's repetitiveness, finding it childish or regressive, but repetition, far from an embarrassment,
is actually a key feature that gives rise to the kind of experience
we think about as musical.

where we're listening along with the sound, engaging imaginatively with the note
about to happen. This mode of listening ties in with our
susceptibility to musical ear worms, where segments of music
burrow into our head, and play again and again,
as if stuck on repeat. Critics are often embarrassed
by music's repetitiveness, finding it childish or regressive, but repetition, far from an embarrassment,

**Transcript**:
How many times does the chorus repeat
in your favorite song? And, take a moment to think,
how many times have you listened to it? Chances are you've heard that chorus
repeated dozens, if not hundreds, of times, and it's not just popular songs in the West
that repeat a lot. Repetition is a feature that music from
cultures around the world tends to share. So, why does music rely
so heavily on repetition? One part of the answer come from what
psychologists call the mere-exposure effect. In short, people tend to prefer things
they've been exposed to before. For example, a song comes on the radio
that we don't particularly like, but then we hear the song at
the grocery store, at the movie theater and again on the street corner. Soon, we are tapping to the beat,
singing the words, even downloading the track. This mere-exposure effect doesn't
just work for songs. It also works for everything 
from shapes to Super Bowl ads. So, what makes repetition so
uniquely prevalent in music? To investigate, psychologists asked
people to listen to musical compositions that avoided exact repetition. They heard excerpts from these pieces
in either their original form, or in a version that had been digitally
altered to include repetition. Although the original versions
had been composed by some of the most respected 
20th century composers, and the repetitive versions had been
assembled by brute force audio editing, people rated the repetitive versions
as more enjoyable, more interesting and more likely to have been
composed by a human artist. Musical repetition is deeply compelling. Think about the Muppets classic,
"Mahna Mahna." If you've heard it before, it's almost impossible after I sing,
"Mahna mahna," not to respond, "Do doo do do do." Repetition connects each bit of music irresistibly to the next bit 
of music that follows it. So when you hear a few notes,
you're already imagining what's coming next. Your mind is unconsciously singing along, and without noticing,
you might start humming out loud. Recent studies have shown that when
people hear a segment of music repeated, they are more likely to move
or tap along to it. Repetition invites us into music
as imagined participants, rather than as passive listeners. Research has also shown that listeners shift their attention
across musical repetitions, focusing on different aspects of
the sound on each new listen. You might notice the melody
of a phrase the first time, but when it's repeated, your attention
shifts to how the guitarist bends a pitch. This also occurs in language,
with something called semantic satiation. Repeating a word like atlas ad nauseam can make you stop thinking about 
what the word means, and instead focus on the sounds:
the odd way the "L" follows the "T." In this way, repetition can 
open up new worlds of sound not accessible on first hearing. The "L" following the "T" might not be
aesthetically relevant to "atlas," but the guitarist pitch bending
might be of critical expressive importance. The speech to song illusion
captures how simply repeating a sentence a number of times
shifts listeners attention to the pitch and temporal
aspects of the sound, so that the repeated spoken language actually begins to sound
like it is being sung. A similar effect happens with 
random sequences of sound. People will rate random sequences
they've heard on repeated loop as more musical than a random
sequence they've only heard once. Repetition gives rise to a kind of
orientation to sound that we think of as distinctively musical,
where we're listening along with the sound, engaging imaginatively with the note
about to happen. This mode of listening ties in with our
susceptibility to musical ear worms, where segments of music

**Transcript**:
Diabetes mellitus has been a scourge
of the developed world with an estimated 400,000,000 people
worldwide suffering from this disease, and 50% more predicted
within twenty years. Its early symptoms, which include increased thirst
and large volumes of urine, were recognized as far back
as 1500 BCE in Egypt. While the term diabetes,
meaning "to pass through," was first used in 250 BCE by the Greek physician
Apollonius of Memphis, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, associated respectively
with youth and obesity, were identified as separate conditions by Indian physicians
somewhere in the 5th century CE. But despite the disease being known, a diagnosis of diabetes in a human patient would remain tantamount
to a death sentence until the early 20th century,
its causes unknown. What changed this dire situation was the help of humanity's
longtime animal partner: Canis lupus familiaris, domesticated from Grey wolves
thousands of years ago. In 1890, the German scientists
Von Mering and Minkowski demonstrated that removing
a dog's pancreas caused it to develop
all the signs of diabetes, thus establishing the organ's
central role in the disease. But the exact mechanism
by which this occurred remained a mystery until 1920, when a young Canadian surgeon
named Frederick Banting and his student, Charles Best, advanced the findings
of their German colleagues. Working under Professor Macleod
at the University of Toronto, they confirmed that the pancreas was
responsible for regulating blood glucose, successfully treating diabetic dogs
by injecting them with an extract they had prepared from pancreas tissue. By 1922, the researchers working
with biochemist James Collip were able to develop a similar extract
from beef pancreas to first treat a 14-year-old diabetic boy, followed by six additional patients. The manufacturing process
for this extract, now known as insulin, was eventually turned over
to a pharmaceutical company that makes different types
of injectable insulin to this day. Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize for Medicine
in 1923 for their discovery. But Banting chose to share
his portion with Charles Best, for his help in the initial
studies involving dogs. But while medical experimentation
on animals remains controversial, in this case at least, it was not just a matter
of exploiting dogs for human needs. Dogs develop diabetes at the rate
of two cases per 1,000 dogs, almost the same
as that of humans under 20. Most canine cases are of Type 1 diabetes, similar to the type
that young children develop following immune system
destruction of the pancreas, and genetic studies have shown that the dog disease has many
similar hallmarks of the human disease. This has allowed veterinarians
to turn the tables, successfully using insulin
to treat diabetes in man's best friend for over 60 years. Many dog owners commit
to managing their dogs' diabetes with insulin injected twice daily,
regimented feedings, and periodic blood measurements using the same home-testing
glucose monitors used by human patients. And if the purified pig insulin
commonly used for dogs fails to work for a particular dog, the vet may even turn
to a formulation of human insulin, bringing the process full circle. After all that dogs have done
for us throughout the ages, including their role
in a medical discovery that has saved countless human lives, using that same knowledge
to help them is the least we could do.

his portion with Charles Best, for his help in the initial
studies involving dogs. But while medical experimentation
on animals remains controversial, in this case at least, it was not just a matter
of exploiting dogs for human needs. Dogs develop diabetes at the rate
of two cases per 1,000 dogs, almost the same
as that of humans under 20. Most canine cases are of Type 1 diabetes, similar to the type
that young children develop following immune system
destruction of the pancreas, and genetic studies have shown that the dog disease has many
similar hallmarks of the human disease. This has allowed veterinarians
to turn the tables, successfully using insulin
to treat diabetes in man's best friend for over 60 years. Many dog owners commit
to managing their dogs' diabetes with insulin injected twice daily,
regimented feedings, and periodic blood measurements using the same home-testing
glucose monitors used by human patients. And if the purified pig insulin
commonly used for dogs fails to work for a particular dog, the vet may even turn
to a formulation of human insulin, bringing the process full circle. After all that dogs have done
for us throughout the ages, including their role
in a medical discovery that has saved countless human lives, using that same knowledge
to help them is the least we could do.

**Question 4: According to the transcript, what was the outcome of the research conducted by Frederick Banting and his student, Charles Best?**

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that directly asks about the organ removed from dogs to recreate the signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus.

Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that the closest match would be a question that mentions the pancreas and its relation to diabetes research.

If I had to choose from the provided options, I would say that **Question 4** is the closest match, but it's not a direct match.

A more suitable match would be a question like:

"What organ did Von Mering and Minkowski remove from dogs to demonstrate its central role in diabetes?"

Unfortunately, this question is not among the provided generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
Diabetes mellitus has been a scourge
of the developed world with an estimated 400,000,000 people
worldwide suffering from this disease, and 50% more predicted
within twenty years. Its early symptoms, which include increased thirst
and large volumes of urine, were recognized as far back
as 1500 BCE in Egypt. While the term diabetes,
meaning "to pass through," was first used in 250 BCE by the Greek physician
Apollonius of Memphis, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, associated respectively
with youth and obesity, were identified as separate conditions by Indian physicians
somewhere in the 5th century CE. But despite the disease being known, a diagnosis of diabetes in a human patient would remain tantamount
to a death sentence until the early 20th century,
its causes unknown. What changed this dire situation was the help of humanity's
longtime animal partner: Canis lupus familiaris, domesticated from Grey wolves
thousands of years ago. In 1890, the German scientists
Von Mering and Minkowski demonstrated that removing
a dog's pancreas caused it to develop
all the signs of diabetes, thus establishing the organ's
central role in the disease. But the exact mechanism
by which this occurred remained a mystery until 1920, when a young Canadian surgeon
named Frederick Banting and his student, Charles Best, advanced the findings
of their German colleagues. Working under Professor Macleod
at the University of Toronto, they confirmed that the pancreas was
responsible for regulating blood glucose, successfully treating diabetic dogs
by injecting them with an extract they had prepared from pancreas tissue. By 1922, the researchers working
with biochemist James Collip were able to develop a similar extract
from beef pancreas to first treat a 14-year-old diabetic boy, followed by six additional patients. The manufacturing process
for this extract, now known as insulin, was eventually turned over
to a pharmaceutical company that makes different types
of injectable insulin to this day. Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize for Medicine
in 1923 for their discovery. But Banting chose to share

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can suggest a related generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about treating diabetic dogs with a specific type of insulin when pig insulin is not effective. While there isn't a direct match, generated MCQ 9 discusses the role of veterinarians in treating diabetes in dogs using insulin.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that specifically mentions using an alternative type of insulin (e.g., human insulin) when the primary type (e.g., pig insulin) is ineffective. Unfortunately, such a generated MCQ is not present in the provided options.

Given the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, if I had to choose one based on the topic of treating canine diabetes with insulin, I would select generated MCQ 9, despite it not being a direct match.

**Transcript**:
They call me the tornado chaser. When the wind is up 
and conditions are right, I get in my car and follow violent storms. "Crazy," you say? Perhaps, but really I
chase these sky beasts to learn about them. I want to share with you what I know. Tornadoes are rapidly rotating columns
of air that form inside storms that connect with the ground via
a funnel of cloud. When that happens, 
they tear across the Earth, posing a huge threat to life and property. Because of this, there's a great deal
of research into these phenomena, but the truth is, there's still a lot
we don't know about how tornadoes form. The conditions that may 
give rise to one tornado won't necessarily cause another. But we have learned a lot since
people first started recording tornadoes, like how to recognize the signs
when one is brewing in the sky. Are you coming along for the ride? Tornadoes begin with a thunderstorm
but not just any thunderstorm. These are especially powerful, towering
thunderstorms called supercells. Reaching up to over 50,000 feet,
they bring high force winds, giant hailstones, sometimes flooding
and great flashes of lightning, too. These are the kinds of storms
that breed tornadoes, but only if there are also very
specific conditions in place, clues that we can measure and look out for
when we're trying to forecast a storm. Rising air is the first ingredient needed
for a tornado to develop. Any storm is formed 
when condensation occurs, the byproducts of the clouds. Condensation releases heat, and heat becomes the energy that drives
huge upward drafts of air. The more condensation
and the bigger the storm clouds grow, the more powerful those updrafts become. In supercells, this rising airmass 
is particularly strong. As the air climbs, it can change direction
and start to move more quickly. Finally, at the storm's base,
if there is a lot of moisture, a huge cloud base develops,
giving the tornado something to feed off later,
if it gets that far. When all these things are in place,
a vortex can develop enclosed by the storm, and forming a wide, tall tube of spinning
air that then gets pulled upwards. We call this a mesocyclone. Outside, cool, dry, sinking air starts to wrap around the back of
this mesocyclone, forming what's known as a
rear flank downdraft. This unusual scenario creates 
a stark temperature difference between the air inside the mesocyclone,
and the air outside, building up a level of instability
that allows a tornado to thrive. Then, the mesocyclone's lower part
becomes tighter, increasing the speed of the wind. If, and that's a big if,
this funnel of air moves down into that large, moist cloud base
at the bottom of the parent storm, it sucks it in and turns it 
into a rotating wall of cloud, forming a link between 
the storm that created it and the Earth. The second that tube of
spinning cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado. Most are small and short-lived,
producing winds of 65-110 miles per hour, but others can last for over an hour,
producing 200 mile per hour winds. They are beautiful but terrifying, especially if you or 
your town is in its path. In that case, no one,
not even tornado chasers like me, enjoy watching thing unfold. Just like everything, however,
tornadoes do come to an end. When the temperature difference disappears
and conditions grow more stable, or the moisture in the air dries up, the once fierce parent storm loses
momentum and draws its tornado back inside. Even so, meteorologists and storm chasers
like me will remain on the lookout, watching, always watching to see
if the storm releases its long rope again.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 8 does not match the ground truth MCQ exactly, I re-examined the generated MCQs and found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the common effects of supercells, whereas the generated MCQs focus on different aspects of tornadoes.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of supercells, I would choose Question 1, but it's not a good match because it asks about the definition of a tornado, not the effects of supercells.

A better approach would be to generate a new MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ. Here's an example:

Question: What do supercells commonly bring?
Options: A. High force winds, B. Hailstones and lightning, C. Flooding, D. All of the above
Correct Option: D

Since this is not among the generated MCQs, I will not provide an index. However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that there is no good match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of content.

give rise to one tornado won't necessarily cause another. But we have learned a lot since
people first started recording tornadoes, like how to recognize the signs
when one is brewing in the sky. Are you coming along for the ride? Tornadoes begin with a thunderstorm
but not just any thunderstorm. These are especially powerful, towering
thunderstorms called supercells. Reaching up to over 50,000 feet,
they bring high force winds, giant hailstones, sometimes flooding
and great flashes of lightning, too. These are the kinds of storms
that breed tornadoes, but only if there are also very
specific conditions in place, clues that we can measure and look out for
when we're trying to forecast a storm. Rising air is the first ingredient needed
for a tornado to develop. Any storm is formed 
when condensation occurs, the byproducts of the clouds. Condensation releases heat, and heat becomes the energy that drives
huge upward drafts of air. The more condensation
and the bigger the storm clouds grow, the more powerful those updrafts become. In supercells, this rising airmass 
is particularly strong. As the air climbs, it can change direction
and start to move more quickly. Finally, at the storm's base,
if there is a lot of moisture, a huge cloud base develops,
giving the tornado something to feed off later,
if it gets that far. When all these things are in place,
a vortex can develop enclosed by the storm, and forming a wide, tall tube of spinning
air that then gets pulled upwards. We call this a mesocyclone. Outside, cool, dry, sinking air starts to wrap around the back of
this mesocyclone, forming what's known as a
rear flank downdraft. This unusual scenario creates 
a stark temperature difference between the air inside the mesocyclone,
and the air outside, building up a level of instability
that allows a tornado to thrive. Then, the mesocyclone's lower part
becomes tighter, increasing the speed of the wind. If, and that's a big if,
this funnel of air moves down into that large, moist cloud base
at the bottom of the parent storm, it sucks it in and turns it 
into a rotating wall of cloud, forming a link between 
the storm that created it and the Earth. The second that tube of
spinning cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado. Most are small and short-lived,
producing winds of 65-110 miles per hour, but others can last for over an hour,
producing 200 mile per hour winds. They are beautiful but terrifying, especially if you or 
your town is in its path. In that case, no one,
not even tornado chasers like me, enjoy watching thing unfold. Just like everything, however,
tornadoes do come to an end. When the temperature difference disappears
and conditions grow more stable, or the moisture in the air dries up, the once fierce parent storm loses
momentum and draws its tornado back inside. Even so, meteorologists and storm chasers
like me will remain on the lookout, watching, always watching to see
if the storm releases its long rope again.

They call me the tornado chaser. When the wind is up 
and conditions are right, I get in my car and follow violent storms. "Crazy," you say? Perhaps, but really I
chase these sky beasts to learn about them. I want to share with you what I know. Tornadoes are rapidly rotating columns
of air that form inside storms that connect with the ground via
a funnel of cloud. When that happens,

**Transcript**:
How do you know you're real? It's an obvious question
until you try to answer it, but let's take it seriously. How do you really know you exist? In his "Meditations on First Philosophy," René Descartes tried to answer
that very question, demolishing all his preconceived
notions and opinions to begin again from the foundations. All his knowledge had come
from his sensory perceptions of the world. Same as you, right? You know you're watching this video
with your eyes, hearing it with your ears. Your senses show you the world as it is. They aren't deceiving you,
but sometimes they do. You might mistake a person
far away for someone else, or you're sure you're about
to catch a flyball, and it hits the ground in front of you. But come on, right here and now, you know what's right
in front of you is real. Your eyes, your hands,
your body: that's you. Only crazy people would deny that,
and you know you're not crazy. Anyone who'd doubt that must be dreaming. Oh no, what if you're dreaming? Dreams feel real. You can believe you're swimming, flying or fighting off monsters
with your bare hands, when your real body is lying in bed. No, no, no. When you're awake, you know you're awake. Ah! But when you aren't,
you don't know you aren't, so you can't prove you aren't dreaming. Maybe the body you perceive
yourself to have isn't really there. Maybe all of reality,
even its abstract concepts, like time, shape, color
and number are false, all just deceptions concocted by an evil genius! No, seriously. Descartes asks if you can disprove
the idea that an evil genius demon has tricked you into
believing reality is real. Perhaps this diabolical
deceiver has duped you. The world, your perceptions
of it, your very body. You can't disprove
that they're all just made up, and how could you exist without them? You couldn't! So, you don't. Life is but a dream, and I bet you aren't row, row,
rowing the boat merrily at all, are you? No, you're rowing it wearily like the duped, nonexistent
doof you are/aren't. Do you find that convincing? Are you persuaded? If you aren't, good;
if you are, even better, because by being persuaded, you would prove
that you're a persuaded being. You can't be nothing
if you think you're something, even if you think
that something is nothing because no matter what you think,
you're a thinking thing, or as Descartes put it,
"I think, therefore I am," and so are you, really. (Airplane engine)

**Transcript**:
How do you know you're real? It's an obvious question
until you try to answer it, but let's take it seriously. How do you really know you exist? In his "Meditations on First Philosophy," René Descartes tried to answer
that very question, demolishing all his preconceived
notions and opinions to begin again from the foundations. All his knowledge had come
from his sensory perceptions of the world. Same as you, right? You know you're watching this video
with your eyes, hearing it with your ears. Your senses show you the world as it is. They aren't deceiving you,
but sometimes they do. You might mistake a person
far away for someone else, or you're sure you're about
to catch a flyball, and it hits the ground in front of you. But come on, right here and now, you know what's right
in front of you is real. Your eyes, your hands,
your body: that's you. Only crazy people would deny that,
and you know you're not crazy. Anyone who'd doubt that must be dreaming. Oh no, what if you're dreaming? Dreams feel real. You can believe you're swimming, flying or fighting off monsters
with your bare hands, when your real body is lying in bed. No, no, no. When you're awake, you know you're awake. Ah! But when you aren't,
you don't know you aren't, so you can't prove you aren't dreaming. Maybe the body you perceive
yourself to have isn't really there. Maybe all of reality,
even its abstract concepts, like time, shape, color
and number are false, all just deceptions concocted by an evil genius! No, seriously. Descartes asks if you can disprove
the idea that an evil genius demon has tricked you into
believing reality is real. Perhaps this diabolical
deceiver has duped you. The world, your perceptions
of it, your very body. You can't disprove
that they're all just made up, and how could you exist without them? You couldn't! So, you don't. Life is but a dream, and I bet you aren't row, row,
rowing the boat merrily at all, are you? No, you're rowing it wearily like the duped, nonexistent
doof you are/aren't. Do you find that convincing? Are you persuaded? If you aren't, good;
if you are, even better, because by being persuaded, you would prove
that you're a persuaded being. You can't be nothing
if you think you're something, even if you think
that something is nothing because no matter what you think,
you're a thinking thing, or as Descartes put it,
"I think, therefore I am," and so are you, really. (Airplane engine)

**Transcript**:
What if I told you there were trillions
of tiny bacteria all around you? It's true. Microorganisms called bacteria
were some of the first life forms to appear on Earth. Though they consist of only a single cell, their total biomass is greater than
that of all plants and animals combined. And they live virtually everywhere: on the ground, in the water, on your kitchen table, on your skin, even inside you. Don't reach for the panic button just yet. Although you have 10 times
more bacterial cells inside you than your body has human cells, many of these bacteria
are harmless or even beneficial, helping digestion and immunity. But there are a few bad apples
that can cause harmful infections, from minor inconveniences
to deadly epidemics. Fortunately, there are amazing medicines
designed to fight bacterial infections. Synthesized from chemicals or
occurring naturally in things like mold, these antibiotics kill
or neutralize bacteria by interrupting cell wall synthesis or interfering with vital processes
like protein synthesis, all while leaving human cells unharmed. The deployment of antibiotics
over the course of the 20th century has rendered many previously
dangerous diseases easily treatable. But today, more and more
of our antibiotics are becoming less effective. Did something go wrong
to make them stop working? The problem is not with the antibiotics
but the bacteria they were made to fight, and the reason lies in Darwin's theory
of natural selection. Just like any other organisms, individual bacteria
can undergo random mutations. Many of these mutations
are harmful or useless, but every now and then,
one comes along that gives its organism an edge in survival. And for a bacterium, a mutation making it resistant
to a certain antibiotic gives quite the edge. As the non-resistant bacteria
are killed off, which happens especially quickly
in antibiotic-rich environments, like hospitals, there is more room and resources
for the resistant ones to thrive, passing along only the mutated genes
that help them do so. Reproduction
isn't the only way to do this. Some can release their DNA upon death
to be picked up by other bacteria, while others use a method
called conjugation, connecting through pili
to share their genes. Over time, the resistant
genes proliferate, creating entire strains
of resistant super bacteria. So how much time do we have
before these superbugs take over? Well, in some bacteria,
it's already happened. For instance, some strands
of staphylococcus aureus, which causes everything from
skin infections to pneumonia and sepsis, have developed into MRSA, becoming resistant
to beta-lactam antibiotics, like penicillin, methicillin,
and oxacillin. Thanks to a gene that replaces the protein
beta-lactams normally target and bind to, MRSA can keep making
its cell walls unimpeded. Other super bacteria, like salmonella, even sometimes produce enzymes
like beta-lactams that break down antibiotic attackers
before they can do any damage, and E. coli, a diverse group of bacteria that contains strains that cause
diarrhea and kidney failure, can prevent the function of antibiotics, like quinolones, by actively
booting any invaders that manage to enter the cell. But there is good news. Scientists are working to stay
one step ahead of the bacteria, and although development
of new antibiotics has slowed in recent years, the World Health Organization has made it
a priority to develop novel treatments. Other scientists are investigating
alternate solutions, such as phage therapy
or using vaccines to prevent infections. Most importantly, curbing the excessive
and unnecessary use of antibiotics, such as for minor infections
that can resolve on their own, as well as changing medical practice
to prevent hospital infections, can have a major impact by keeping more
non-resistant bacteria alive as competition for resistant strains. In the war against super bacteria,
deescalation may sometimes work better than an evolutionary arms race.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a method by which antibiotics attempt to kill bacteria, and the correct option is "Forming a membrane around the cell" as the incorrect method.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 2, which asks about the primary reason for the increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the mechanisms of antibiotic action or resistance. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 7, which asks about the name of the enzyme that makes MRSA resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. This question is related to the mechanism of antibiotic resistance, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, but Question 7 is the most relevant one.

**Transcript**:
What if I told you there were trillions
of tiny bacteria all around you? It's true. Microorganisms called bacteria
were some of the first life forms to appear on Earth. Though they consist of only a single cell, their total biomass is greater than
that of all plants and animals combined. And they live virtually everywhere: on the ground, in the water, on your kitchen table, on your skin, even inside you. Don't reach for the panic button just yet. Although you have 10 times
more bacterial cells inside you than your body has human cells, many of these bacteria
are harmless or even beneficial, helping digestion and immunity. But there are a few bad apples
that can cause harmful infections, from minor inconveniences
to deadly epidemics. Fortunately, there are amazing medicines
designed to fight bacterial infections. Synthesized from chemicals or
occurring naturally in things like mold, these antibiotics kill
or neutralize bacteria by interrupting cell wall synthesis or interfering with vital processes
like protein synthesis, all while leaving human cells unharmed. The deployment of antibiotics
over the course of the 20th century has rendered many previously
dangerous diseases easily treatable. But today, more and more
of our antibiotics are becoming less effective. Did something go wrong
to make them stop working? The problem is not with the antibiotics
but the bacteria they were made to fight, and the reason lies in Darwin's theory
of natural selection. Just like any other organisms, individual bacteria
can undergo random mutations. Many of these mutations
are harmful or useless, but every now and then,
one comes along that gives its organism an edge in survival. And for a bacterium, a mutation making it resistant
to a certain antibiotic gives quite the edge. As the non-resistant bacteria
are killed off, which happens especially quickly
in antibiotic-rich environments, like hospitals, there is more room and resources
for the resistant ones to thrive, passing along only the mutated genes
that help them do so. Reproduction
isn't the only way to do this. Some can release their DNA upon death
to be picked up by other bacteria, while others use a method
called conjugation, connecting through pili
to share their genes. Over time, the resistant
genes proliferate, creating entire strains
of resistant super bacteria. So how much time do we have
before these superbugs take over? Well, in some bacteria,
it's already happened. For instance, some strands
of staphylococcus aureus, which causes everything from
skin infections to pneumonia and sepsis, have developed into MRSA, becoming resistant
to beta-lactam antibiotics, like penicillin, methicillin,
and oxacillin. Thanks to a gene that replaces the protein
beta-lactams normally target and bind to, MRSA can keep making
its cell walls unimpeded. Other super bacteria, like salmonella, even sometimes produce enzymes
like beta-lactams that break down antibiotic attackers
before they can do any damage, and E. coli, a diverse group of bacteria that contains strains that cause
diarrhea and kidney failure, can prevent the function of antibiotics, like quinolones, by actively
booting any invaders that manage to enter the cell. But there is good news. Scientists are working to stay
one step ahead of the bacteria, and although development
of new antibiotics has slowed in recent years, the World Health Organization has made it
a priority to develop novel treatments. Other scientists are investigating
alternate solutions, such as phage therapy
or using vaccines to prevent infections. Most importantly, curbing the excessive
and unnecessary use of antibiotics, such as for minor infections
that can resolve on their own, as well as changing medical practice
to prevent hospital infections, can have a major impact by keeping more
non-resistant bacteria alive as competition for resistant strains. In the war against super bacteria,
deescalation may sometimes work better than an evolutionary arms race.

**Transcript**:
How and when did our universe begin? How did it get to look like this? How will it end? Humans have been discussing these questions for as long as they've been around
without ever reaching much agreement. Today, cosmologists are working hard
to find the answers. But how can anyone hope to find
concrete answers to such profound questions? And how is it possible to explore and study
something as huge as the universe, most of which we'll never be able to reach? The answer is light. And although light from
distant parts of the universe can take billions of years to reach us, it carries six unique messages
that, when put together, can disclose an amazing amount
of information to astronomers who know how to look for it. Just as sunlight can be split up
into the familiar rainbow, splitting the light from distant objects
exposes different patterns of colors depending on its source. This distinctive light barcode
can reveal not only an object's composition, but also the temperature and pressure
of its constituent parts. There's even more we can
discover from light. If you've ever stood on a train platform,
you might have noticed that the train sounds different 
depending on its direction with the pitch ascending 
when it approaches you and descending when it speeds away. But this isn't because the train conductor
is practicing for a second career. Rather, it's because of something
called the Doppler effect where sound waves generated by
an approaching object are compressed, while those from a receding
object are stretched. But what has this to do with astronomy? Sound does not travel through a vacuum.
In space, no one can you hear you scream! But the same Doppler effect applies to light
whose source is moving at exceptional speed. If it's moving towards us, 
the shorter wavelength will make the light appear to be bluer. While light from a source
that's moving away will have a longer wavelength,
shifting towards red. So by analyzing the color pattern
in the Doppler shift of the light from any object observed with a telescope,
we can learn what it's made of, how hot it is and 
how much pressure it's under, as well as whether it's moving, 
in what direction and how fast. And these six measurements,
like six points of light, reveal the history of the universe. The first person to study the light 
from distant galaxies was Edwin Hubble, and the light he observed was redshifted. The distant galaxies were 
all moving away from us, and the further away the were,
the faster they were receding. Hubble had discovered
our universe is expanding, providing the first evidence
for the Big Bang theory. Along with the idea that the visible universe
has been constantly expanding from a densely packed single point, one of this theory's 
most important predictions is that the early universe consisted
of just two gases: hydrogen and helium, in a ratio of three to one. And this prediction can
also be tested with light. If we observe the light from a remote,
quiet region of the universe and split it, we do indeed find the signatures
of the two gases in just those proportions. Another triumph for the Big Bang. However, many puzzles remain. Although we know the
visible universe is expanding, gravity should be applying the brakes. But recent measurements of light
from distant dying stars show us that they're farther away
than predicted. So the expansion of the universe
is actually accelerating. Something appears to be pushing it, and many scientists believe
that something is dark energy, making up over 2/3 of the universe
and slowly tearing it apart. Our knowledge of the behavior of matter
and the precision of our instruments means that simply observing distant stars
can tell us more about the universe than we ever thought possible. But there are other mysteries,
like the nature of dark energy upon which we have yet to shed light.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: What is the unique property of light that allows astronomers to study the universe?**

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that this question doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that specifically asks about the number of pieces of information carried by light.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the number of pieces of information carried by light. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the content and intent of the questions.

**Question 4: What can astronomers learn from analyzing the color pattern in the Doppler shift of light from an object?**

This question is related to the information carried by light, and the correct option (D) mentions that astronomers can learn about the composition, temperature, direction, speed, and more. Although it doesn't explicitly state the number of pieces of information, it implies that there are multiple pieces of information that can be gathered from light.

Given the available options, I would suggest that **Question 4** is the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ, although it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
How and when did our universe begin? How did it get to look like this? How will it end? Humans have been discussing these questions for as long as they've been around
without ever reaching much agreement. Today, cosmologists are working hard
to find the answers. But how can anyone hope to find
concrete answers to such profound questions? And how is it possible to explore and study
something as huge as the universe, most of which we'll never be able to reach? The answer is light. And although light from
distant parts of the universe can take billions of years to reach us, it carries six unique messages
that, when put together, can disclose an amazing amount
of information to astronomers who know how to look for it. Just as sunlight can be split up
into the familiar rainbow, splitting the light from distant objects
exposes different patterns of colors depending on its source. This distinctive light barcode
can reveal not only an object's composition, but also the temperature and pressure
of its constituent parts. There's even more we can
discover from light. If you've ever stood on a train platform,
you might have noticed that the train sounds different 
depending on its direction with the pitch ascending 
when it approaches you and descending when it speeds away. But this isn't because the train conductor
is practicing for a second career. Rather, it's because of something
called the Doppler effect where sound waves generated by
an approaching object are compressed, while those from a receding
object are stretched. But what has this to do with astronomy? Sound does not travel through a vacuum.
In space, no one can you hear you scream! But the same Doppler effect applies to light
whose source is moving at exceptional speed. If it's moving towards us, 
the shorter wavelength will make the light appear to be bluer. While light from a source
that's moving away will have a longer wavelength,
shifting towards red. So by analyzing the color pattern
in the Doppler shift of the light from any object observed with a telescope,
we can learn what it's made of, how hot it is and 
how much pressure it's under, as well as whether it's moving, 
in what direction and how fast. And these six measurements,
like six points of light, reveal the history of the universe. The first person to study the light 
from distant galaxies was Edwin Hubble, and the light he observed was redshifted. The distant galaxies were 
all moving away from us, and the further away the were,
the faster they were receding. Hubble had discovered
our universe is expanding, providing the first evidence
for the Big Bang theory. Along with the idea that the visible universe
has been constantly expanding from a densely packed single point, one of this theory's 
most important predictions is that the early universe consisted
of just two gases: hydrogen and helium, in a ratio of three to one. And this prediction can
also be tested with light. If we observe the light from a remote,
quiet region of the universe and split it, we do indeed find the signatures
of the two gases in just those proportions. Another triumph for the Big Bang. However, many puzzles remain. Although we know the
visible universe is expanding, gravity should be applying the brakes. But recent measurements of light
from distant dying stars show us that they're farther away
than predicted. So the expansion of the universe
is actually accelerating. Something appears to be pushing it, and many scientists believe
that something is dark energy, making up over 2/3 of the universe
and slowly tearing it apart. Our knowledge of the behavior of matter
and the precision of our instruments means that simply observing distant stars
can tell us more about the universe than we ever thought possible. But there are other mysteries,
like the nature of dark energy upon which we have yet to shed light.

**Transcript**:
You've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth, but how does it work? Is it like the glass of a greenhouse or like an insulating blanket? Well, not entirely. The answer involves a bit of quantum mechanics, but don't worry, we'll start with a rainbow. If you look closely at sunlight separated through a prism, you'll see dark gaps where bands of color went missing. Where did they go? Before reaching our eyes, different gases absorbed those specific parts of the spectrum. For example, oxygen gas snatched up some of the dark red light, and sodium grabbed two bands of yellow. But why do these gases absorb specific colors of light? This is where we enter the quantum realm. Every atom and molecule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electrons. To shift its electrons from the ground state to a higher level, a molecule needs to gain a certain amount of energy. No more, no less. It gets that energy from light, which comes in more energy levels than you could count. Light consists of tiny particles called photons and the amount of energy in each photon corresponds to its color. Red light has lower energy and longer wavelengths. Purple light has higher energy and shorter wavelengths. Sunlight offers all the photons of the rainbow, so a gas molecule can choose the photons that carry the exact amount of energy needed to shift the molecule to its next energy level. When this match is made, the photon disappers as the molecule gains its energy, and we get a small gap in our rainbow. If a photon carries too much or too little energy, the molecule has no choice but to let it fly past. This is why glass is transparent. The atoms in glass do not pair well with any of the energy levels in visible light, so the photons pass through. So, which photons does carbon dioxide prefer? Where is the black line in our rainbow that explains global warming? Well, it's not there. Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb light directly from the Sun. It absorbs light from a totally different celestial body. One that doesn't appear to be emitting light at all: Earth. If you're wondering why our planet doesn't seem to be glowing, it's because the Earth doesn't emit visible light. It emits infared light. The light that our eyes can see, including all of the colors of the rainbow, is just a small part of the larger spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays. It may seem strange to think of these things as light, but there is no fundamental difference between visible light and other electromagnetic radiation. It's the same energy, but at a higher or lower level. In fact, it's a bit presumptuous to define the term visible light by our own limitations. After all, infrared light is visible to snakes, and ultraviolet light is visible to birds. If our eyes were adapted to see light of 1900 megahertz, then a mobile phone would be a flashlight, and a cell phone tower would look like a huge lantern. Earth emits infrared radiation because every object with a temperature above absolute zero will emit light. This is called thermal radiation. The hotter an object gets, the higher frequency the light it emits. When you heat a piece of iron, it will emit more and more frequencies of infrared light, and then, at a temperature of around 450 degrees Celsius, its light will reach the visible spectrum. At first, it will look red hot. And with even more heat, it will glow white with all of the frequencies of visible light. This is how traditional light bulbs were designed to work and why they're so wasteful. 95% of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes. It's wasted as heat. Earth's infrared radiation would escape to space if there weren't greenhouse gas molecules in our atmophere. Just as oxygen gas prefers the dark red photons, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases match with infrared photons. They provide the right amount of energy to shift the gas molecules into their higher energy level. Shortly after a carbon dioxide molecule absorbs an infrared photon, it will fall back to its previous energy level, and spit a photon back out in a random direction. Some of that energy then returns to Earth's surface, causing warming. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more likely that infrared photons will land back on Earth and change our climate.

**Transcript**:
You've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth, but how does it work? Is it like the glass of a greenhouse or like an insulating blanket? Well, not entirely. The answer involves a bit of quantum mechanics, but don't worry, we'll start with a rainbow. If you look closely at sunlight separated through a prism, you'll see dark gaps where bands of color went missing. Where did they go? Before reaching our eyes, different gases absorbed those specific parts of the spectrum. For example, oxygen gas snatched up some of the dark red light, and sodium grabbed two bands of yellow. But why do these gases absorb specific colors of light? This is where we enter the quantum realm. Every atom and molecule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electrons. To shift its electrons from the ground state to a higher level, a molecule needs to gain a certain amount of energy. No more, no less. It gets that energy from light, which comes in more energy levels than you could count. Light consists of tiny particles called photons and the amount of energy in each photon corresponds to its color. Red light has lower energy and longer wavelengths. Purple light has higher energy and shorter wavelengths. Sunlight offers all the photons of the rainbow, so a gas molecule can choose the photons that carry the exact amount of energy needed to shift the molecule to its next energy level. When this match is made, the photon disappers as the molecule gains its energy, and we get a small gap in our rainbow. If a photon carries too much or too little energy, the molecule has no choice but to let it fly past. This is why glass is transparent. The atoms in glass do not pair well with any of the energy levels in visible light, so the photons pass through. So, which photons does carbon dioxide prefer? Where is the black line in our rainbow that explains global warming? Well, it's not there. Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb light directly from the Sun. It absorbs light from a totally different celestial body. One that doesn't appear to be emitting light at all: Earth. If you're wondering why our planet doesn't seem to be glowing, it's because the Earth doesn't emit visible light. It emits infared light. The light that our eyes can see, including all of the colors of the rainbow, is just a small part of the larger spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays. It may seem strange to think of these things as light, but there is no fundamental difference between visible light and other electromagnetic radiation. It's the same energy, but at a higher or lower level. In fact, it's a bit presumptuous to define the term visible light by our own limitations. After all, infrared light is visible to snakes, and ultraviolet light is visible to birds. If our eyes were adapted to see light of 1900 megahertz, then a mobile phone would be a flashlight, and a cell phone tower would look like a huge lantern. Earth emits infrared radiation because every object with a temperature above absolute zero will emit light. This is called thermal radiation. The hotter an object gets, the higher frequency the light it emits. When you heat a piece of iron, it will emit more and more frequencies of infrared light, and then, at a temperature of around 450 degrees Celsius, its light will reach the visible spectrum. At first, it will look red hot. And with even more heat, it will glow white with all of the frequencies of visible light. This is how traditional light bulbs were designed to work and why they're so wasteful. 95% of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes. It's wasted as heat. Earth's infrared radiation would escape to space if there weren't greenhouse gas molecules in our atmophere. Just as oxygen gas prefers the dark red photons, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases match with infrared photons. They provide the right amount of energy to shift the gas molecules into their higher energy level. Shortly after a carbon dioxide molecule absorbs an infrared photon, it will fall back to its previous energy level, and spit a photon back out in a random direction. Some of that energy then returns to Earth's surface, causing warming. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more likely that infrared photons will land back on Earth and change our climate.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ is about the energy levels of atoms and molecules. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about energy levels, Question 6 discusses the relationship between temperature and the frequency of light emitted, which is related to energy levels.

However, a closer match is not available. If I had to choose, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar, as it discusses the fundamental nature of electromagnetic radiation and energy, but it is still not a direct match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: **9**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the concept of energy levels in atoms and molecules.

At first, it will look red hot. And with even more heat, it will glow white with all of the frequencies of visible light. This is how traditional light bulbs were designed to work and why they're so wasteful. 95% of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes. It's wasted as heat. Earth's infrared radiation would escape to space if there weren't greenhouse gas molecules in our atmophere. Just as oxygen gas prefers the dark red photons, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases match with infrared photons. They provide the right amount of energy to shift the gas molecules into their higher energy level. Shortly after a carbon dioxide molecule absorbs an infrared photon, it will fall back to its previous energy level, and spit a photon back out in a random direction. Some of that energy then returns to Earth's surface, causing warming. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more likely that infrared photons will land back on Earth and change our climate.

**Transcript**:
When we think of classic works of art, the most common setting we imagine them in is a museum. But what we often forget is that much of this art was not produced with a museum setting in mind. What happens to an artwork when it's taken out of its originally intended context? Take the example of Michelangelo's Statue of David, depicting the boy hero who slew the giant philistine, Goliath, armed with only his courage and his slingshot. When Michelangelo began carving a block of pure white marble to communicate this famous Biblical story, the city of Florence intended to place the finished product atop their grand cathedral. Not only would the 17 foot tall statue be easily visible at this height, but its placement alongside 11 other statues of Old Testament heroes towering over onlookers would have a powerful religious significance, forcing the viewer to stare in awe towards the heavens. But by the time Michelangelo had finished the work, in 1504, the plans for the other statues had fallen through, and the city realized that lifting such a large sculpture to the roof would be more difficult than they had thought. Furthermore, the statue was so detailed and lifelike, down to the bulging veins in David's arm and the determination on his face, that it seemed a shame to hide it so far from the viewer. A council of politicians and artists convened to decide on a new location for the statue. Ultimately voting to place it in front of the Palazzo della Signoria, the town hall and home of the new Republican government. This new location transformed the statue's meaning. The Medici family, who for generations had ruled the city through their control of banking, had recently been exiled, and Florence now saw itself as a free city, threatened on all sides by wealthy and powerful rivals. David, now the symbol of heroic resistance against overwhelming odds, was placed with his intense stare, now a look of stern warning, focused directly towards Rome, the home of Cardinal Giovanni de Medici. Though the statue itself had not been altered, its placement changed nearly every aspect of it from a religious to a political significance. Though a replica of David still appears at the Palazzo, the original statue was moved in 1873 to the Galleria dell'Accademia, where it remains today. In the orderly, quiet environment of the museum, alongside numerous half-finished Michelangelo sculptures, overt religious and political interpretations fall away, giving way to detached contemplation of Michelangelo's artistic and technical skill. But even here, the astute viewer may notice that David's head and hand appear disproportionately large, a reminder that they were made to be viewed from below. So, not only does context change the meaning and interpretation of an artwork throughout its history, sometimes it can make that history resurface in the most unexpected ways.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list.

However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 4 is the closest. It talks about the change in meaning of the Statue of David, which is related to the biblical story of David vs. Goliath.

But if I'm being completely honest, none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: Question 4 (but with a big caveat that it's not a great match).

Though the statue itself had not been altered, its placement changed nearly every aspect of it from a religious to a political significance. Though a replica of David still appears at the Palazzo, the original statue was moved in 1873 to the Galleria dell'Accademia, where it remains today. In the orderly, quiet environment of the museum, alongside numerous half-finished Michelangelo sculptures, overt religious and political interpretations fall away, giving way to detached contemplation of Michelangelo's artistic and technical skill. But even here, the astute viewer may notice that David's head and hand appear disproportionately large, a reminder that they were made to be viewed from below. So, not only does context change the meaning and interpretation of an artwork throughout its history, sometimes it can make that history resurface in the most unexpected ways.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the direction in which Michelangelo's Statue of David faces. 

Question: Towards which city does Michelangelo’s Statue of David face?
Options: A. Venice, B. Milan, C. Rome, D. Paris
Correct Option: C

The most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7 provides some information about the context that can be used to infer the direction the statue faces.

However, a more relevant question is Question 4, which mentions that the statue was placed with its intense stare focused directly towards Rome.

So, while there isn't a perfect match, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4.

However, it's worth noting that Question 4 is not asking the same thing as the ground truth MCQ. It's asking about the change in meaning of the statue when it was moved to the Palazzo della Signoria.

A more accurate answer would be that there isn't a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 4 is the closest.

**Transcript**:
When we think of classic works of art, the most common setting we imagine them in is a museum. But what we often forget is that much of this art was not produced with a museum setting in mind. What happens to an artwork when it's taken out of its originally intended context? Take the example of Michelangelo's Statue of David, depicting the boy hero who slew the giant philistine, Goliath, armed with only his courage and his slingshot. When Michelangelo began carving a block of pure white marble to communicate this famous Biblical story, the city of Florence intended to place the finished product atop their grand cathedral. Not only would the 17 foot tall statue be easily visible at this height, but its placement alongside 11 other statues of Old Testament heroes towering over onlookers would have a powerful religious significance, forcing the viewer to stare in awe towards the heavens. But by the time Michelangelo had finished the work, in 1504, the plans for the other statues had fallen through, and the city realized that lifting such a large sculpture to the roof would be more difficult than they had thought. Furthermore, the statue was so detailed and lifelike, down to the bulging veins in David's arm and the determination on his face, that it seemed a shame to hide it so far from the viewer. A council of politicians and artists convened to decide on a new location for the statue. Ultimately voting to place it in front of the Palazzo della Signoria, the town hall and home of the new Republican government. This new location transformed the statue's meaning. The Medici family, who for generations had ruled the city through their control of banking, had recently been exiled, and Florence now saw itself as a free city, threatened on all sides by wealthy and powerful rivals. David, now the symbol of heroic resistance against overwhelming odds, was placed with his intense stare, now a look of stern warning, focused directly towards Rome, the home of Cardinal Giovanni de Medici. Though the statue itself had not been altered, its placement changed nearly every aspect of it from a religious to a political significance. Though a replica of David still appears at the Palazzo, the original statue was moved in 1873 to the Galleria dell'Accademia, where it remains today. In the orderly, quiet environment of the museum, alongside numerous half-finished Michelangelo sculptures, overt religious and political interpretations fall away, giving way to detached contemplation of Michelangelo's artistic and technical skill. But even here, the astute viewer may notice that David's head and hand appear disproportionately large, a reminder that they were made to be viewed from below. So, not only does context change the meaning and interpretation of an artwork throughout its history, sometimes it can make that history resurface in the most unexpected ways.

[Music] [Applause] what do I know that would cause me a reticent Midwestern scientist to get myself arrested in front of the White House protesting and what would you do if you knew what I know let's start with how I got to this point I was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the State University and I was really lucky to go to the University of Iowa where I could study under Professor James Van Allen who built instruments for the first US satellites Professor Van Allen told me about observations of Venus that there was intense microwave radiation did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere or was Venus extremely hot the right answer confirmed by the Soviet Vena spacecraft was that Venus was very hot 900° fah and it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid but while our instrument was being built I became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on Earth because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing eventually I resigned as principal investigator on our Venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important it changes will affect all Humanity the greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century British physicist John Tindle in the 1850s made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation which is heat and he showed that Gases such as CO2 absorb heat thus acting like a blanket warming Earth's surface I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations in 1981 we published an article in Science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 de C in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO2 that Earth would likely warm in the 1980s and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century we also said that the 21st century would see shifting climate zones creation of drought prone regions in North America and Asia erosion of ice sheets rising sea levels and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage all of these impacts have since either happened or are now well underway that paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times and led to me testifying to con in the 1980s testimony in which I emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the Earth's water cycle heat waves and droughts on one hand directly from the warming but also because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy rainfall will become in more extreme events there will be stronger storms and greater flooding global warming hoop law became time consuming and distracted me from doing science partly because I had complained that the White House altered my testimony so I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others by 15 years later evidence of global warming was much stronger most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels by then we had two grandchildren Sophie and Connor I decided that I did not want them in the future to say oppa understood what was happening but he didn't make it clear so I decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004 and at the 2005 meeting of the American geophysical Union this led to calls from the White House to NASA headquarters and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by NASA headquarters after I informed the New York Times about these restrictions NASA was forced to end the censorship but there were consequences I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement to understand and protect the home planet to justify my talks soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted never to appear again over the next few years I was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies while still researching the physics of climate change let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics first from Earth's energy balance and second from Earth's climate history adding CO2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed it reduces Earth's heat radiation to space so there's a temporary energy imbalance more energy is coming in than going out until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun so the key quantity is Earth's energy imbalance is there more energy coming in than going out if so more warming is in the pipeline it will occur without adding any more greenhouse gases now finally we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth's heat reservoirs the biggest Reservoir the ocean was the least well measured until until more than 3,000 Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean these floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining Heat at a substantial rate the deep ocean is also gaining Heat at a smaller rate and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet and the land to depths of tens of meters is also warming the total energy imbalance now is about 6/10 of a watt per square meter that may not sound like much but when added up over the whole world it's enormous it's about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity it's equivalent to exploding 400,000 hirosima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year that's how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day this imbalance if we want to stabilize climate means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 PPM parts per million back to 350 PPM that is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change but the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record when the sun's energy reaching Earth was least yet there was more energy coming in than going out this shows that the effect of the sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gases mainly from burning fossil fuels now consider earth's climate history these curves for Global temperature atmospheric CO2 and sea level were derived from Ocean cores and Antarctic Ice cores from Ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a 2-mile thick ice sheet as you see there is a high correlation between temperature CO2 and sea level careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO2 changes by a few centuries climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying look the temperature causes CO2 to change not vice versa but that leg is exactly what is expected small changes in Earth's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on earth when there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer ice sheets melt shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer a warmer ocean releases CO2 just as a warm Coca-Cola does and more CO2 causes more warming so CO2 methane and ice sheets were feedbacks that Amplified Global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing the important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today the physics does not change as Earth warms now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere ice will melt and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost while we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur it is certain they will occur unless we stop the warming there is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning prec precise measurements by Grace the gravity satellite reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass several hundred cubic kilometers per year and the rate has accelerated since the measurements began 9 years ago methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost what sea level rise can we look forward to the last time CO2 was 390 PP M today's value sea level was higher by at least 15 m 50 ft where you are sitting now would be underwater most estimates are that this Century we will get at least one meter I think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels perhaps even 5 meters which is 18 ft this Century or shortly thereafter the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of Humanity's control ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries there would be no stable Shoreline The Economic Consequences are almost Unthinkable hundreds of New Orleans likee devastations around the world what may be more reprehensible if climate denial continues is extermination of species the monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50% of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business as usual fossil fuel use global warming is already affecting people the Texas Oklahoma Mexico Heatwave and drought last year Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003 were all exceptional events more than three standard deviations outside the norm 50 years ago such anomalies covered only 2 to 3/10 of 1% of the land area in recent years because of global warming they Now cover about 10% and increase by a factor of 25 to 50 so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heat waves were not natural they were caused by global warming an important impact if global warming continues will be on the Bread Basket of our nation and the world the Midwest in Great Plains which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts worse than the Dust Bowl within just a few decades if we let global warming continue how did I get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate giving talks in 10 countries getting arrested burning up the vacation time that I had accumulated over 30 years more grandchildren helped me along Jake is a super positive enthusiastic boy here at Age 2 and A2 years he thinks he can protect his 2 and a half day old little sister it would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple honest approach of a gradually Rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100% electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis with the government not keeping one dime most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they pay in increased prices this fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and Innovations creating millions of jobs it is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future several top economists are co-authors on this proposition Jim dep peso a Republicans for Environmental Protection describes it thusly transparent market-based does not enlarge government leaves energy decisions to individual choices sounds like a conservative climate plan but instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 4500 billion dollar per year worldwide thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel mountaintop removal long wall mining fracking tar Sands tar Shale deep ocean Arctic drilling this path if continued guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future Generations a large fraction of species will be committed to Extinction and increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact bread baskets of the world causing massive famin and economic decline imagine a giant asteroid on a direct Collision Course with earth that is the equivalent of what we face now yet we dither taking no action to divert the asteroid even though the longer we wait the more difficult and expensive it becomes if we had started in 2005 it would have required emission reductions of 3% per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabil ized climate this Century if we start next year it is 6% per year if we wait 10 years it is 15% per year extremely difficult and expensive perhaps impossible but we aren't even starting so now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm clearly I haven't got this message across the science is clear I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its Solutions more effectively we owe it to our children and

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] what do I know that would cause me a reticent Midwestern scientist to get myself arrested in front of the White House protesting and what would you do if you knew what I know let's start with how I got to this point I was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the State University and I was really lucky to go to the University of Iowa where I could study under Professor James Van Allen who built instruments for the first US satellites Professor Van Allen told me about observations of Venus that there was intense microwave radiation did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere or was Venus extremely hot the right answer confirmed by the Soviet Vena spacecraft was that Venus was very hot 900° fah and it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid but while our instrument was being built I became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on Earth because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing eventually I resigned as principal investigator on our Venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important it changes will affect all Humanity the greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century British physicist John Tindle in the 1850s made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation which is heat and he showed that Gases such as CO2 absorb heat thus acting like a blanket warming Earth's surface I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations in 1981 we published an article in Science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 de C in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO2 that Earth would likely warm in the 1980s and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century we also said that the 21st century would see shifting climate zones creation of drought prone regions in North America and Asia erosion of ice sheets rising sea levels and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage all of these impacts have since either happened or are now well underway that paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times and led to me testifying to con in the 1980s testimony in which I emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the Earth's water cycle heat waves and droughts on one hand directly from the warming but also because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy rainfall will become in more extreme events there will be stronger storms and greater flooding global warming hoop law became time consuming and distracted me from doing science partly because I had complained that the White House altered my testimony so I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others by 15 years later evidence of global warming was much stronger most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels by then we had two grandchildren Sophie and Connor I decided that I did not want them in the future to say oppa understood what was happening but he didn't make it clear so I decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004 and at the 2005 meeting of the American geophysical Union this led to calls from the White House to NASA headquarters and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by NASA headquarters after I informed the New York Times about these restrictions NASA was forced to end the censorship but there were consequences I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement to understand and protect the home planet to justify my talks soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted never to appear again over the next few years I was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies while still researching the physics of climate change let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics first from Earth's energy balance and second from Earth's climate history adding CO2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed it reduces Earth's heat radiation to space so there's a temporary energy imbalance more energy is coming in than going out until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun so the key quantity is Earth's energy imbalance is there more energy coming in than going out if so more warming is in the pipeline it will occur without adding any more greenhouse gases now finally we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth's heat reservoirs the biggest Reservoir the ocean was the least well measured until until more than 3,000 Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean these floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining Heat at a substantial rate the deep ocean is also gaining Heat at a smaller rate and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet and the land to depths of tens of meters is also warming the total energy imbalance now is about 6/10 of a watt per square meter that may not sound like much but when added up over the whole world it's enormous it's about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity it's equivalent to exploding 400,000 hirosima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year that's how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day this imbalance if we want to stabilize climate means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 PPM parts per million back to 350 PPM that is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change but the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record when the sun's energy reaching Earth was least yet there was more energy coming in than going out this shows that the effect of the sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gases mainly from burning fossil fuels now consider earth's climate history these curves for Global temperature atmospheric CO2 and sea level were derived from Ocean cores and Antarctic Ice cores from Ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a 2-mile thick ice sheet as you see there is a high correlation between temperature CO2 and sea level careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO2 changes by a few centuries climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying look the temperature causes CO2 to change not vice versa but that leg is exactly what is expected small changes in Earth's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on earth when there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer ice sheets melt shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer a warmer ocean releases CO2 just as a warm Coca-Cola does and more CO2 causes more warming so CO2 methane and ice sheets were feedbacks that Amplified Global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing the important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today the physics does not change as Earth warms now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere ice will melt and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost while we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur it is certain they will occur unless we stop the warming there is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning prec precise measurements by Grace the gravity satellite reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass several hundred cubic kilometers per year and the rate has accelerated since the measurements began 9 years ago methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost what sea level rise can we look forward to the last time CO2 was 390 PP M today's value sea level was higher by at least 15 m 50 ft where you are sitting now would be underwater most estimates are that this Century we will get at least one meter I think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels perhaps even 5 meters which is 18 ft this Century or shortly thereafter the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of Humanity's control ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries there would be no stable Shoreline The Economic Consequences are almost Unthinkable hundreds of New Orleans likee devastations around the world what may be more reprehensible if climate denial continues is extermination of species the monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50% of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business as usual fossil fuel use global warming is already affecting people the Texas Oklahoma Mexico Heatwave and drought last year Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003 were all exceptional events more than three standard deviations outside the norm 50 years ago such anomalies covered only 2 to 3/10 of 1% of the land area in recent years because of global warming they Now cover about 10% and increase by a factor of 25 to 50 so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heat waves were not natural they were caused by global warming an important impact if global warming continues will be on the Bread Basket of our nation and the world the Midwest in Great Plains which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts worse than the Dust Bowl within just a few decades if we let global warming continue how did I get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate giving talks in 10 countries getting arrested burning up the vacation time that I had accumulated over 30 years more grandchildren helped me along Jake is a super positive enthusiastic boy here at Age 2 and A2 years he thinks he can protect his 2 and a half day old little sister it would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple honest approach of a gradually Rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100% electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis with the government not keeping one dime most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they pay in increased prices this fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and Innovations creating millions of jobs it is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future several top economists are co-authors on this proposition Jim dep peso a Republicans for Environmental Protection describes it thusly transparent market-based does not enlarge government leaves energy decisions to individual choices sounds like a conservative climate plan but instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 4500 billion dollar per year worldwide thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel mountaintop removal long wall mining fracking tar Sands tar Shale deep ocean Arctic drilling this path if continued guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future Generations a large fraction of species will be committed to Extinction and increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact bread baskets of the world causing massive famin and economic decline imagine a giant asteroid on a direct Collision Course with earth that is the equivalent of what we face now yet we dither taking no action to divert the asteroid even though the longer we wait the more difficult and expensive it becomes if we had started in 2005 it would have required emission reductions of 3% per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabil ized climate this Century if we start next year it is 6% per year if we wait 10 years it is 15% per year extremely difficult and expensive perhaps impossible but we aren't even starting so now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm clearly I haven't got this message across the science is clear I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its Solutions more effectively we owe it to our children and grandchildren thank [Applause] [Music] you

**Transcript**:
Tattoos have often been presented in popular media as either marks
of the dangerous and deviant or trendy youth fads. But while tattoo styles come and go, and their meaning has differed
greatly across cultures, the practice is as old
as civilization itself. Decorative skin markings have
been discovered in human remains all over the world, with the oldest found on a Peruvian
mummy dating back to 6,000 BCE. But have you ever wondered
how tattooing really works? You may know that we shed our skin, losing about 30-40,000
skin cells per hour. That's about 1,000,000 per day. So, how come the tattoo doesn't
gradually flake off along with them? The simple answer
is that tattooing involves getting pigment deeper into the skin than the outermost layer that gets shed. Throughout history, different cultures have used various methods
to accomplish this. But the first modern tattooing machine was modeled after Thomas Edison's
engraving machine and ran on electricity. Tattooing machines used today insert tiny needles,
loaded with dye, into the skin at a frequency of 50
to 3,000 times per minute. The needles punch through the epidermis, allowing ink to seep deep into the dermis, which is composed of collagen fibers,
nerves, glands, blood vessels and more. Every time a needle
penetrates, it causes a wound that alerts the body to begin
the inflammatory process, calling immune system cells
to the wound site to begin repairing the skin. And it is this very process
that makes tattoos permanent. First, specialized cells
called macrophages eat the invading material in an attempt
to clean up the inflammatory mess. As these cells travel
through the lymphatic system, some of them are carried back with a belly
full of dye into the lymph nodes while others remain in the dermis. With no way to dispose of the pigment, the dyes inside them remain
visible through the skin. Some of the ink particles
are also suspended in the gel-like matrix of the dermis, while others are engulfed
by dermal cells called fibroblasts. Initially, ink is deposited
into the epidermis as well, but as the skin heals, the damaged
epidermal cells are shed and replaced by new, dye-free cells with the topmost layer peeling
off like a heeling sunburn. Blistering or crusting is not typically
seen with professional tattoos and complete epidermal
regeneration requires 2-4 weeks, during which excess
sun exposure and swimming should be avoided to prevent fading. Dermal cells, however,
remain in place until they die. When they do, they are taken up,
ink and all, by younger cells nearby, so the ink stays where it is. But with time, tattoos do fade naturally as the body reacts
to the alien pigment particles, slowly breaking them down
to be carried off by the immune system's macrophages. Ultraviolet radiation can also
contribute to this pigment breakdown, though it can be mitigated
by the use of sunblock. But since the dermal cells
are relatively stable, much of the ink will remain deep
in the skin for a person's whole life. But if tattoos are embedded in your skin
for life, is there any way to erase them? Technically, yes. Today, a laser is used
to penetrate the epidermis and blast apart underlying pigment
colors of various wavelengths, black being the easiest to target. The laser beam breaks the ink globules
into smaller particles that can then be cleared away
by the macrophages. But some color inks are harder
to remove than others, and there could be complications. For this reason, removing a tattoo
is still more difficult than getting one, but not impossible. So a single tattoo may
not truly last forever, but tattoos have been around longer
than any existing culture. And their continuing popularity means
that the art of tattooing is here to stay.

**Transcript**:
Tattoos have often been presented in popular media as either marks
of the dangerous and deviant or trendy youth fads. But while tattoo styles come and go, and their meaning has differed
greatly across cultures, the practice is as old
as civilization itself. Decorative skin markings have
been discovered in human remains all over the world, with the oldest found on a Peruvian
mummy dating back to 6,000 BCE. But have you ever wondered
how tattooing really works? You may know that we shed our skin, losing about 30-40,000
skin cells per hour. That's about 1,000,000 per day. So, how come the tattoo doesn't
gradually flake off along with them? The simple answer
is that tattooing involves getting pigment deeper into the skin than the outermost layer that gets shed. Throughout history, different cultures have used various methods
to accomplish this. But the first modern tattooing machine was modeled after Thomas Edison's
engraving machine and ran on electricity. Tattooing machines used today insert tiny needles,
loaded with dye, into the skin at a frequency of 50
to 3,000 times per minute. The needles punch through the epidermis, allowing ink to seep deep into the dermis, which is composed of collagen fibers,
nerves, glands, blood vessels and more. Every time a needle
penetrates, it causes a wound that alerts the body to begin
the inflammatory process, calling immune system cells
to the wound site to begin repairing the skin. And it is this very process
that makes tattoos permanent. First, specialized cells
called macrophages eat the invading material in an attempt
to clean up the inflammatory mess. As these cells travel
through the lymphatic system, some of them are carried back with a belly
full of dye into the lymph nodes while others remain in the dermis. With no way to dispose of the pigment, the dyes inside them remain
visible through the skin. Some of the ink particles
are also suspended in the gel-like matrix of the dermis, while others are engulfed
by dermal cells called fibroblasts. Initially, ink is deposited
into the epidermis as well, but as the skin heals, the damaged
epidermal cells are shed and replaced by new, dye-free cells with the topmost layer peeling
off like a heeling sunburn. Blistering or crusting is not typically
seen with professional tattoos and complete epidermal
regeneration requires 2-4 weeks, during which excess
sun exposure and swimming should be avoided to prevent fading. Dermal cells, however,
remain in place until they die. When they do, they are taken up,
ink and all, by younger cells nearby, so the ink stays where it is. But with time, tattoos do fade naturally as the body reacts
to the alien pigment particles, slowly breaking them down
to be carried off by the immune system's macrophages. Ultraviolet radiation can also
contribute to this pigment breakdown, though it can be mitigated
by the use of sunblock. But since the dermal cells
are relatively stable, much of the ink will remain deep
in the skin for a person's whole life. But if tattoos are embedded in your skin
for life, is there any way to erase them? Technically, yes. Today, a laser is used
to penetrate the epidermis and blast apart underlying pigment
colors of various wavelengths, black being the easiest to target. The laser beam breaks the ink globules
into smaller particles that can then be cleared away
by the macrophages. But some color inks are harder
to remove than others, and there could be complications. For this reason, removing a tattoo
is still more difficult than getting one, but not impossible. So a single tattoo may
not truly last forever, but tattoos have been around longer
than any existing culture. And their continuing popularity means
that the art of tattooing is here to stay.

**Transcript**:
Tattoos have often been presented in popular media as either marks
of the dangerous and deviant or trendy youth fads. But while tattoo styles come and go, and their meaning has differed
greatly across cultures, the practice is as old
as civilization itself. Decorative skin markings have
been discovered in human remains all over the world, with the oldest found on a Peruvian
mummy dating back to 6,000 BCE. But have you ever wondered
how tattooing really works? You may know that we shed our skin, losing about 30-40,000
skin cells per hour. That's about 1,000,000 per day. So, how come the tattoo doesn't
gradually flake off along with them? The simple answer
is that tattooing involves getting pigment deeper into the skin than the outermost layer that gets shed. Throughout history, different cultures have used various methods
to accomplish this. But the first modern tattooing machine was modeled after Thomas Edison's
engraving machine and ran on electricity. Tattooing machines used today insert tiny needles,
loaded with dye, into the skin at a frequency of 50
to 3,000 times per minute. The needles punch through the epidermis, allowing ink to seep deep into the dermis, which is composed of collagen fibers,
nerves, glands, blood vessels and more. Every time a needle
penetrates, it causes a wound that alerts the body to begin
the inflammatory process, calling immune system cells
to the wound site to begin repairing the skin. And it is this very process
that makes tattoos permanent. First, specialized cells
called macrophages eat the invading material in an attempt
to clean up the inflammatory mess. As these cells travel
through the lymphatic system, some of them are carried back with a belly
full of dye into the lymph nodes while others remain in the dermis. With no way to dispose of the pigment, the dyes inside them remain
visible through the skin. Some of the ink particles
are also suspended in the gel-like matrix of the dermis, while others are engulfed
by dermal cells called fibroblasts. Initially, ink is deposited
into the epidermis as well, but as the skin heals, the damaged
epidermal cells are shed and replaced by new, dye-free cells with the topmost layer peeling
off like a heeling sunburn. Blistering or crusting is not typically
seen with professional tattoos and complete epidermal
regeneration requires 2-4 weeks, during which excess
sun exposure and swimming should be avoided to prevent fading. Dermal cells, however,
remain in place until they die. When they do, they are taken up,
ink and all, by younger cells nearby, so the ink stays where it is. But with time, tattoos do fade naturally as the body reacts
to the alien pigment particles, slowly breaking them down
to be carried off by the immune system's macrophages. Ultraviolet radiation can also
contribute to this pigment breakdown, though it can be mitigated
by the use of sunblock. But since the dermal cells
are relatively stable, much of the ink will remain deep
in the skin for a person's whole life. But if tattoos are embedded in your skin
for life, is there any way to erase them? Technically, yes. Today, a laser is used
to penetrate the epidermis and blast apart underlying pigment
colors of various wavelengths, black being the easiest to target. The laser beam breaks the ink globules
into smaller particles that can then be cleared away
by the macrophages. But some color inks are harder
to remove than others, and there could be complications. For this reason, removing a tattoo
is still more difficult than getting one, but not impossible. So a single tattoo may
not truly last forever, but tattoos have been around longer
than any existing culture. And their continuing popularity means
that the art of tattooing is here to stay.

**Transcript**:
They say, 'Time is money,' but what does one really have to do with the other? Meet Sheila! She just got her first big bonus. Sheila knows exactly what she wants to do with that money. She's had her eye on a nice convertible for a while now. Yes, Sheila, that's a nice car! Oh, looks like Sheila is a little short. But wait! She has an idea. Sheila is a smart cookie. She knows that if she deposits the money for a year instead of buying the car today, she will earn interest. Then she'll be able to afford the car. Sheila knows that the value of her deposit one year from now will equal the money deposited today plus the interest earned. We call Sheila's money deposited today the present value of money. And the value of Sheila's deposit next year is the future value of money. What connects one to the other? The interest rate, also known as the time value of money. Now, with a little bit of rearranging, we can figure out the future value of Sheila's money with this equation. So in a year, the future value will be $11,000. Well, it's been a year! And there's Sheila, with enough money to buy the car. Sheila really understands the future value of money. Now, I just hope she understands the speed limit! Now, meet Timmy. He's also gotten his bonus. The money seems to be burning a hole in his pocket. Yes, Timmy, that's a nice car that will surely impress people. Oh! Looks like you're a little short. Maybe you can follow Sheila's example. You see, Timmy, just like Sheila, after the first year, you'll have $11,000. But Timmy, that is still not enough to buy that fancy car. Why don't you leave the money deposited for another year? Let's see how your deposit will be doing in two years. With a little bit of rearranging, it becomes the value of your money next year, times one plus the interest rate. We can then convert the future value one year from now to the present value times one plus the interest rate. We can even simplify this further by just squaring the value of one plus the interest rate. Sorry, Timmy, you'll have more money after two years, but you still can't afford the car! I don't know how many more years you'll have to wait, but I can tell you one way we can figure it out. Do you see that little number two in the equation? Any number that you put in there is the number of years that you are waiting, also known as the period. Sure, Timmy, we can see how much you'll have in five years. Let's connect future value and present value across five years. Let's watch the period increase from two to five. After 5 years, you'll have $16,105.10. Sorry, Timmy, you have to wait a little longer. 10 years? Yeah! Let's see if you'll be able to buy the car then. Not quite. Well, Timmy, it looks like you'll need 26 years to afford this car. You should ask Sheila for a ride to the beach. Maybe a bicycle will suit you better? I hear the bus is pretty cheap!

They say, 'Time is money,' but what does one really have to do with the other? Meet Sheila! She just got her first big bonus. Sheila knows exactly what she wants to do with that money. She's had her eye on a nice convertible for a while now. Yes, Sheila, that's a nice car! Oh, looks like Sheila is a little short. But wait! She has an idea. Sheila is a smart cookie. She knows that if she deposits the money for a year instead of buying the car today, she will earn interest. Then she'll be able to afford the car. Sheila knows that the value of her deposit one year from now will equal the money deposited today plus the interest earned. We call Sheila's money deposited today the present value of money. And the value of Sheila's deposit next year is the future value of money. What connects one to the other? The interest rate, also known as the time value of money. Now, with a little bit of rearranging, we can figure out the future value of Sheila's money with this equation. So in a year, the future value will be $11,000. Well, it's been a year! And there's Sheila, with enough money to buy the car. Sheila really understands the future value of money. Now, I just hope she understands the speed limit! Now, meet Timmy.

"All men are created equal and they are endowed with the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Not so fast, Mr. Jefferson! These words from the Declaration of Independence, and the facts behind them, are well known. In June of 1776, a little more than a year after the war against England began with the shots fired at Lexington and Concord, the Continental Congress was meeting in Philadelphia to discuss American independence. After long debates, a resolution of independence was approved on July 2, 1776. America was free! And men like John Adams thought we would celebrate that date forever. But it was two days later that the gentlemen in Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence, largely written by Thomas Jefferson, offering all the reasons why the country should be free. More than 235 years later, we celebrate that day as America's birthday. But there are some pieces of the story you may not know. First of all, Thomas Jefferson gets the credit for writing the Declaration, but five men had been given the job to come up with a document explaining why America should be independent: Robert Livingston, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams were all named first. And it was Adams who suggested that the young, and little known, Thomas Jefferson join them because they needed a man from the influential Virginia Delegation, and Adams thought Jefferson was a much better writer than he was. Second, though Jefferson never used footnotes, or credited his sources, some of his memorable words and phrases were borrowed from other writers and slightly tweaked. Then, Franklin and Adams offered a few suggestions. But the most important change came after the Declaration was turned over to the full Congress. For two days, a very unhappy Thomas Jefferson sat and fumed while his words were picked over. In the end, the Congress made a few, minor word changes, and one big deletion. In the long list of charges that Jefferson made against the King of England, the author of the Declaration had included the idea that George the Third was responsible for the slave trade, and was preventing America from ending slavery. That was not only untrue, but Congress wanted no mention of slavery in the nation's founding document. The reference was cut out before the Declaration was approved and sent to the printer. But it leaves open the hard question: How could the men, who were about to sign a document, celebrating liberty and equality, accept a system in which some people owned others? It is a question that would eventually bring the nation to civil war and one we can still ask today.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I will provide the index of the least dissimilar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about Congress eliminating a reference to slavery from the Declaration of Independence. None of the generated MCQs are related to this topic. However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar.

But if I really had to choose, I would say that Question 3 is the least dissimilar, only because it mentions something being "released" or "lost", which is vaguely similar to something being "eliminated". However, this is a huge stretch, and I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

In the long list of charges that Jefferson made against the King of England, the author of the Declaration had included the idea that George the Third was responsible for the slave trade, and was preventing America from ending slavery. That was not only untrue, but Congress wanted no mention of slavery in the nation's founding document. The reference was cut out before the Declaration was approved and sent to the printer. But it leaves open the hard question: How could the men, who were about to sign a document, celebrating liberty and equality, accept a system in which some people owned others? It is a question that would eventually bring the nation to civil war and one we can still ask today.

**Transcript**:
Energy is all around us, a physical quantity that follows
precise natural laws. Our universe has a finite amount of it; it's neither created nor destroyed but can take different forms, such as kinetic or potential energy, with different properties
and formulas to remember. For instance, an LED desk lamp's 6 Watt bulb transfers 6 Joules
of light energy per second. But let's jump back up into space to look at our planet,
its systems, and their energy flow. Earth's physical systems include the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. Energy moves in and out of these systems, and during any energy
transfer between them, some is lost to the surroundings, as heat, light, sound, vibration, or movement. Our planet's energy comes from
internal and external sources. Geothermal energy
from radioactive isotopes and rotational energy
from the spinning of the Earth are internal sources of energy, while the Sun
is the major external source, driving certain systems,
like our weather and climate. Sunlight warms the surface and atmosphere
in varying amounts, and this causes convection, producing winds
and influencing ocean currents. Infrared radiation, radiating out
from the warmed surface of the Earth, gets trapped by greenhouse gases
and further affects the energy flow. The Sun is also the major source
of energy for organisms. Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use sunlight to produce organic matter from carbon dioxide and water, powering the biosphere's food chains. We release this food energy
using chemical reactions, like combustion and respiration. At each level in a food chain,
some energy is stored in newly made chemical structures, but most is lost to the surroundings, as heat, like your body heat, released by your digestion of food. Now, as plants are eaten
by primary consumers, only about 10% of their total energy
is passed on to the next level. Since energy can only flow
in one direction in a food chain, from producers on to consumers
and decomposers, an organism that eats lower
on the food chain, is more efficient than one higher up. So eating producers
is the most efficient level at which an animal can get its energy, but without continual input of energy
to those producers, mostly from sunlight, life on Earth as we know it
would cease to exist. We humans, of course, spend our energy
doing a lot of things besides eating. We travel, we build, we power
all sorts of technology. To do all this, we use sources like fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas, which contain energy that plants captured
from sunlight long ago and stored in the form of carbon. When we burn fossil fuels in power plants, we release this stored energy to generate electricity. To generate electricity, heat from burning fossil fuels
is used to power turbines that rotate magnets, which, in turn, create
magnetic field changes relative to a coil of wire, causing electrons to be
induced to flow in the wire. Modern civilization depends on our ability to keep powering that flow of electrons. Fortunately, we aren't limited
to burning non-renewable fossil fuels to generate electricity. Electrons can also be induced to flow by direct interaction
with light particles, which is how a solar cell operates. Other renewable energy sources, such as wind, water, geothermal, and biofuels can also be used to generate electricity. Global demand for energy is increasing, but the planet
has limited energy resources to access through a complex
energy infrastructure. As populations rise, alongside rates of industrialization
and development, our energy decisions grow
more and more important. Access to energy
impacts health, education, political power, and socioeconomic status. If we improve our energy efficiency, we can use our natural resources
more responsibly and improve quality of life for everyone.

its systems, and their energy flow. Earth's physical systems include the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. Energy moves in and out of these systems, and during any energy
transfer between them, some is lost to the surroundings, as heat, light, sound, vibration, or movement. Our planet's energy comes from
internal and external sources. Geothermal energy
from radioactive isotopes and rotational energy
from the spinning of the Earth are internal sources of energy, while the Sun
is the major external source, driving certain systems,
like our weather and climate. Sunlight warms the surface and atmosphere
in varying amounts, and this causes convection, producing winds
and influencing ocean currents. Infrared radiation, radiating out
from the warmed surface of the Earth, gets trapped by greenhouse gases
and further affects the energy flow. The Sun is also the major source
of energy for organisms. Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use sunlight to produce organic matter from carbon dioxide and water, powering the biosphere's food chains. We release this food energy
using chemical reactions, like combustion and respiration. At each level in a food chain,
some energy is stored in newly made chemical structures, but most is lost to the surroundings, as heat, like your body heat, released by your digestion of food. Now, as plants are eaten
by primary consumers, only about 10% of their total energy
is passed on to the next level. Since energy can only flow
in one direction in a food chain, from producers on to consumers
and decomposers, an organism that eats lower
on the food chain, is more efficient than one higher up. So eating producers
is the most efficient level at which an animal can get its energy, but without continual input of energy
to those producers, mostly from sunlight, life on Earth as we know it
would cease to exist. We humans, of course, spend our energy
doing a lot of things besides eating. We travel, we build, we power
all sorts of technology. To do all this, we use sources like fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas, which contain energy that plants captured
from sunlight long ago and stored in the form of carbon. When we burn fossil fuels in power plants, we release this stored energy to generate electricity. To generate electricity, heat from burning fossil fuels
is used to power turbines that rotate magnets, which, in turn, create
magnetic field changes relative to a coil of wire, causing electrons to be
induced to flow in the wire. Modern civilization depends on our ability to keep powering that flow of electrons. Fortunately, we aren't limited
to burning non-renewable fossil fuels to generate electricity. Electrons can also be induced to flow by direct interaction
with light particles, which is how a solar cell operates. Other renewable energy sources, such as wind, water, geothermal, and biofuels can also be used to generate electricity. Global demand for energy is increasing, but the planet
has limited energy resources to access through a complex
energy infrastructure. As populations rise, alongside rates of industrialization
and development, our energy decisions grow
more and more important. Access to energy
impacts health, education, political power, and socioeconomic status. If we improve our energy efficiency, we can use our natural resources
more responsibly and improve quality of life for everyone.

Energy is all around us, a physical quantity that follows
precise natural laws. Our universe has a finite amount of it; it's neither created nor destroyed but can take different forms, such as kinetic or potential energy, with different properties

**Transcript**:
We've all seen the movies where a monster, created by a scientist in a laboratory, escapes to wreak havoc on the outside world. But what if the monster was not some giant rampaging beast, destroying a city, but just a tiny amount of seaweed with the potential to disrupt entire coastal ecosystems? This is the story of Caulerpa taxifolia, originally a naturally occurring seaweed native to tropical waters. In the 1980s, one strain was found to thrive in colder environments. This trait, combined with its beautiful, bright green color and ability to grow quickly without maintenance made it ideal for aquariums, which it helped keep clean by consuming nutrients and chemicals in the water. Further selective breeding made it even heartier, and soon it was used in aquariums around the world. But it was not long before a sample of this aquarium-developed super algae turned up in the Mediterranean Sea near the famed Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. The marine biologist who found it believed that the museum had accidentally realeased it into the ocean along with aquarium waters, while museum directors claimed it had be carried into the area by ocean currents. Regardless of how it ended up there, the non-native Caulerpa multiplied rapidly, having no natural predators due to releasing a toxin that keeps fish away. And like some mythical monster, even a tiny piece that broke off could grow into a whole new colony. Through water currents and contact with boat anchors and fishing lines, it fragmented and spread throughout Mediterranean coastal cities covering coral reefs. So what was the result of this invasion? Well, it depends on who you ask. Many scientists warned that the spread of Caulerpa reduces biodiversity by crowding out native species of seaweed that are eaten by fish, with the biologist who first discovered its presence dubbing it Killer Algae. Other studies instead claim that the algae actually had a beneficial effect by consuming chemical pollutants -- one reason the aquariums strain was developed. But the disruption of a natural ecosystem by an introduced foreign species can have unpredictable and uncontrollable effects that may not be immediately visible. So when Culerpa taxifolia was discovered at Carlsbad's Agua Hedionda Lagoon, near San Diego in the year 2000, having most likely come from the dumping of home aquarium water into a connecting storm drain, it was decided to stop it before it spread. Tarps were placed over the Culerpa colonies and chlorine injected inside. Although this method killed all other marine life trapped under the tarps, it did succeed in eradicating the algae and native eelgrass was able to emerge in its place. By responding quickly, authorities in California were able to prevent Culerpa from propagating. But another occurrence of the strain, in the coastal wetlands of southeast Australia, was left unchecked and allowed to spread. And unfortunately, a tarp cannot cover the Mediterranean Sea or the Australian coast. Invasive species are not a new problem, and can indeed occur naturally. But when such species are the results of human directed selective breeding or genetic modification and then released into the natural environment, their effect on ecosystems can be far more radical and irreversible. With the proliferation of new technologies and multiple threats to the environment, it is more important than ever for scientists to monitor and evaluate the risks and dangers, and for the rest of us to remember that what starts in our backyard can effect ecosystems half a world away.

**Transcript**:
We've all seen the movies where a monster, created by a scientist in a laboratory, escapes to wreak havoc on the outside world. But what if the monster was not some giant rampaging beast, destroying a city, but just a tiny amount of seaweed with the potential to disrupt entire coastal ecosystems? This is the story of Caulerpa taxifolia, originally a naturally occurring seaweed native to tropical waters. In the 1980s, one strain was found to thrive in colder environments. This trait, combined with its beautiful, bright green color and ability to grow quickly without maintenance made it ideal for aquariums, which it helped keep clean by consuming nutrients and chemicals in the water. Further selective breeding made it even heartier, and soon it was used in aquariums around the world. But it was not long before a sample of this aquarium-developed super algae turned up in the Mediterranean Sea near the famed Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. The marine biologist who found it believed that the museum had accidentally realeased it into the ocean along with aquarium waters, while museum directors claimed it had be carried into the area by ocean currents. Regardless of how it ended up there, the non-native Caulerpa multiplied rapidly, having no natural predators due to releasing a toxin that keeps fish away. And like some mythical monster, even a tiny piece that broke off could grow into a whole new colony. Through water currents and contact with boat anchors and fishing lines, it fragmented and spread throughout Mediterranean coastal cities covering coral reefs. So what was the result of this invasion? Well, it depends on who you ask. Many scientists warned that the spread of Caulerpa reduces biodiversity by crowding out native species of seaweed that are eaten by fish, with the biologist who first discovered its presence dubbing it Killer Algae. Other studies instead claim that the algae actually had a beneficial effect by consuming chemical pollutants -- one reason the aquariums strain was developed. But the disruption of a natural ecosystem by an introduced foreign species can have unpredictable and uncontrollable effects that may not be immediately visible. So when Culerpa taxifolia was discovered at Carlsbad's Agua Hedionda Lagoon, near San Diego in the year 2000, having most likely come from the dumping of home aquarium water into a connecting storm drain, it was decided to stop it before it spread. Tarps were placed over the Culerpa colonies and chlorine injected inside. Although this method killed all other marine life trapped under the tarps, it did succeed in eradicating the algae and native eelgrass was able to emerge in its place. By responding quickly, authorities in California were able to prevent Culerpa from propagating. But another occurrence of the strain, in the coastal wetlands of southeast Australia, was left unchecked and allowed to spread. And unfortunately, a tarp cannot cover the Mediterranean Sea or the Australian coast. Invasive species are not a new problem, and can indeed occur naturally. But when such species are the results of human directed selective breeding or genetic modification and then released into the natural environment, their effect on ecosystems can be far more radical and irreversible. With the proliferation of new technologies and multiple threats to the environment, it is more important than ever for scientists to monitor and evaluate the risks and dangers, and for the rest of us to remember that what starts in our backyard can effect ecosystems half a world away.

**Transcript**:
We have some good reasons to completely switch over to solar power. It's cheaper in many cases, and definitely more sustainable than our dependance on traditional power plants that use resources like coal, which will eventually run out. So why don't we replace these traditional plants with solar energy? Because there's one factor that makes solar power very unpredictable: cloud cover. As the sun's rays move towards Earth, some get absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, some are reflected back into outer space, but the rest make it to the Earth's surface. The ones that aren't deviated are called direct irradiance. The ones that are deflected by clouds are called diffuse irradiance. And those rays that first get reflected by a surface, like a nearby building, before reaching the solar energy system are called reflected irradiance. But before we can examine how clouds affect the sun's rays and electricity production, let's see how these solar energy systems work. First up, we have solar towers. These are made up of a central tower surrounded by a huge field of mirrors that track the sun's path and focus only the direct rays onto a single point on the tower, kind of like an eager beachgoer. The heat generated by these rays is so immense that it can be used to boil water producing steam that drives a traditional turbine, which makes electricity. But when we say solar energy systems, we're usually talking about photovoltaics, or solar panels, which are the systems most commonly used to generate solar power. In solar panels, photons from the sun's rays hit the surface of a panel, and electrons are released to get an electric current going. Solar panels can use all types of irradiance, while solar towers can only use direct irradiance, and this is where clouds become important because depending on their type and location relative to the sun, they can either increase or decrease the amount of electricity produced. For instance, even a few cumulus clouds in front of the sun can reduce the electricity production in solar towers to almost zero because of this dependence on direct rays. In solar panels, those clouds would decrease energy output as well, though not as much because solar panels can use all types of irradiance. However, all this depends on the clouds exact positioning. Due to reflection, or a particular phenomeon called Mie scattering, the sun's rays can actually be focused forward by clouds to create a more than 50% increase in the solar irradiance reaching a solar panel. If this potential increase isn't accounted for, it could damage the solar panel. Why does this matter? Well, you wouldn't want this lesson to stop just because a cloud passed over the panel on your roof. In solar towers, huge tanks of molten salt or oil can be used to store any excess heat and use it when needed, so that's how they manage the problem of fluctuating solar irradiance to smooth out electricity production. But in the case of solar panels, there currently isn't any way to affordably store extra energy. That's where traditional power plants come in because to correct for any fluctuations in these solar powered plants, extra electricity from traditional sources always needs to be available. But then why aren't these tradtional power plants just used as a backup, instead of us humans depending on them as our main sources of energy? Because it's impossible for an employee at a coal fired or a nuclear plant to turn a knob to produce more or less electricity depending on how many clouds there are in the sky. The response time would simply be too slow. Instead, to accommodate these fluctuations, some extra electricity from traditional power plants is always being produced. On clear sky days, that extra electricity might be wasted, but when cloudy skies prevail, it's what fills the gap. This is what we currently depend on for a constant supply of energy.

**Transcript**:
We have some good reasons to completely switch over to solar power. It's cheaper in many cases, and definitely more sustainable than our dependance on traditional power plants that use resources like coal, which will eventually run out. So why don't we replace these traditional plants with solar energy? Because there's one factor that makes solar power very unpredictable: cloud cover. As the sun's rays move towards Earth, some get absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, some are reflected back into outer space, but the rest make it to the Earth's surface. The ones that aren't deviated are called direct irradiance. The ones that are deflected by clouds are called diffuse irradiance. And those rays that first get reflected by a surface, like a nearby building, before reaching the solar energy system are called reflected irradiance. But before we can examine how clouds affect the sun's rays and electricity production, let's see how these solar energy systems work. First up, we have solar towers. These are made up of a central tower surrounded by a huge field of mirrors that track the sun's path and focus only the direct rays onto a single point on the tower, kind of like an eager beachgoer. The heat generated by these rays is so immense that it can be used to boil water producing steam that drives a traditional turbine, which makes electricity. But when we say solar energy systems, we're usually talking about photovoltaics, or solar panels, which are the systems most commonly used to generate solar power. In solar panels, photons from the sun's rays hit the surface of a panel, and electrons are released to get an electric current going. Solar panels can use all types of irradiance, while solar towers can only use direct irradiance, and this is where clouds become important because depending on their type and location relative to the sun, they can either increase or decrease the amount of electricity produced. For instance, even a few cumulus clouds in front of the sun can reduce the electricity production in solar towers to almost zero because of this dependence on direct rays. In solar panels, those clouds would decrease energy output as well, though not as much because solar panels can use all types of irradiance. However, all this depends on the clouds exact positioning. Due to reflection, or a particular phenomeon called Mie scattering, the sun's rays can actually be focused forward by clouds to create a more than 50% increase in the solar irradiance reaching a solar panel. If this potential increase isn't accounted for, it could damage the solar panel. Why does this matter? Well, you wouldn't want this lesson to stop just because a cloud passed over the panel on your roof. In solar towers, huge tanks of molten salt or oil can be used to store any excess heat and use it when needed, so that's how they manage the problem of fluctuating solar irradiance to smooth out electricity production. But in the case of solar panels, there currently isn't any way to affordably store extra energy. That's where traditional power plants come in because to correct for any fluctuations in these solar powered plants, extra electricity from traditional sources always needs to be available. But then why aren't these tradtional power plants just used as a backup, instead of us humans depending on them as our main sources of energy? Because it's impossible for an employee at a coal fired or a nuclear plant to turn a knob to produce more or less electricity depending on how many clouds there are in the sky. The response time would simply be too slow. Instead, to accommodate these fluctuations, some extra electricity from traditional power plants is always being produced. On clear sky days, that extra electricity might be wasted, but when cloudy skies prevail, it's what fills the gap. This is what we currently depend on for a constant supply of energy. For this reason, a lot of researchers are interested in forcasting the motion and formation of clouds through satellite images or cameras that look up at the sky to maximize the energy from solar power plants and minimize energy waste. If we could accomplish that, you'd be able to enjoy this video powered solely by the sun's rays, no matter what the weather, although if the sun is shining, you may be tempted to venture outside to go and do a different kind of cloud gazing.

If we could accomplish that, you'd be able to enjoy this video powered solely by the sun's rays, no matter what the weather, although if the sun is shining, you may be tempted to venture outside to go and do a different kind of cloud gazing.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the main types of clouds, while the generated MCQs are about plant-pollinator networks, pollination, and ecology.

However, I must provide an answer based on the available options. In this case, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 11 is the most similar, not because of the content, but because it is the only question that asks about the number of something (plant species) among the generated MCQs.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be 11, but please note that this is a very weak match and not a true match.

It's worth mentioning that the generated MCQs seem to be from a different topic or domain than the ground truth MCQ, which makes it challenging to find a good match.

**Transcript**:
We have some good reasons to completely switch over to solar power. It's cheaper in many cases, and definitely more sustainable than our dependance on traditional power plants that use resources like coal, which will eventually run out. So why don't we replace these traditional plants with solar energy? Because there's one factor that makes solar power very unpredictable: cloud cover. As the sun's rays move towards Earth, some get absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, some are reflected back into outer space, but the rest make it to the Earth's surface. The ones that aren't deviated are called direct irradiance. The ones that are deflected by clouds are called diffuse irradiance. And those rays that first get reflected by a surface, like a nearby building, before reaching the solar energy system are called reflected irradiance. But before we can examine how clouds affect the sun's rays and electricity production, let's see how these solar energy systems work. First up, we have solar towers. These are made up of a central tower surrounded by a huge field of mirrors that track the sun's path and focus only the direct rays onto a single point on the tower, kind of like an eager beachgoer. The heat generated by these rays is so immense that it can be used to boil water producing steam that drives a traditional turbine, which makes electricity. But when we say solar energy systems, we're usually talking about photovoltaics, or solar panels, which are the systems most commonly used to generate solar power. In solar panels, photons from the sun's rays hit the surface of a panel, and electrons are released to get an electric current going. Solar panels can use all types of irradiance, while solar towers can only use direct irradiance, and this is where clouds become important because depending on their type and location relative to the sun, they can either increase or decrease the amount of electricity produced. For instance, even a few cumulus clouds in front of the sun can reduce the electricity production in solar towers to almost zero because of this dependence on direct rays. In solar panels, those clouds would decrease energy output as well, though not as much because solar panels can use all types of irradiance. However, all this depends on the clouds exact positioning. Due to reflection, or a particular phenomeon called Mie scattering, the sun's rays can actually be focused forward by clouds to create a more than 50% increase in the solar irradiance reaching a solar panel. If this potential increase isn't accounted for, it could damage the solar panel. Why does this matter? Well, you wouldn't want this lesson to stop just because a cloud passed over the panel on your roof. In solar towers, huge tanks of molten salt or oil can be used to store any excess heat and use it when needed, so that's how they manage the problem of fluctuating solar irradiance to smooth out electricity production. But in the case of solar panels, there currently isn't any way to affordably store extra energy. That's where traditional power plants come in because to correct for any fluctuations in these solar powered plants, extra electricity from traditional sources always needs to be available. But then why aren't these tradtional power plants just used as a backup, instead of us humans depending on them as our main sources of energy? Because it's impossible for an employee at a coal fired or a nuclear plant to turn a knob to produce more or less electricity depending on how many clouds there are in the sky. The response time would simply be too slow. Instead, to accommodate these fluctuations, some extra electricity from traditional power plants is always being produced. On clear sky days, that extra electricity might be wasted, but when cloudy skies prevail, it's what fills the gap. This is what we currently depend on for a constant supply of energy. For this reason, a lot of researchers are interested in forcasting the motion and formation of clouds through satellite images or cameras that look up at the sky to maximize the energy from solar power plants and minimize energy waste.

**Transcript**:
Bees are very busy little matchmakers. Wingmen in every sense of the word. You see, the bees' side of the whole "birds and the bees" business is to help plants find mates and reproduce. In their work as pollinators, honeybees are integral to the production of nearly 1/3 of the food that we eat. And these bees, dutifully helping lonely plants have sex, aren't alone. But rather are part of a very complex network of matchmaking creatures, critical for the pollination of natural ecosystems and crops. Plants in many natural ecosystems need help to have sex. Like many of us, they're too busy to find a relationship. They have too much photosynthesis to do, and they can't find the time to evolve feet and walk to a singles bar. Those places are called meat markets for a reason, because plants can't walk. So they need matchmaker pollinators to transport their pollen grains to flowers of the same plant species, and they pay these pollinators with food. Today, around 170,000 plant species receive pollination services from more than 200,000 pollinator species. Pollinators include many species of bees, butterflies, moths, flies, wasps, beetles, even birds and bats, who together help pollinate many species of trees, shrubs and other flowering plants. In return, flowering plants are an abundant and diverse food source for pollinators. For instance, fossil records suggest bees may have evolved from wasps that gave up hunting after they acquired a taste for nectar. Plant pollinator networks are everywhere. Ecologists record these networks in the field by observing which pollinators visit which plants, or by analyzing the identity of pollen loads on their bodies. Networks, registered in these ways, contain from 20 to 800 species. These networks show a repeated structure, or architecture. Pollinators interact with plants in a very heterogenous way. Most plants are specialists, they have only one or a few matchmakers. Meanwhile, only a few generalist plants hire a diverse team of matchmakers, getting visits from almost all the pollinators of the network. The same occurs with pollinators. Most are specialists that feed on only a few plant species, while a few pollinators, including the honeybee usually, are generalists, busily feeding from and matchmaking for almost all the plant species in that ecosystem. What's interesting is that specialists and generalists across both plants and pollinators, sort themselves out in a particular pattern. Most pollinator networks, for which we have data, are nested. In a nested network, specialists tend to interact more with generalists than with other specialists. This is because if you're a specialist plant, and your only matchmaker also specializes on you as its only food source, you're each more vulnerable to extinction. So, you're better off specializing on a generalist pollinator that has other sources of food to ensure its persistence in bad years. The same goes if you're a specialist pollinator. You're better off in the long run specializing on a generalist plant that gets pollinated by other species in times when you're not around to help. Finally, in addition to nestedness, the networks are usually modular. This means that the species in a network are compartmentalized into modules of plants and animals that interact more with each other than with species in other modules. Think of them like social cliques. A plant or pollinator dying off will effect the species in its module, but those effects will be less severe on the rest of the network. Why's all that important? Because plant pollinator network structure effects the stability of ecosystems. Heterogeneous distribution, nestedness and modularity enable networks to better prevent and respond to extinctions. That's critical because nature is never static. Some species may not show up every year. Plants flower at different times. Pollinators mature on varying schedules. Generalist pollinators have to adapt their preferences depending on who's flowering when. So from one flowering season to the next, the participants and patterns of matchmaking can drastically change. With all those variables, you can understand the importance of generalist pollinators, like bees, to the stability of not only a crop harvest, but the entire network of plants and pollinators we see in nature, and rely on for life. Next time you see a bee fly by, remember that it belongs to a complex network of matchmakers critical to the love lives of plants all around you.

**Transcript**:
Bees are very busy little matchmakers. Wingmen in every sense of the word. You see, the bees' side of the whole "birds and the bees" business is to help plants find mates and reproduce. In their work as pollinators, honeybees are integral to the production of nearly 1/3 of the food that we eat. And these bees, dutifully helping lonely plants have sex, aren't alone. But rather are part of a very complex network of matchmaking creatures, critical for the pollination of natural ecosystems and crops. Plants in many natural ecosystems need help to have sex. Like many of us, they're too busy to find a relationship. They have too much photosynthesis to do, and they can't find the time to evolve feet and walk to a singles bar. Those places are called meat markets for a reason, because plants can't walk. So they need matchmaker pollinators to transport their pollen grains to flowers of the same plant species, and they pay these pollinators with food. Today, around 170,000 plant species receive pollination services from more than 200,000 pollinator species. Pollinators include many species of bees, butterflies, moths, flies, wasps, beetles, even birds and bats, who together help pollinate many species of trees, shrubs and other flowering plants. In return, flowering plants are an abundant and diverse food source for pollinators. For instance, fossil records suggest bees may have evolved from wasps that gave up hunting after they acquired a taste for nectar. Plant pollinator networks are everywhere. Ecologists record these networks in the field by observing which pollinators visit which plants, or by analyzing the identity of pollen loads on their bodies. Networks, registered in these ways, contain from 20 to 800 species. These networks show a repeated structure, or architecture. Pollinators interact with plants in a very heterogenous way. Most plants are specialists, they have only one or a few matchmakers. Meanwhile, only a few generalist plants hire a diverse team of matchmakers, getting visits from almost all the pollinators of the network. The same occurs with pollinators. Most are specialists that feed on only a few plant species, while a few pollinators, including the honeybee usually, are generalists, busily feeding from and matchmaking for almost all the plant species in that ecosystem. What's interesting is that specialists and generalists across both plants and pollinators, sort themselves out in a particular pattern. Most pollinator networks, for which we have data, are nested. In a nested network, specialists tend to interact more with generalists than with other specialists. This is because if you're a specialist plant, and your only matchmaker also specializes on you as its only food source, you're each more vulnerable to extinction. So, you're better off specializing on a generalist pollinator that has other sources of food to ensure its persistence in bad years. The same goes if you're a specialist pollinator. You're better off in the long run specializing on a generalist plant that gets pollinated by other species in times when you're not around to help. Finally, in addition to nestedness, the networks are usually modular. This means that the species in a network are compartmentalized into modules of plants and animals that interact more with each other than with species in other modules. Think of them like social cliques. A plant or pollinator dying off will effect the species in its module, but those effects will be less severe on the rest of the network. Why's all that important? Because plant pollinator network structure effects the stability of ecosystems. Heterogeneous distribution, nestedness and modularity enable networks to better prevent and respond to extinctions. That's critical because nature is never static. Some species may not show up every year. Plants flower at different times. Pollinators mature on varying schedules. Generalist pollinators have to adapt their preferences depending on who's flowering when. So from one flowering season to the next, the participants and patterns of matchmaking can drastically change. With all those variables, you can understand the importance of generalist pollinators, like bees, to the stability of not only a crop harvest, but the entire network of plants and pollinators we see in nature, and rely on for life. Next time you see a bee fly by, remember that it belongs to a complex network of matchmakers critical to the love lives of plants all around you.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not match the topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is about plant-pollinator networks. The generated MCQs seem to be related to art, history, and museums.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the structure and format of the question, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match. However, please note that the content and intent of Question 8 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I must conclude that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It's only been the last few hundreds years or so that Western civilization has been putting art in museums, at least museums resembling the public institutions we know today. Before this, for most, art served other purposes. What we call fine art today was, in fact, primarily how people experienced an aesthetic dimension of religion. Paintings, sculpture, textiles and illuminations were the media of their time, supplying vivid imagery to accompany the stories of the day. In this sense, Western art shared a utilitarian purpose with other cultures around the world, some of whose languages incidentally have no word for art. So how do we define what we call art? Generally speaking, what we're talking about here is work that visually communicates meaning beyond language, either through representation or the arrangement of visual elements in space. Evidence of this power of iconography, or ability of images to convey meaning, can be found in abundance if we look at art from the histories of our major world religions. Almost all have, at one time or another in their history, gone through some sort of aniconic phase. Aniconism prohibits any visual depiction of the divine. This is done in order to avoid idolatry, or confusion between the representation of divinity and divinity itself. Keeping it real, so to speak, in the relationship between the individual and the divine. However, this can be a challenge to maintain, given that the urge to visually represent and interpret the world around us is a compulsion difficult to suppress. For example, even today, where the depiction of Allah or the Prophet Muhammad is prohibited, an abstract celebration of the divine can still be found in arabesque patterns of Islamic textile design, with masterful flourishes of brushwork and Arabic calligraphy, where the words of the prophet assume a dual role as both literature and visual art. Likewise, in art from the early periods of Christianity and Buddhism, the divine presence of the Christ and the Buddha do not appear in human form but are represented by symbols. In each case, iconographic reference is employed as a form of reverence. Anthropomorphic representation, or depiction in human form, eventually became widespread in these religions only centuries later, under the influence of the cultural traditions surrounding them. Historically speaking, the public appreciation of visual art in terms other than traditional, religious or social function is a relatively new concept. Today, we fetishize the fetish, so to speak. We go to museums to see art from the ages, but our experience of it there is drastically removed from the context in which it was originally intended to be seen. It might be said that the modern viewer lacks the richness of engagement that she has with contemporary art, which has been created relevant to her time and speaks her cultural language. It might also be said that the history of what we call art is a conversation that continues on, as our contemporary present passes into what will be some future generation's classical past. It's a conversation that reflects the ideologies, mythologies, belief systems and taboos and so much more of the world in which it was made. But this is not to say that work from another age made to serve a particular function in that time is dead or has nothing to offer the modern viewer. Even though in a museum setting works of art from different places and times are presented alongside each other, isolated from their original settings, their juxtaposition has benefits. Exhibits are organized by curators, or people who've made a career out of their ability to recontextualize or remix cultural artifacts in a collective presentation. As viewers, we're then able to consider the art in terms of a common theme that might not be apparent in a particular work until you see it alongside another, and new meanings can be derived and reflected upon. If we're so inclined, we might even start to see every work of art as a complementary part of some undefined, unified whole of past human experience, a trail that leads right to our doorstep and continues on with us, open to anyone who wants to explore it.

It might also be said that the history of what we call art is a conversation that continues on, as our contemporary present passes into what will be some future generation's classical past. It's a conversation that reflects the ideologies, mythologies, belief systems and taboos and so much more of the world in which it was made. But this is not to say that work from another age made to serve a particular function in that time is dead or has nothing to offer the modern viewer. Even though in a museum setting works of art from different places and times are presented alongside each other, isolated from their original settings, their juxtaposition has benefits. Exhibits are organized by curators, or people who've made a career out of their ability to recontextualize or remix cultural artifacts in a collective presentation. As viewers, we're then able to consider the art in terms of a common theme that might not be apparent in a particular work until you see it alongside another, and new meanings can be derived and reflected upon. If we're so inclined, we might even start to see every work of art as a complementary part of some undefined, unified whole of past human experience, a trail that leads right to our doorstep and continues on with us, open to anyone who wants to explore it.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, such as news dissemination and verification, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about the definition of a curator in the context of art and museums.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match. However, the content and intent of Question 8 are still quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would not recommend matching any of the generated MCQs with the ground truth MCQ. Instead, I would suggest generating new MCQs that are more relevant to the topic of art and museums.

Index: None (or Question 8, but with a note that it's not a good match)

**Transcript**:
One of the most remarkable aspects
of the human brain is its ability to recognize patterns
and describe them. Among the hardest patterns
we've tried to understand is the concept of
turbulent flow in fluid dynamics. The German physicist
Werner Heisenberg said, "When I meet God,
I'm going to ask him two questions: why relativity and why turbulence? I really believe he will have
an answer for the first." As difficult as turbulence is
to understand mathematically, we can use art to depict the way it looks. In June 1889, Vincent van Gogh
painted the view just before sunrise from the window of his room
at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he'd admitted himself after
mutilating his own ear in a psychotic episode. In "The Starry Night,"
his circular brushstrokes create a night sky filled
with swirling clouds and eddies of stars. Van Gogh and other Impressionists
represented light in a different way than their predecessors, seeming to capture
its motion, for instance, across sun-dappled waters, or here in star light
that twinkles and melts through milky waves of blue night sky. The effect is caused by luminance, the intensity of the light
in the colors on the canvas. The more primitive part
of our visual cortex, which sees light contrast
and motion, but not color, will blend two differently
colored areas together if they have the same luminance. But our brains' primate subdivision will see the contrasting colors
without blending. With these two interpretations
happening at once, the light in many Impressionist works
seems to pulse, flicker and radiate oddly. That's how this
and other Impressionist works use quickly executed
prominent brushstrokes to capture something strikingly real
about how light moves. Sixty years later, Russian
mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov furthered our mathematical
understanding of turbulence when he proposed that energy
in a turbulent fluid at length R varies in proportion to
the 5/3rds power of R. Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov was remarkably close
to the way turbulent flow works, although a complete description
of turbulence remains one of the unsolved
problems in physics. A turbulent flow is self-similar
if there is an energy cascade. In other words, big eddies
transfer their energy to smaller eddies, which do likewise at other scales. Examples of this include
Jupiter's Great Red Spot, cloud formations
and interstellar dust particles. In 2004, using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists saw the eddies of a distant
cloud of dust and gas around a star, and it reminded them
of Van Gogh's "Starry Night." This motivated scientists
from Mexico, Spain and England to study the luminance
in Van Gogh's paintings in detail. They discovered that there is a distinct
pattern of turbulent fluid structures close to Kolmogorov's equation
hidden in many of Van Gogh's paintings. The researchers digitized the paintings, and measured how brightness varies
between any two pixels. From the curves measured
for pixel separations, they concluded that paintings from
Van Gogh's period of psychotic agitation behave remarkably similar
to fluid turbulence. His self-portrait with a pipe, from
a calmer period in Van Gogh's life, showed no sign of this correspondence. And neither did other artists' work that seemed equally
turbulent at first glance, like Munch's "The Scream." While it's too easy to say
Van Gogh's turbulent genius enabled him to depict turbulence, it's also far too difficult to accurately
express the rousing beauty of the fact that in a period of intense suffering, Van Gogh was somehow
able to perceive and represent one of the most supremely
difficult concepts nature has ever brought before mankind, and to unite his unique mind's eye with the deepest mysteries
of movement, fluid and light.

**Transcript**:
One of the most remarkable aspects
of the human brain is its ability to recognize patterns
and describe them. Among the hardest patterns
we've tried to understand is the concept of
turbulent flow in fluid dynamics. The German physicist
Werner Heisenberg said, "When I meet God,
I'm going to ask him two questions: why relativity and why turbulence? I really believe he will have
an answer for the first." As difficult as turbulence is
to understand mathematically, we can use art to depict the way it looks. In June 1889, Vincent van Gogh
painted the view just before sunrise from the window of his room
at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he'd admitted himself after
mutilating his own ear in a psychotic episode. In "The Starry Night,"
his circular brushstrokes create a night sky filled
with swirling clouds and eddies of stars. Van Gogh and other Impressionists
represented light in a different way than their predecessors, seeming to capture
its motion, for instance, across sun-dappled waters, or here in star light
that twinkles and melts through milky waves of blue night sky. The effect is caused by luminance, the intensity of the light
in the colors on the canvas. The more primitive part
of our visual cortex, which sees light contrast
and motion, but not color, will blend two differently
colored areas together if they have the same luminance. But our brains' primate subdivision will see the contrasting colors
without blending. With these two interpretations
happening at once, the light in many Impressionist works
seems to pulse, flicker and radiate oddly. That's how this
and other Impressionist works use quickly executed
prominent brushstrokes to capture something strikingly real
about how light moves. Sixty years later, Russian
mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov furthered our mathematical
understanding of turbulence when he proposed that energy
in a turbulent fluid at length R varies in proportion to
the 5/3rds power of R. Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov was remarkably close
to the way turbulent flow works, although a complete description
of turbulence remains one of the unsolved
problems in physics. A turbulent flow is self-similar
if there is an energy cascade. In other words, big eddies
transfer their energy to smaller eddies, which do likewise at other scales. Examples of this include
Jupiter's Great Red Spot, cloud formations
and interstellar dust particles. In 2004, using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists saw the eddies of a distant
cloud of dust and gas around a star, and it reminded them
of Van Gogh's "Starry Night." This motivated scientists
from Mexico, Spain and England to study the luminance
in Van Gogh's paintings in detail. They discovered that there is a distinct
pattern of turbulent fluid structures close to Kolmogorov's equation
hidden in many of Van Gogh's paintings. The researchers digitized the paintings, and measured how brightness varies
between any two pixels. From the curves measured
for pixel separations, they concluded that paintings from
Van Gogh's period of psychotic agitation behave remarkably similar
to fluid turbulence. His self-portrait with a pipe, from
a calmer period in Van Gogh's life, showed no sign of this correspondence. And neither did other artists' work that seemed equally
turbulent at first glance, like Munch's "The Scream." While it's too easy to say
Van Gogh's turbulent genius enabled him to depict turbulence, it's also far too difficult to accurately
express the rousing beauty of the fact that in a period of intense suffering, Van Gogh was somehow
able to perceive and represent one of the most supremely
difficult concepts nature has ever brought before mankind, and to unite his unique mind's eye with the deepest mysteries
of movement, fluid and light.

**Transcript**:
Would mathematics exist if people didn't? Since ancient times, 
mankind has hotly debated whether mathematics 
was discovered or invented. Did we create mathematical concepts to
help us understand the universe around us, or is math the native language of
the universe itself, existing whether we find 
its truths or not? Are numbers, polygons 
and equations truly real, or merely ethereal representations
of some theoretical ideal? The independent reality of math has
some ancient advocates. The Pythagoreans of 5th Century Greece
believed numbers were both living entities and universal principles. They called the number one, "the monad,"
the generator of all other numbers and source of all creation. Numbers were active agents in nature. Plato argued mathematical 
concepts were concrete and as real as the universe itself,
regardless of our knowledge of them. Euclid, the father of geometry, believed
nature itself was the physical manifestation
of mathematical laws. Others argue that while numbers may
or may not exist physically, mathematical statements definitely don't. Their truth values are based on rules
that humans created. Mathematics is thus an invented
logic exercise, with no existence outside mankind's
conscious thought, a language of abstract relationships
based on patterns discerned by brains, built to use those patterns to invent
useful but artificial order from chaos. One proponent of this sort of idea
was Leopold Kronecker, a professor of mathematics in 
19th century Germany. His belief is summed up in 
his famous statement: "God created the natural numbers,
all else is the work of man." During mathematician
David Hilbert's lifetime, there was a push to establish mathematics
as a logical construct. Hilbert attempted to axiomatize all
of mathematics, as Euclid had done with geometry. He and others who attempted this saw
mathematics as a deeply philosophical game but a game nonetheless. Henri Poincaré, one of the father's of
non-Euclidean geometry, believed that the existence of 
non-Euclidean geometry, dealing with the non-flat surfaces of 
hyperbolic and elliptical curvatures, proved that Euclidean geometry, the
long standing geometry of flat surfaces, was not a universal truth, but rather one outcome of using one
particular set of game rules. But in 1960, Nobel Physics laureate
Eugene Wigner coined the phrase, "the unreasonable 
effectiveness of mathematics," pushing strongly for the idea that
mathematics is real and discovered by people. Wigner pointed out that many purely
mathematical theories developed in a vacuum, often with no view
towards describing any physical phenomena, have proven decades 
or even centuries later, to be the framework necessary to explain how the universe
has been working all along. For instance, the number theory of British
mathematician Gottfried Hardy, who had boasted that none of his work
would ever be found useful in describing any phenomena
in the real world, helped establish cryptography. Another piece of his purely
theoretical work became known as the Hardy-Weinberg
law in genetics, and won a Nobel prize. And Fibonacci stumbled 
upon his famous sequence while looking at the growth of an 
idealized rabbit population. Mankind later found the sequence
everywhere in nature, from sunflower seeds
and flower petal arrangements, to the structure of a pineapple, even the branching of bronchi
in the lungs. Or there's the non-Euclidean work of
Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s, which Einstein used in the model for
general relativity a century later. Here's an even bigger jump: mathematical knot theory, first developed
around 1771 to describe the geometry of position, was used in the late 20th century
to explain how DNA unravels itself during the replication process. It may even provide key explanations
for string theory. Some of the most influential 
mathematicians and scientists of all of human history
have chimed in on the issue as well, often in surprising ways. So, is mathematics an 
invention or a discovery? Artificial construct or
universal truth? Human product or
natural, possibly divine, creation? These questions are so deep the debate
often becomes spiritual in nature. The answer might depend on the specific
concept being looked at, but it can all feel like a
distorted zen koan. If there's a number of trees in a forest,
but no one's there to count them, does that number exist?

hyperbolic and elliptical curvatures, proved that Euclidean geometry, the
long standing geometry of flat surfaces, was not a universal truth, but rather one outcome of using one
particular set of game rules. But in 1960, Nobel Physics laureate
Eugene Wigner coined the phrase, "the unreasonable 
effectiveness of mathematics," pushing strongly for the idea that
mathematics is real and discovered by people. Wigner pointed out that many purely
mathematical theories developed in a vacuum, often with no view
towards describing any physical phenomena, have proven decades 
or even centuries later, to be the framework necessary to explain how the universe
has been working all along. For instance, the number theory of British
mathematician Gottfried Hardy, who had boasted that none of his work
would ever be found useful in describing any phenomena
in the real world, helped establish cryptography. Another piece of his purely
theoretical work became known as the Hardy-Weinberg
law in genetics, and won a Nobel prize. And Fibonacci stumbled 
upon his famous sequence while looking at the growth of an 
idealized rabbit population. Mankind later found the sequence
everywhere in nature, from sunflower seeds
and flower petal arrangements, to the structure of a pineapple, even the branching of bronchi
in the lungs. Or there's the non-Euclidean work of
Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s, which Einstein used in the model for
general relativity a century later. Here's an even bigger jump: mathematical knot theory, first developed
around 1771 to describe the geometry of position, was used in the late 20th century
to explain how DNA unravels itself during the replication process. It may even provide key explanations
for string theory. Some of the most influential 
mathematicians and scientists of all of human history
have chimed in on the issue as well, often in surprising ways. So, is mathematics an 
invention or a discovery? Artificial construct or
universal truth? Human product or
natural, possibly divine, creation? These questions are so deep the debate
often becomes spiritual in nature. The answer might depend on the specific
concept being looked at, but it can all feel like a
distorted zen koan. If there's a number of trees in a forest,
but no one's there to count them, does that number exist?

**Transcript**:
Would mathematics exist if people didn't? Since ancient times, 
mankind has hotly debated whether mathematics 
was discovered or invented. Did we create mathematical concepts to
help us understand the universe around us, or is math the native language of
the universe itself, existing whether we find 
its truths or not? Are numbers, polygons 
and equations truly real, or merely ethereal representations
of some theoretical ideal? The independent reality of math has
some ancient advocates. The Pythagoreans of 5th Century Greece
believed numbers were both living entities and universal principles. They called the number one, "the monad,"
the generator of all other numbers and source of all creation. Numbers were active agents in nature. Plato argued mathematical 
concepts were concrete and as real as the universe itself,
regardless of our knowledge of them. Euclid, the father of geometry, believed
nature itself was the physical manifestation
of mathematical laws. Others argue that while numbers may
or may not exist physically, mathematical statements definitely don't. Their truth values are based on rules
that humans created. Mathematics is thus an invented
logic exercise, with no existence outside mankind's
conscious thought, a language of abstract relationships
based on patterns discerned by brains, built to use those patterns to invent
useful but artificial order from chaos. One proponent of this sort of idea
was Leopold Kronecker, a professor of mathematics in 
19th century Germany. His belief is summed up in 
his famous statement: "God created the natural numbers,
all else is the work of man." During mathematician
David Hilbert's lifetime, there was a push to establish mathematics
as a logical construct. Hilbert attempted to axiomatize all
of mathematics, as Euclid had done with geometry. He and others who attempted this saw
mathematics as a deeply philosophical game but a game nonetheless. Henri Poincaré, one of the father's of
non-Euclidean geometry, believed that the existence of 
non-Euclidean geometry, dealing with the non-flat surfaces of 
hyperbolic and elliptical curvatures, proved that Euclidean geometry, the
long standing geometry of flat surfaces, was not a universal truth, but rather one outcome of using one
particular set of game rules. But in 1960, Nobel Physics laureate
Eugene Wigner coined the phrase, "the unreasonable 
effectiveness of mathematics," pushing strongly for the idea that

**Transcript**:
We usually think of rhythm
as an element of music, but it's actually found everywhere in
the world around us, from the ocean tides
to our own heartbeats, rhythm is essentially an event repeating
regularly over time. Even the ticking of a clock itself
is a sort of rhythm. But for musical rhythm, a steady string of repeating single
beats is not enough. For that, we need at least one opposing
beat with a different sound, which can be the unstressed off beat
or the accented back beat. There are several ways to make
these beats distinct, whether by using high and low drums,
or long and short beats. Which ends up being heard as the main
beat is not a precise rule, but like the famous Rubin's vase, can be
reversed depending on cultural perception. In standard notation, rhythm is indicated
on a musical bar line, but there are other ways. Remember that ticking clock? Just as its round face can trace the
linear passage of time, the flow of rhythm can be 
traced in a circle. The continuity of a wheel can be
a more intuitive way to visualize rhythm than a linear score that requires moving
back and forth along the page. We can mark the beats at different
positions around the circle using blue dots for main beats,
orange ones for off beats, and white dots for secondary beats. Here is a basic two beat rhythm with
a main beat and an opposing off beat. Or a three beat rhythm with a main beat,
an off beat, and a secondary beat. And the spaces between each beat
can be divided into further sub-beats using multiples of either two or three. Layering multiple patterns using
concentric wheels lets us create more complex rhythms. For example, we can combine a basic 
two beat rhythm with off beats to get a four beat system. This is the recognizable backbone of
many genres popular around the world, from rock, country, and jazz, to reggae and cumbia. Or we can combine a two beat
rhythm with a three beat one. Eliminating the extra main beat
and rotating the inner wheel leaves us with a rhythm whose 
underlying feel is three-four. This is the basis of the music of
Whirling Dervishes, as well as a broad range of 
Latin American rhythms, such as Joropo, and even Bach's famous Chaconne. Now if we remember Rubin's vase
and hear the off beats as the main beats, this will give us a six-eight feel, as found in genres such as Chacarera, and Quechua, Persian music and more. In an eight beat system,
we have three layered circles, each rhythm played by 
a different instrument. We can then add an outermost layer consisting of an additive 
rhythmic component, reinforcing the main beat
and increasing accuracy. Now let's remove everything
except for this combined rhythm and the basic two beat on top. This rhythmic configuration is found
as the Cuban cinquillo, in the Puerto Rican bomba, and in Northern Romanian music. And rotating the outer circle
90 degrees counterclockwise gives us a pattern often found
in Middle Eastern music, as well as Brazilian choro, and Argentinian tango. In all of these examples, the underlying
rhythm reinforces the basic one-two, but in different ways depending on 
arrangement and cultural context. So it turns out that the wheel method
is more than just a nifty way of visualizing complex rhythms. By freeing us from the tyranny
of the bar line, we can visualize rhythm 
in terms of time, and a simple turn of the wheel can take us
on a musical journey around the world.

**Transcript**:
We usually think of rhythm
as an element of music, but it's actually found everywhere in
the world around us, from the ocean tides
to our own heartbeats, rhythm is essentially an event repeating
regularly over time. Even the ticking of a clock itself
is a sort of rhythm. But for musical rhythm, a steady string of repeating single
beats is not enough. For that, we need at least one opposing
beat with a different sound, which can be the unstressed off beat
or the accented back beat. There are several ways to make
these beats distinct, whether by using high and low drums,
or long and short beats. Which ends up being heard as the main
beat is not a precise rule, but like the famous Rubin's vase, can be
reversed depending on cultural perception. In standard notation, rhythm is indicated
on a musical bar line, but there are other ways. Remember that ticking clock? Just as its round face can trace the
linear passage of time, the flow of rhythm can be 
traced in a circle. The continuity of a wheel can be
a more intuitive way to visualize rhythm than a linear score that requires moving
back and forth along the page. We can mark the beats at different
positions around the circle using blue dots for main beats,
orange ones for off beats, and white dots for secondary beats. Here is a basic two beat rhythm with
a main beat and an opposing off beat. Or a three beat rhythm with a main beat,
an off beat, and a secondary beat. And the spaces between each beat
can be divided into further sub-beats using multiples of either two or three. Layering multiple patterns using
concentric wheels lets us create more complex rhythms. For example, we can combine a basic 
two beat rhythm with off beats to get a four beat system. This is the recognizable backbone of
many genres popular around the world, from rock, country, and jazz, to reggae and cumbia. Or we can combine a two beat
rhythm with a three beat one. Eliminating the extra main beat
and rotating the inner wheel leaves us with a rhythm whose 
underlying feel is three-four. This is the basis of the music of
Whirling Dervishes, as well as a broad range of 
Latin American rhythms, such as Joropo, and even Bach's famous Chaconne. Now if we remember Rubin's vase
and hear the off beats as the main beats, this will give us a six-eight feel, as found in genres such as Chacarera, and Quechua, Persian music and more. In an eight beat system,
we have three layered circles, each rhythm played by 
a different instrument. We can then add an outermost layer consisting of an additive 
rhythmic component, reinforcing the main beat
and increasing accuracy. Now let's remove everything
except for this combined rhythm and the basic two beat on top. This rhythmic configuration is found
as the Cuban cinquillo, in the Puerto Rican bomba, and in Northern Romanian music. And rotating the outer circle
90 degrees counterclockwise gives us a pattern often found
in Middle Eastern music, as well as Brazilian choro, and Argentinian tango. In all of these examples, the underlying
rhythm reinforces the basic one-two, but in different ways depending on 
arrangement and cultural context. So it turns out that the wheel method
is more than just a nifty way of visualizing complex rhythms. By freeing us from the tyranny
of the bar line, we can visualize rhythm 
in terms of time, and a simple turn of the wheel can take us
on a musical journey around the world.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The city sky is, frankly, rather boring. If you look up at the patches of
murk between buildings, you might be able to pick out
The Big Dipper, or perhaps, Orion's Belt. But hold on.  Look at that murky patch again
and hold our your thumb. How many stars do you think
are behind it? Ten, twenty? Guess again. If you looked at that
thumbnail-sized patch of sky with the Hubble Space Telescope, instead of points of light,
you'd see smudges. These aren't stars. They're galaxies, just like our Milky Way. Cities of billions of stars, and more than 1,000 of them
are hidden behind your thumb. The universe is bigger than
you can see from the city, and even bigger than the starry sky
you can see from the countryside. This is the universe as 
astrophysicists see it, with more stars than all the grains
of sand on Earth. By staring up at the stars at night, you've taken part in the oldest science
in human history. The study of the heavens is older than navigation, agriculture, perhaps
even language itself. Yet unlike other sciences,
astronomy is purely observational. We cannot control the parameters
of our experiments from lab benches. Our best technology can send
man to the moon, and probes to the edge of 
the solar system. But these distances are vanishingly small compared to the yawning gulfs 
between stars. So how can we know so much
about other galaxies, what they're made of, how many there are,
or that they're even there at all? Well, we can start with the first thing we
see when we look up at night: the stars. What we are trying to learn
is their properties. What are they made of? How hot are they?
How massive? How old? How far are they from Earth? And believe it or not, we can learn all of these things
simply from the light shining in the sky. We can decipher one kind of stellar message
by turning starlight into rainbows. When you look at a rainbow on Earth, you're really looking at light
from our Sun being scattered through water droplets
in the atmosphere into all the different wavelengths
that make it up. And we study the light from other stars, we can create rainbows on demand
using not water droplets, but other specific instruments that
disperse light. When we look at the scattered
light from our sun, we see something strange:
dark lines in our rainbow. These lines are the characteristic
fingerprints of atoms. Each type of atom in the solar atmosphere
soaks up light at specific wavelengths, and the amount of absorption depends on
how many of these atoms there are. So by observing how much light is missing
at these characteristic wavelengths, we can tell not only what elements are
in the Sun's atmosphere, but even their concentrations. And the same idea can be applied to
study other stars. Make a spectral rainbow, 
see what's missing, and figure out which elements are present. Bingo. Now you know what stars
are made of. But we aren't restricted to just
the wavelengths that our eyes perceive. Consider radio waves. Yes, they can bring the Billboard Top 100
to your car, but they can also travel almost
unimpeded through space. Because they've come so far, radio waves can tell us the very
early history of the universe, from just a few thousand years
after The Big Bang. We can also study the infrared light,
emitted by colder objects, like the gas and dust clouds in space, and the ultraviolet light from the hot
stars recently born from those clouds. Studying different wavelengths 
not only gives us a more complete picture
of any single object but also different views of the universe. For this reason, astrophysicists use
several different kinds of telescopes covering the spectrum from the infrared
to the ultraviolet to the X-ray, from giant radio dishes to giant
silver mirrors to space satellites, detecting light that would be otherwise
blocked by the Earth's atmosphere. Astrophysicists don't just see the billions of stars among
the billions of galaxies in the universe. They hear, feel and sense them
through many channels, each revealing a different story. But it all begins with light,
the kind we can see and the kind we can't. Want to know the secrets of the Universe? Just follow the light.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why does the night sky look rather empty in cities?

at these characteristic wavelengths, we can tell not only what elements are
in the Sun's atmosphere, but even their concentrations. And the same idea can be applied to
study other stars. Make a spectral rainbow, 
see what's missing, and figure out which elements are present. Bingo. Now you know what stars
are made of. But we aren't restricted to just
the wavelengths that our eyes perceive. Consider radio waves. Yes, they can bring the Billboard Top 100
to your car, but they can also travel almost
unimpeded through space. Because they've come so far, radio waves can tell us the very
early history of the universe, from just a few thousand years
after The Big Bang. We can also study the infrared light,
emitted by colder objects, like the gas and dust clouds in space, and the ultraviolet light from the hot
stars recently born from those clouds. Studying different wavelengths 
not only gives us a more complete picture
of any single object but also different views of the universe. For this reason, astrophysicists use
several different kinds of telescopes covering the spectrum from the infrared
to the ultraviolet to the X-ray, from giant radio dishes to giant
silver mirrors to space satellites, detecting light that would be otherwise
blocked by the Earth's atmosphere. Astrophysicists don't just see the billions of stars among
the billions of galaxies in the universe. They hear, feel and sense them
through many channels, each revealing a different story. But it all begins with light,
the kind we can see and the kind we can't. Want to know the secrets of the Universe? Just follow the light.

**Transcript**:
The city sky is, frankly, rather boring. If you look up at the patches of
murk between buildings, you might be able to pick out
The Big Dipper, or perhaps, Orion's Belt. But hold on.  Look at that murky patch again
and hold our your thumb. How many stars do you think
are behind it? Ten, twenty? Guess again. If you looked at that
thumbnail-sized patch of sky with the Hubble Space Telescope, instead of points of light,
you'd see smudges. These aren't stars. They're galaxies, just like our Milky Way. Cities of billions of stars, and more than 1,000 of them
are hidden behind your thumb. The universe is bigger than
you can see from the city, and even bigger than the starry sky
you can see from the countryside. This is the universe as 
astrophysicists see it, with more stars than all the grains
of sand on Earth. By staring up at the stars at night, you've taken part in the oldest science
in human history. The study of the heavens is older than navigation, agriculture, perhaps
even language itself. Yet unlike other sciences,
astronomy is purely observational. We cannot control the parameters
of our experiments from lab benches. Our best technology can send
man to the moon, and probes to the edge of 
the solar system. But these distances are vanishingly small compared to the yawning gulfs 
between stars. So how can we know so much
about other galaxies, what they're made of, how many there are,
or that they're even there at all? Well, we can start with the first thing we
see when we look up at night: the stars. What we are trying to learn
is their properties. What are they made of? How hot are they?
How massive? How old? How far are they from Earth? And believe it or not, we can learn all of these things
simply from the light shining in the sky. We can decipher one kind of stellar message
by turning starlight into rainbows. When you look at a rainbow on Earth, you're really looking at light
from our Sun being scattered through water droplets
in the atmosphere into all the different wavelengths
that make it up. And we study the light from other stars, we can create rainbows on demand
using not water droplets, but other specific instruments that
disperse light. When we look at the scattered
light from our sun, we see something strange:
dark lines in our rainbow. These lines are the characteristic
fingerprints of atoms. Each type of atom in the solar atmosphere
soaks up light at specific wavelengths, and the amount of absorption depends on
how many of these atoms there are. So by observing how much light is missing
at these characteristic wavelengths, we can tell not only what elements are
in the Sun's atmosphere, but even their concentrations. And the same idea can be applied to

**Transcript**:
How many times does the chorus repeat
in your favorite song? And, take a moment to think,
how many times have you listened to it? Chances are you've heard that chorus
repeated dozens, if not hundreds, of times, and it's not just popular songs in the West
that repeat a lot. Repetition is a feature that music from
cultures around the world tends to share. So, why does music rely
so heavily on repetition? One part of the answer come from what
psychologists call the mere-exposure effect. In short, people tend to prefer things
they've been exposed to before. For example, a song comes on the radio
that we don't particularly like, but then we hear the song at
the grocery store, at the movie theater and again on the street corner. Soon, we are tapping to the beat,
singing the words, even downloading the track. This mere-exposure effect doesn't
just work for songs. It also works for everything 
from shapes to Super Bowl ads. So, what makes repetition so
uniquely prevalent in music? To investigate, psychologists asked
people to listen to musical compositions that avoided exact repetition. They heard excerpts from these pieces
in either their original form, or in a version that had been digitally
altered to include repetition. Although the original versions
had been composed by some of the most respected 
20th century composers, and the repetitive versions had been
assembled by brute force audio editing, people rated the repetitive versions
as more enjoyable, more interesting and more likely to have been
composed by a human artist. Musical repetition is deeply compelling. Think about the Muppets classic,
"Mahna Mahna." If you've heard it before, it's almost impossible after I sing,
"Mahna mahna," not to respond, "Do doo do do do." Repetition connects each bit of music irresistibly to the next bit 
of music that follows it. So when you hear a few notes,
you're already imagining what's coming next. Your mind is unconsciously singing along, and without noticing,
you might start humming out loud. Recent studies have shown that when
people hear a segment of music repeated, they are more likely to move
or tap along to it. Repetition invites us into music
as imagined participants, rather than as passive listeners. Research has also shown that listeners shift their attention
across musical repetitions, focusing on different aspects of
the sound on each new listen. You might notice the melody
of a phrase the first time, but when it's repeated, your attention
shifts to how the guitarist bends a pitch. This also occurs in language,
with something called semantic satiation. Repeating a word like atlas ad nauseam can make you stop thinking about 
what the word means, and instead focus on the sounds:
the odd way the "L" follows the "T." In this way, repetition can 
open up new worlds of sound not accessible on first hearing. The "L" following the "T" might not be
aesthetically relevant to "atlas," but the guitarist pitch bending
might be of critical expressive importance. The speech to song illusion
captures how simply repeating a sentence a number of times
shifts listeners attention to the pitch and temporal
aspects of the sound, so that the repeated spoken language actually begins to sound
like it is being sung. A similar effect happens with 
random sequences of sound. People will rate random sequences
they've heard on repeated loop as more musical than a random
sequence they've only heard once. Repetition gives rise to a kind of
orientation to sound that we think of as distinctively musical,
where we're listening along with the sound, engaging imaginatively with the note
about to happen. This mode of listening ties in with our
susceptibility to musical ear worms, where segments of music
burrow into our head, and play again and again,
as if stuck on repeat. Critics are often embarrassed
by music's repetitiveness, finding it childish or regressive, but repetition, far from an embarrassment,
is actually a key feature that gives rise to the kind of experience
we think about as musical.

**Transcript**:
How many times does the chorus repeat
in your favorite song? And, take a moment to think,
how many times have you listened to it? Chances are you've heard that chorus
repeated dozens, if not hundreds, of times, and it's not just popular songs in the West
that repeat a lot. Repetition is a feature that music from
cultures around the world tends to share. So, why does music rely
so heavily on repetition? One part of the answer come from what
psychologists call the mere-exposure effect. In short, people tend to prefer things
they've been exposed to before. For example, a song comes on the radio
that we don't particularly like, but then we hear the song at
the grocery store, at the movie theater and again on the street corner. Soon, we are tapping to the beat,
singing the words, even downloading the track. This mere-exposure effect doesn't
just work for songs. It also works for everything 
from shapes to Super Bowl ads. So, what makes repetition so
uniquely prevalent in music? To investigate, psychologists asked
people to listen to musical compositions that avoided exact repetition. They heard excerpts from these pieces
in either their original form, or in a version that had been digitally
altered to include repetition. Although the original versions
had been composed by some of the most respected 
20th century composers, and the repetitive versions had been
assembled by brute force audio editing, people rated the repetitive versions
as more enjoyable, more interesting and more likely to have been
composed by a human artist. Musical repetition is deeply compelling. Think about the Muppets classic,
"Mahna Mahna." If you've heard it before, it's almost impossible after I sing,
"Mahna mahna," not to respond, "Do doo do do do." Repetition connects each bit of music irresistibly to the next bit 
of music that follows it. So when you hear a few notes,
you're already imagining what's coming next. Your mind is unconsciously singing along, and without noticing,
you might start humming out loud. Recent studies have shown that when
people hear a segment of music repeated, they are more likely to move
or tap along to it. Repetition invites us into music
as imagined participants, rather than as passive listeners. Research has also shown that listeners shift their attention
across musical repetitions, focusing on different aspects of
the sound on each new listen. You might notice the melody
of a phrase the first time, but when it's repeated, your attention
shifts to how the guitarist bends a pitch. This also occurs in language,
with something called semantic satiation. Repeating a word like atlas ad nauseam can make you stop thinking about 
what the word means, and instead focus on the sounds:
the odd way the "L" follows the "T." In this way, repetition can 
open up new worlds of sound not accessible on first hearing. The "L" following the "T" might not be
aesthetically relevant to "atlas," but the guitarist pitch bending
might be of critical expressive importance. The speech to song illusion
captures how simply repeating a sentence a number of times
shifts listeners attention to the pitch and temporal
aspects of the sound, so that the repeated spoken language actually begins to sound
like it is being sung. A similar effect happens with 
random sequences of sound. People will rate random sequences
they've heard on repeated loop as more musical than a random
sequence they've only heard once. Repetition gives rise to a kind of
orientation to sound that we think of as distinctively musical,
where we're listening along with the sound, engaging imaginatively with the note
about to happen. This mode of listening ties in with our
susceptibility to musical ear worms, where segments of music
burrow into our head, and play again and again,
as if stuck on repeat. Critics are often embarrassed
by music's repetitiveness, finding it childish or regressive, but repetition, far from an embarrassment,
is actually a key feature that gives rise to the kind of experience
we think about as musical.

**Transcript**:
Diabetes mellitus has been a scourge
of the developed world with an estimated 400,000,000 people
worldwide suffering from this disease, and 50% more predicted
within twenty years. Its early symptoms, which include increased thirst
and large volumes of urine, were recognized as far back
as 1500 BCE in Egypt. While the term diabetes,
meaning "to pass through," was first used in 250 BCE by the Greek physician
Apollonius of Memphis, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, associated respectively
with youth and obesity, were identified as separate conditions by Indian physicians
somewhere in the 5th century CE. But despite the disease being known, a diagnosis of diabetes in a human patient would remain tantamount
to a death sentence until the early 20th century,
its causes unknown. What changed this dire situation was the help of humanity's
longtime animal partner: Canis lupus familiaris, domesticated from Grey wolves
thousands of years ago. In 1890, the German scientists
Von Mering and Minkowski demonstrated that removing
a dog's pancreas caused it to develop
all the signs of diabetes, thus establishing the organ's
central role in the disease. But the exact mechanism
by which this occurred remained a mystery until 1920, when a young Canadian surgeon
named Frederick Banting and his student, Charles Best, advanced the findings
of their German colleagues. Working under Professor Macleod
at the University of Toronto, they confirmed that the pancreas was
responsible for regulating blood glucose, successfully treating diabetic dogs
by injecting them with an extract they had prepared from pancreas tissue. By 1922, the researchers working
with biochemist James Collip were able to develop a similar extract
from beef pancreas to first treat a 14-year-old diabetic boy, followed by six additional patients. The manufacturing process
for this extract, now known as insulin, was eventually turned over
to a pharmaceutical company that makes different types
of injectable insulin to this day. Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize for Medicine
in 1923 for their discovery. But Banting chose to share
his portion with Charles Best, for his help in the initial
studies involving dogs. But while medical experimentation
on animals remains controversial, in this case at least, it was not just a matter
of exploiting dogs for human needs. Dogs develop diabetes at the rate
of two cases per 1,000 dogs, almost the same
as that of humans under 20. Most canine cases are of Type 1 diabetes, similar to the type
that young children develop following immune system
destruction of the pancreas, and genetic studies have shown that the dog disease has many
similar hallmarks of the human disease. This has allowed veterinarians
to turn the tables, successfully using insulin
to treat diabetes in man's best friend for over 60 years. Many dog owners commit
to managing their dogs' diabetes with insulin injected twice daily,
regimented feedings, and periodic blood measurements using the same home-testing
glucose monitors used by human patients. And if the purified pig insulin
commonly used for dogs fails to work for a particular dog, the vet may even turn
to a formulation of human insulin, bringing the process full circle. After all that dogs have done
for us throughout the ages, including their role
in a medical discovery that has saved countless human lives, using that same knowledge
to help them is the least we could do.

by which this occurred remained a mystery until 1920, when a young Canadian surgeon
named Frederick Banting and his student, Charles Best, advanced the findings
of their German colleagues. Working under Professor Macleod
at the University of Toronto, they confirmed that the pancreas was
responsible for regulating blood glucose, successfully treating diabetic dogs
by injecting them with an extract they had prepared from pancreas tissue. By 1922, the researchers working
with biochemist James Collip were able to develop a similar extract
from beef pancreas to first treat a 14-year-old diabetic boy, followed by six additional patients. The manufacturing process
for this extract, now known as insulin, was eventually turned over
to a pharmaceutical company that makes different types
of injectable insulin to this day. Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize for Medicine
in 1923 for their discovery. But Banting chose to share
his portion with Charles Best, for his help in the initial
studies involving dogs. But while medical experimentation
on animals remains controversial, in this case at least, it was not just a matter
of exploiting dogs for human needs. Dogs develop diabetes at the rate
of two cases per 1,000 dogs, almost the same
as that of humans under 20. Most canine cases are of Type 1 diabetes, similar to the type
that young children develop following immune system
destruction of the pancreas, and genetic studies have shown that the dog disease has many
similar hallmarks of the human disease. This has allowed veterinarians
to turn the tables, successfully using insulin
to treat diabetes in man's best friend for over 60 years. Many dog owners commit
to managing their dogs' diabetes with insulin injected twice daily,
regimented feedings, and periodic blood measurements using the same home-testing
glucose monitors used by human patients. And if the purified pig insulin
commonly used for dogs fails to work for a particular dog, the vet may even turn
to a formulation of human insulin, bringing the process full circle. After all that dogs have done
for us throughout the ages, including their role
in a medical discovery that has saved countless human lives, using that same knowledge
to help them is the least we could do.

**Transcript**:
Diabetes mellitus has been a scourge
of the developed world with an estimated 400,000,000 people
worldwide suffering from this disease, and 50% more predicted
within twenty years. Its early symptoms, which include increased thirst
and large volumes of urine, were recognized as far back
as 1500 BCE in Egypt. While the term diabetes,
meaning "to pass through," was first used in 250 BCE by the Greek physician
Apollonius of Memphis, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, associated respectively
with youth and obesity, were identified as separate conditions by Indian physicians
somewhere in the 5th century CE. But despite the disease being known, a diagnosis of diabetes in a human patient would remain tantamount
to a death sentence until the early 20th century,
its causes unknown. What changed this dire situation was the help of humanity's
longtime animal partner: Canis lupus familiaris, domesticated from Grey wolves
thousands of years ago. In 1890, the German scientists
Von Mering and Minkowski demonstrated that removing
a dog's pancreas caused it to develop
all the signs of diabetes, thus establishing the organ's
central role in the disease. But the exact mechanism

**Transcript**:
They call me the tornado chaser. When the wind is up 
and conditions are right, I get in my car and follow violent storms. "Crazy," you say? Perhaps, but really I
chase these sky beasts to learn about them. I want to share with you what I know. Tornadoes are rapidly rotating columns
of air that form inside storms that connect with the ground via
a funnel of cloud. When that happens, 
they tear across the Earth, posing a huge threat to life and property. Because of this, there's a great deal
of research into these phenomena, but the truth is, there's still a lot
we don't know about how tornadoes form. The conditions that may 
give rise to one tornado won't necessarily cause another. But we have learned a lot since
people first started recording tornadoes, like how to recognize the signs
when one is brewing in the sky. Are you coming along for the ride? Tornadoes begin with a thunderstorm
but not just any thunderstorm. These are especially powerful, towering
thunderstorms called supercells. Reaching up to over 50,000 feet,
they bring high force winds, giant hailstones, sometimes flooding
and great flashes of lightning, too. These are the kinds of storms
that breed tornadoes, but only if there are also very
specific conditions in place, clues that we can measure and look out for
when we're trying to forecast a storm. Rising air is the first ingredient needed
for a tornado to develop. Any storm is formed 
when condensation occurs, the byproducts of the clouds. Condensation releases heat, and heat becomes the energy that drives
huge upward drafts of air. The more condensation
and the bigger the storm clouds grow, the more powerful those updrafts become. In supercells, this rising airmass 
is particularly strong. As the air climbs, it can change direction
and start to move more quickly. Finally, at the storm's base,
if there is a lot of moisture, a huge cloud base develops,
giving the tornado something to feed off later,
if it gets that far. When all these things are in place,
a vortex can develop enclosed by the storm, and forming a wide, tall tube of spinning
air that then gets pulled upwards. We call this a mesocyclone. Outside, cool, dry, sinking air starts to wrap around the back of
this mesocyclone, forming what's known as a
rear flank downdraft. This unusual scenario creates 
a stark temperature difference between the air inside the mesocyclone,
and the air outside, building up a level of instability
that allows a tornado to thrive. Then, the mesocyclone's lower part
becomes tighter, increasing the speed of the wind. If, and that's a big if,
this funnel of air moves down into that large, moist cloud base
at the bottom of the parent storm, it sucks it in and turns it 
into a rotating wall of cloud, forming a link between 
the storm that created it and the Earth. The second that tube of
spinning cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado. Most are small and short-lived,
producing winds of 65-110 miles per hour, but others can last for over an hour,
producing 200 mile per hour winds. They are beautiful but terrifying, especially if you or 
your town is in its path. In that case, no one,
not even tornado chasers like me, enjoy watching thing unfold. Just like everything, however,
tornadoes do come to an end. When the temperature difference disappears
and conditions grow more stable, or the moisture in the air dries up, the once fierce parent storm loses
momentum and draws its tornado back inside. Even so, meteorologists and storm chasers
like me will remain on the lookout, watching, always watching to see
if the storm releases its long rope again.

**Transcript**:
They call me the tornado chaser. When the wind is up 
and conditions are right, I get in my car and follow violent storms. "Crazy," you say? Perhaps, but really I
chase these sky beasts to learn about them. I want to share with you what I know. Tornadoes are rapidly rotating columns
of air that form inside storms that connect with the ground via
a funnel of cloud. When that happens, 
they tear across the Earth, posing a huge threat to life and property. Because of this, there's a great deal
of research into these phenomena, but the truth is, there's still a lot
we don't know about how tornadoes form. The conditions that may 
give rise to one tornado won't necessarily cause another. But we have learned a lot since
people first started recording tornadoes, like how to recognize the signs
when one is brewing in the sky. Are you coming along for the ride? Tornadoes begin with a thunderstorm
but not just any thunderstorm. These are especially powerful, towering
thunderstorms called supercells. Reaching up to over 50,000 feet,
they bring high force winds, giant hailstones, sometimes flooding
and great flashes of lightning, too. These are the kinds of storms
that breed tornadoes, but only if there are also very
specific conditions in place, clues that we can measure and look out for
when we're trying to forecast a storm. Rising air is the first ingredient needed
for a tornado to develop. Any storm is formed 
when condensation occurs, the byproducts of the clouds. Condensation releases heat, and heat becomes the energy that drives
huge upward drafts of air. The more condensation
and the bigger the storm clouds grow, the more powerful those updrafts become. In supercells, this rising airmass 
is particularly strong. As the air climbs, it can change direction
and start to move more quickly. Finally, at the storm's base,
if there is a lot of moisture, a huge cloud base develops,
giving the tornado something to feed off later,
if it gets that far. When all these things are in place,
a vortex can develop enclosed by the storm, and forming a wide, tall tube of spinning
air that then gets pulled upwards. We call this a mesocyclone. Outside, cool, dry, sinking air starts to wrap around the back of
this mesocyclone, forming what's known as a
rear flank downdraft. This unusual scenario creates 
a stark temperature difference between the air inside the mesocyclone,
and the air outside, building up a level of instability
that allows a tornado to thrive. Then, the mesocyclone's lower part
becomes tighter, increasing the speed of the wind. If, and that's a big if,
this funnel of air moves down into that large, moist cloud base
at the bottom of the parent storm, it sucks it in and turns it 
into a rotating wall of cloud, forming a link between 
the storm that created it and the Earth. The second that tube of
spinning cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado. Most are small and short-lived,
producing winds of 65-110 miles per hour, but others can last for over an hour,
producing 200 mile per hour winds. They are beautiful but terrifying, especially if you or 
your town is in its path. In that case, no one,
not even tornado chasers like me, enjoy watching thing unfold. Just like everything, however,
tornadoes do come to an end. When the temperature difference disappears
and conditions grow more stable, or the moisture in the air dries up, the once fierce parent storm loses
momentum and draws its tornado back inside. Even so, meteorologists and storm chasers
like me will remain on the lookout, watching, always watching to see
if the storm releases its long rope again.

**Transcript**:
How do you know you're real? It's an obvious question
until you try to answer it, but let's take it seriously. How do you really know you exist? In his "Meditations on First Philosophy," René Descartes tried to answer
that very question, demolishing all his preconceived
notions and opinions to begin again from the foundations. All his knowledge had come
from his sensory perceptions of the world. Same as you, right? You know you're watching this video
with your eyes, hearing it with your ears. Your senses show you the world as it is. They aren't deceiving you,
but sometimes they do. You might mistake a person
far away for someone else, or you're sure you're about
to catch a flyball, and it hits the ground in front of you. But come on, right here and now, you know what's right
in front of you is real. Your eyes, your hands,
your body: that's you. Only crazy people would deny that,
and you know you're not crazy. Anyone who'd doubt that must be dreaming. Oh no, what if you're dreaming? Dreams feel real. You can believe you're swimming, flying or fighting off monsters
with your bare hands, when your real body is lying in bed. No, no, no. When you're awake, you know you're awake. Ah! But when you aren't,
you don't know you aren't, so you can't prove you aren't dreaming. Maybe the body you perceive
yourself to have isn't really there. Maybe all of reality,
even its abstract concepts, like time, shape, color
and number are false, all just deceptions concocted by an evil genius! No, seriously. Descartes asks if you can disprove
the idea that an evil genius demon has tricked you into
believing reality is real. Perhaps this diabolical
deceiver has duped you. The world, your perceptions
of it, your very body. You can't disprove
that they're all just made up, and how could you exist without them? You couldn't! So, you don't. Life is but a dream, and I bet you aren't row, row,
rowing the boat merrily at all, are you? No, you're rowing it wearily like the duped, nonexistent
doof you are/aren't. Do you find that convincing? Are you persuaded? If you aren't, good;
if you are, even better, because by being persuaded, you would prove
that you're a persuaded being. You can't be nothing
if you think you're something, even if you think
that something is nothing because no matter what you think,
you're a thinking thing, or as Descartes put it,
"I think, therefore I am," and so are you, really. (Airplane engine)

**Transcript**:
How do you know you're real? It's an obvious question
until you try to answer it, but let's take it seriously. How do you really know you exist? In his "Meditations on First Philosophy," René Descartes tried to answer
that very question, demolishing all his preconceived
notions and opinions to begin again from the foundations. All his knowledge had come
from his sensory perceptions of the world. Same as you, right? You know you're watching this video
with your eyes, hearing it with your ears. Your senses show you the world as it is. They aren't deceiving you,
but sometimes they do. You might mistake a person
far away for someone else, or you're sure you're about
to catch a flyball, and it hits the ground in front of you. But come on, right here and now, you know what's right
in front of you is real. Your eyes, your hands,
your body: that's you. Only crazy people would deny that,
and you know you're not crazy. Anyone who'd doubt that must be dreaming. Oh no, what if you're dreaming? Dreams feel real. You can believe you're swimming, flying or fighting off monsters
with your bare hands, when your real body is lying in bed. No, no, no. When you're awake, you know you're awake. Ah! But when you aren't,
you don't know you aren't, so you can't prove you aren't dreaming. Maybe the body you perceive
yourself to have isn't really there. Maybe all of reality,
even its abstract concepts, like time, shape, color
and number are false, all just deceptions concocted by an evil genius! No, seriously. Descartes asks if you can disprove
the idea that an evil genius demon has tricked you into
believing reality is real. Perhaps this diabolical
deceiver has duped you. The world, your perceptions
of it, your very body. You can't disprove
that they're all just made up, and how could you exist without them? You couldn't! So, you don't. Life is but a dream, and I bet you aren't row, row,
rowing the boat merrily at all, are you? No, you're rowing it wearily like the duped, nonexistent
doof you are/aren't. Do you find that convincing? Are you persuaded? If you aren't, good;
if you are, even better, because by being persuaded, you would prove
that you're a persuaded being. You can't be nothing
if you think you're something, even if you think
that something is nothing because no matter what you think,
you're a thinking thing, or as Descartes put it,
"I think, therefore I am," and so are you, really. (Airplane engine)

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What if I told you there were trillions
of tiny bacteria all around you? It's true. Microorganisms called bacteria
were some of the first life forms to appear on Earth. Though they consist of only a single cell, their total biomass is greater than
that of all plants and animals combined. And they live virtually everywhere: on the ground, in the water, on your kitchen table, on your skin, even inside you. Don't reach for the panic button just yet. Although you have 10 times
more bacterial cells inside you than your body has human cells, many of these bacteria
are harmless or even beneficial, helping digestion and immunity. But there are a few bad apples
that can cause harmful infections, from minor inconveniences
to deadly epidemics. Fortunately, there are amazing medicines
designed to fight bacterial infections. Synthesized from chemicals or
occurring naturally in things like mold, these antibiotics kill
or neutralize bacteria by interrupting cell wall synthesis or interfering with vital processes
like protein synthesis, all while leaving human cells unharmed. The deployment of antibiotics
over the course of the 20th century has rendered many previously
dangerous diseases easily treatable. But today, more and more
of our antibiotics are becoming less effective. Did something go wrong
to make them stop working? The problem is not with the antibiotics
but the bacteria they were made to fight, and the reason lies in Darwin's theory
of natural selection. Just like any other organisms, individual bacteria
can undergo random mutations. Many of these mutations
are harmful or useless, but every now and then,
one comes along that gives its organism an edge in survival. And for a bacterium, a mutation making it resistant
to a certain antibiotic gives quite the edge. As the non-resistant bacteria
are killed off, which happens especially quickly
in antibiotic-rich environments, like hospitals, there is more room and resources
for the resistant ones to thrive, passing along only the mutated genes
that help them do so. Reproduction
isn't the only way to do this. Some can release their DNA upon death
to be picked up by other bacteria, while others use a method
called conjugation, connecting through pili
to share their genes. Over time, the resistant
genes proliferate, creating entire strains
of resistant super bacteria. So how much time do we have
before these superbugs take over? Well, in some bacteria,
it's already happened. For instance, some strands
of staphylococcus aureus, which causes everything from
skin infections to pneumonia and sepsis, have developed into MRSA, becoming resistant
to beta-lactam antibiotics, like penicillin, methicillin,
and oxacillin. Thanks to a gene that replaces the protein
beta-lactams normally target and bind to, MRSA can keep making
its cell walls unimpeded. Other super bacteria, like salmonella, even sometimes produce enzymes
like beta-lactams that break down antibiotic attackers
before they can do any damage, and E. coli, a diverse group of bacteria that contains strains that cause
diarrhea and kidney failure, can prevent the function of antibiotics, like quinolones, by actively
booting any invaders that manage to enter the cell. But there is good news. Scientists are working to stay
one step ahead of the bacteria, and although development
of new antibiotics has slowed in recent years, the World Health Organization has made it
a priority to develop novel treatments. Other scientists are investigating
alternate solutions, such as phage therapy
or using vaccines to prevent infections. Most importantly, curbing the excessive
and unnecessary use of antibiotics, such as for minor infections
that can resolve on their own, as well as changing medical practice
to prevent hospital infections, can have a major impact by keeping more
non-resistant bacteria alive as competition for resistant strains. In the war against super bacteria,
deescalation may sometimes work better than an evolutionary arms race.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
What if I told you there were trillions
of tiny bacteria all around you? It's true. Microorganisms called bacteria
were some of the first life forms to appear on Earth. Though they consist of only a single cell, their total biomass is greater than
that of all plants and animals combined. And they live virtually everywhere: on the ground, in the water, on your kitchen table, on your skin, even inside you. Don't reach for the panic button just yet. Although you have 10 times
more bacterial cells inside you than your body has human cells, many of these bacteria
are harmless or even beneficial, helping digestion and immunity. But there are a few bad apples
that can cause harmful infections, from minor inconveniences
to deadly epidemics. Fortunately, there are amazing medicines
designed to fight bacterial infections. Synthesized from chemicals or
occurring naturally in things like mold, these antibiotics kill
or neutralize bacteria by interrupting cell wall synthesis or interfering with vital processes
like protein synthesis, all while leaving human cells unharmed. The deployment of antibiotics
over the course of the 20th century has rendered many previously
dangerous diseases easily treatable. But today, more and more
of our antibiotics are becoming less effective. Did something go wrong
to make them stop working? The problem is not with the antibiotics
but the bacteria they were made to fight, and the reason lies in Darwin's theory
of natural selection. Just like any other organisms, individual bacteria
can undergo random mutations. Many of these mutations
are harmful or useless, but every now and then,
one comes along that gives its organism an edge in survival. And for a bacterium, a mutation making it resistant
to a certain antibiotic gives quite the edge. As the non-resistant bacteria
are killed off, which happens especially quickly
in antibiotic-rich environments, like hospitals, there is more room and resources
for the resistant ones to thrive, passing along only the mutated genes
that help them do so. Reproduction
isn't the only way to do this. Some can release their DNA upon death
to be picked up by other bacteria, while others use a method
called conjugation, connecting through pili
to share their genes. Over time, the resistant
genes proliferate, creating entire strains
of resistant super bacteria. So how much time do we have
before these superbugs take over? Well, in some bacteria,
it's already happened. For instance, some strands
of staphylococcus aureus, which causes everything from
skin infections to pneumonia and sepsis, have developed into MRSA, becoming resistant
to beta-lactam antibiotics, like penicillin, methicillin,
and oxacillin. Thanks to a gene that replaces the protein
beta-lactams normally target and bind to, MRSA can keep making
its cell walls unimpeded. Other super bacteria, like salmonella, even sometimes produce enzymes
like beta-lactams that break down antibiotic attackers
before they can do any damage, and E. coli, a diverse group of bacteria that contains strains that cause
diarrhea and kidney failure, can prevent the function of antibiotics, like quinolones, by actively
booting any invaders that manage to enter the cell. But there is good news. Scientists are working to stay
one step ahead of the bacteria, and although development
of new antibiotics has slowed in recent years, the World Health Organization has made it
a priority to develop novel treatments. Other scientists are investigating
alternate solutions, such as phage therapy
or using vaccines to prevent infections. Most importantly, curbing the excessive
and unnecessary use of antibiotics, such as for minor infections
that can resolve on their own, as well as changing medical practice
to prevent hospital infections, can have a major impact by keeping more
non-resistant bacteria alive as competition for resistant strains. In the war against super bacteria,
deescalation may sometimes work better than an evolutionary arms race.

**Transcript**:
How and when did our universe begin? How did it get to look like this? How will it end? Humans have been discussing these questions for as long as they've been around
without ever reaching much agreement. Today, cosmologists are working hard
to find the answers. But how can anyone hope to find
concrete answers to such profound questions? And how is it possible to explore and study
something as huge as the universe, most of which we'll never be able to reach? The answer is light. And although light from
distant parts of the universe can take billions of years to reach us, it carries six unique messages
that, when put together, can disclose an amazing amount
of information to astronomers who know how to look for it. Just as sunlight can be split up
into the familiar rainbow, splitting the light from distant objects
exposes different patterns of colors depending on its source. This distinctive light barcode
can reveal not only an object's composition, but also the temperature and pressure
of its constituent parts. There's even more we can
discover from light. If you've ever stood on a train platform,
you might have noticed that the train sounds different 
depending on its direction with the pitch ascending 
when it approaches you and descending when it speeds away. But this isn't because the train conductor
is practicing for a second career. Rather, it's because of something
called the Doppler effect where sound waves generated by
an approaching object are compressed, while those from a receding
object are stretched. But what has this to do with astronomy? Sound does not travel through a vacuum.
In space, no one can you hear you scream! But the same Doppler effect applies to light
whose source is moving at exceptional speed. If it's moving towards us, 
the shorter wavelength will make the light appear to be bluer. While light from a source
that's moving away will have a longer wavelength,
shifting towards red. So by analyzing the color pattern
in the Doppler shift of the light from any object observed with a telescope,
we can learn what it's made of, how hot it is and 
how much pressure it's under, as well as whether it's moving, 
in what direction and how fast. And these six measurements,
like six points of light, reveal the history of the universe. The first person to study the light 
from distant galaxies was Edwin Hubble, and the light he observed was redshifted. The distant galaxies were 
all moving away from us, and the further away the were,
the faster they were receding. Hubble had discovered
our universe is expanding, providing the first evidence
for the Big Bang theory. Along with the idea that the visible universe
has been constantly expanding from a densely packed single point, one of this theory's 
most important predictions is that the early universe consisted
of just two gases: hydrogen and helium, in a ratio of three to one. And this prediction can
also be tested with light. If we observe the light from a remote,
quiet region of the universe and split it, we do indeed find the signatures
of the two gases in just those proportions. Another triumph for the Big Bang. However, many puzzles remain. Although we know the
visible universe is expanding, gravity should be applying the brakes. But recent measurements of light
from distant dying stars show us that they're farther away
than predicted. So the expansion of the universe
is actually accelerating. Something appears to be pushing it, and many scientists believe
that something is dark energy, making up over 2/3 of the universe
and slowly tearing it apart. Our knowledge of the behavior of matter
and the precision of our instruments means that simply observing distant stars
can tell us more about the universe than we ever thought possible. But there are other mysteries,
like the nature of dark energy upon which we have yet to shed light.

**Transcript**:
How and when did our universe begin? How did it get to look like this? How will it end? Humans have been discussing these questions for as long as they've been around
without ever reaching much agreement. Today, cosmologists are working hard
to find the answers. But how can anyone hope to find
concrete answers to such profound questions? And how is it possible to explore and study
something as huge as the universe, most of which we'll never be able to reach? The answer is light. And although light from
distant parts of the universe can take billions of years to reach us, it carries six unique messages
that, when put together, can disclose an amazing amount
of information to astronomers who know how to look for it. Just as sunlight can be split up
into the familiar rainbow, splitting the light from distant objects
exposes different patterns of colors depending on its source. This distinctive light barcode
can reveal not only an object's composition, but also the temperature and pressure
of its constituent parts. There's even more we can
discover from light. If you've ever stood on a train platform,
you might have noticed that the train sounds different 
depending on its direction with the pitch ascending 
when it approaches you and descending when it speeds away. But this isn't because the train conductor
is practicing for a second career. Rather, it's because of something
called the Doppler effect where sound waves generated by
an approaching object are compressed, while those from a receding
object are stretched. But what has this to do with astronomy? Sound does not travel through a vacuum.
In space, no one can you hear you scream! But the same Doppler effect applies to light
whose source is moving at exceptional speed. If it's moving towards us, 
the shorter wavelength will make the light appear to be bluer. While light from a source
that's moving away will have a longer wavelength,
shifting towards red. So by analyzing the color pattern
in the Doppler shift of the light from any object observed with a telescope,
we can learn what it's made of, how hot it is and 
how much pressure it's under, as well as whether it's moving, 
in what direction and how fast. And these six measurements,
like six points of light, reveal the history of the universe. The first person to study the light 
from distant galaxies was Edwin Hubble, and the light he observed was redshifted. The distant galaxies were 
all moving away from us, and the further away the were,
the faster they were receding. Hubble had discovered
our universe is expanding, providing the first evidence
for the Big Bang theory. Along with the idea that the visible universe
has been constantly expanding from a densely packed single point, one of this theory's 
most important predictions is that the early universe consisted
of just two gases: hydrogen and helium, in a ratio of three to one. And this prediction can
also be tested with light. If we observe the light from a remote,
quiet region of the universe and split it, we do indeed find the signatures
of the two gases in just those proportions. Another triumph for the Big Bang. However, many puzzles remain. Although we know the
visible universe is expanding, gravity should be applying the brakes. But recent measurements of light
from distant dying stars show us that they're farther away
than predicted. So the expansion of the universe
is actually accelerating. Something appears to be pushing it, and many scientists believe
that something is dark energy, making up over 2/3 of the universe
and slowly tearing it apart. Our knowledge of the behavior of matter
and the precision of our instruments means that simply observing distant stars
can tell us more about the universe than we ever thought possible. But there are other mysteries,
like the nature of dark energy upon which we have yet to shed light.

**Transcript**:
You've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth, but how does it work? Is it like the glass of a greenhouse or like an insulating blanket? Well, not entirely. The answer involves a bit of quantum mechanics, but don't worry, we'll start with a rainbow. If you look closely at sunlight separated through a prism, you'll see dark gaps where bands of color went missing. Where did they go? Before reaching our eyes, different gases absorbed those specific parts of the spectrum. For example, oxygen gas snatched up some of the dark red light, and sodium grabbed two bands of yellow. But why do these gases absorb specific colors of light? This is where we enter the quantum realm. Every atom and molecule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electrons. To shift its electrons from the ground state to a higher level, a molecule needs to gain a certain amount of energy. No more, no less. It gets that energy from light, which comes in more energy levels than you could count. Light consists of tiny particles called photons and the amount of energy in each photon corresponds to its color. Red light has lower energy and longer wavelengths. Purple light has higher energy and shorter wavelengths. Sunlight offers all the photons of the rainbow, so a gas molecule can choose the photons that carry the exact amount of energy needed to shift the molecule to its next energy level. When this match is made, the photon disappers as the molecule gains its energy, and we get a small gap in our rainbow. If a photon carries too much or too little energy, the molecule has no choice but to let it fly past. This is why glass is transparent. The atoms in glass do not pair well with any of the energy levels in visible light, so the photons pass through. So, which photons does carbon dioxide prefer? Where is the black line in our rainbow that explains global warming? Well, it's not there. Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb light directly from the Sun. It absorbs light from a totally different celestial body. One that doesn't appear to be emitting light at all: Earth. If you're wondering why our planet doesn't seem to be glowing, it's because the Earth doesn't emit visible light. It emits infared light. The light that our eyes can see, including all of the colors of the rainbow, is just a small part of the larger spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays. It may seem strange to think of these things as light, but there is no fundamental difference between visible light and other electromagnetic radiation. It's the same energy, but at a higher or lower level. In fact, it's a bit presumptuous to define the term visible light by our own limitations. After all, infrared light is visible to snakes, and ultraviolet light is visible to birds. If our eyes were adapted to see light of 1900 megahertz, then a mobile phone would be a flashlight, and a cell phone tower would look like a huge lantern. Earth emits infrared radiation because every object with a temperature above absolute zero will emit light. This is called thermal radiation. The hotter an object gets, the higher frequency the light it emits. When you heat a piece of iron, it will emit more and more frequencies of infrared light, and then, at a temperature of around 450 degrees Celsius, its light will reach the visible spectrum. At first, it will look red hot. And with even more heat, it will glow white with all of the frequencies of visible light. This is how traditional light bulbs were designed to work and why they're so wasteful. 95% of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes. It's wasted as heat. Earth's infrared radiation would escape to space if there weren't greenhouse gas molecules in our atmophere. Just as oxygen gas prefers the dark red photons, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases match with infrared photons. They provide the right amount of energy to shift the gas molecules into their higher energy level. Shortly after a carbon dioxide molecule absorbs an infrared photon, it will fall back to its previous energy level, and spit a photon back out in a random direction. Some of that energy then returns to Earth's surface, causing warming. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more likely that infrared photons will land back on Earth and change our climate.

**Transcript**:
You've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth, but how does it work? Is it like the glass of a greenhouse or like an insulating blanket? Well, not entirely. The answer involves a bit of quantum mechanics, but don't worry, we'll start with a rainbow. If you look closely at sunlight separated through a prism, you'll see dark gaps where bands of color went missing. Where did they go? Before reaching our eyes, different gases absorbed those specific parts of the spectrum. For example, oxygen gas snatched up some of the dark red light, and sodium grabbed two bands of yellow. But why do these gases absorb specific colors of light? This is where we enter the quantum realm. Every atom and molecule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electrons. To shift its electrons from the ground state to a higher level, a molecule needs to gain a certain amount of energy. No more, no less. It gets that energy from light, which comes in more energy levels than you could count. Light consists of tiny particles called photons and the amount of energy in each photon corresponds to its color. Red light has lower energy and longer wavelengths. Purple light has higher energy and shorter wavelengths. Sunlight offers all the photons of the rainbow, so a gas molecule can choose the photons that carry the exact amount of energy needed to shift the molecule to its next energy level. When this match is made, the photon disappers as the molecule gains its energy, and we get a small gap in our rainbow. If a photon carries too much or too little energy, the molecule has no choice but to let it fly past. This is why glass is transparent. The atoms in glass do not pair well with any of the energy levels in visible light, so the photons pass through. So, which photons does carbon dioxide prefer? Where is the black line in our rainbow that explains global warming? Well, it's not there. Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb light directly from the Sun. It absorbs light from a totally different celestial body. One that doesn't appear to be emitting light at all: Earth. If you're wondering why our planet doesn't seem to be glowing, it's because the Earth doesn't emit visible light. It emits infared light. The light that our eyes can see, including all of the colors of the rainbow, is just a small part of the larger spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays. It may seem strange to think of these things as light, but there is no fundamental difference between visible light and other electromagnetic radiation. It's the same energy, but at a higher or lower level. In fact, it's a bit presumptuous to define the term visible light by our own limitations. After all, infrared light is visible to snakes, and ultraviolet light is visible to birds. If our eyes were adapted to see light of 1900 megahertz, then a mobile phone would be a flashlight, and a cell phone tower would look like a huge lantern. Earth emits infrared radiation because every object with a temperature above absolute zero will emit light. This is called thermal radiation. The hotter an object gets, the higher frequency the light it emits. When you heat a piece of iron, it will emit more and more frequencies of infrared light, and then, at a temperature of around 450 degrees Celsius, its light will reach the visible spectrum. At first, it will look red hot. And with even more heat, it will glow white with all of the frequencies of visible light. This is how traditional light bulbs were designed to work and why they're so wasteful. 95% of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes. It's wasted as heat. Earth's infrared radiation would escape to space if there weren't greenhouse gas molecules in our atmophere. Just as oxygen gas prefers the dark red photons, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases match with infrared photons. They provide the right amount of energy to shift the gas molecules into their higher energy level. Shortly after a carbon dioxide molecule absorbs an infrared photon, it will fall back to its previous energy level, and spit a photon back out in a random direction. Some of that energy then returns to Earth's surface, causing warming. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more likely that infrared photons will land back on Earth and change our climate.

**Transcript**:
When we think of classic works of art, the most common setting we imagine them in is a museum. But what we often forget is that much of this art was not produced with a museum setting in mind. What happens to an artwork when it's taken out of its originally intended context? Take the example of Michelangelo's Statue of David, depicting the boy hero who slew the giant philistine, Goliath, armed with only his courage and his slingshot. When Michelangelo began carving a block of pure white marble to communicate this famous Biblical story, the city of Florence intended to place the finished product atop their grand cathedral. Not only would the 17 foot tall statue be easily visible at this height, but its placement alongside 11 other statues of Old Testament heroes towering over onlookers would have a powerful religious significance, forcing the viewer to stare in awe towards the heavens. But by the time Michelangelo had finished the work, in 1504, the plans for the other statues had fallen through, and the city realized that lifting such a large sculpture to the roof would be more difficult than they had thought. Furthermore, the statue was so detailed and lifelike, down to the bulging veins in David's arm and the determination on his face, that it seemed a shame to hide it so far from the viewer. A council of politicians and artists convened to decide on a new location for the statue. Ultimately voting to place it in front of the Palazzo della Signoria, the town hall and home of the new Republican government. This new location transformed the statue's meaning. The Medici family, who for generations had ruled the city through their control of banking, had recently been exiled, and Florence now saw itself as a free city, threatened on all sides by wealthy and powerful rivals. David, now the symbol of heroic resistance against overwhelming odds, was placed with his intense stare, now a look of stern warning, focused directly towards Rome, the home of Cardinal Giovanni de Medici. Though the statue itself had not been altered, its placement changed nearly every aspect of it from a religious to a political significance. Though a replica of David still appears at the Palazzo, the original statue was moved in 1873 to the Galleria dell'Accademia, where it remains today. In the orderly, quiet environment of the museum, alongside numerous half-finished Michelangelo sculptures, overt religious and political interpretations fall away, giving way to detached contemplation of Michelangelo's artistic and technical skill. But even here, the astute viewer may notice that David's head and hand appear disproportionately large, a reminder that they were made to be viewed from below. So, not only does context change the meaning and interpretation of an artwork throughout its history, sometimes it can make that history resurface in the most unexpected ways.

**Transcript**:
When we think of classic works of art, the most common setting we imagine them in is a museum. But what we often forget is that much of this art was not produced with a museum setting in mind. What happens to an artwork when it's taken out of its originally intended context? Take the example of Michelangelo's Statue of David, depicting the boy hero who slew the giant philistine, Goliath, armed with only his courage and his slingshot. When Michelangelo began carving a block of pure white marble to communicate this famous Biblical story, the city of Florence intended to place the finished product atop their grand cathedral. Not only would the 17 foot tall statue be easily visible at this height, but its placement alongside 11 other statues of Old Testament heroes towering over onlookers would have a powerful religious significance, forcing the viewer to stare in awe towards the heavens. But by the time Michelangelo had finished the work, in 1504, the plans for the other statues had fallen through, and the city realized that lifting such a large sculpture to the roof would be more difficult than they had thought. Furthermore, the statue was so detailed and lifelike, down to the bulging veins in David's arm and the determination on his face, that it seemed a shame to hide it so far from the viewer. A council of politicians and artists convened to decide on a new location for the statue. Ultimately voting to place it in front of the Palazzo della Signoria, the town hall and home of the new Republican government. This new location transformed the statue's meaning. The Medici family, who for generations had ruled the city through their control of banking, had recently been exiled, and Florence now saw itself as a free city, threatened on all sides by wealthy and powerful rivals. David, now the symbol of heroic resistance against overwhelming odds, was placed with his intense stare, now a look of stern warning, focused directly towards Rome, the home of Cardinal Giovanni de Medici. Though the statue itself had not been altered, its placement changed nearly every aspect of it from a religious to a political significance. Though a replica of David still appears at the Palazzo, the original statue was moved in 1873 to the Galleria dell'Accademia, where it remains today. In the orderly, quiet environment of the museum, alongside numerous half-finished Michelangelo sculptures, overt religious and political interpretations fall away, giving way to detached contemplation of Michelangelo's artistic and technical skill. But even here, the astute viewer may notice that David's head and hand appear disproportionately large, a reminder that they were made to be viewed from below. So, not only does context change the meaning and interpretation of an artwork throughout its history, sometimes it can make that history resurface in the most unexpected ways.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] what do I know that would cause me a reticent Midwestern scientist to get myself arrested in front of the White House protesting and what would you do if you knew what I know let's start with how I got to this point I was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the State University and I was really lucky to go to the University of Iowa where I could study under Professor James Van Allen who built instruments for the first US satellites Professor Van Allen told me about observations of Venus that there was intense microwave radiation did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere or was Venus extremely hot the right answer confirmed by the Soviet Vena spacecraft was that Venus was very hot 900° fah and it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid but while our instrument was being built I became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on Earth because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing eventually I resigned as principal investigator on our Venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important it changes will affect all Humanity the greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century British physicist John Tindle in the 1850s made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation which is heat and he showed that Gases such as CO2 absorb heat thus acting like a blanket warming Earth's surface I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations in 1981 we published an article in Science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 de C in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO2 that Earth would likely warm in the 1980s and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century we also said that the 21st century would see shifting climate zones creation of drought prone regions in North America and Asia erosion of ice sheets rising sea levels and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage all of these impacts have since either happened or are now well underway that paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times and led to me testifying to con in the 1980s testimony in which I emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the Earth's water cycle heat waves and droughts on one hand directly from the warming but also because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy rainfall will become in more extreme events there will be stronger storms and greater flooding global warming hoop law became time consuming and distracted me from doing science partly because I had complained that the White House altered my testimony so I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others by 15 years later evidence of global warming was much stronger most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels by then we had two grandchildren Sophie and Connor I decided that I did not want them in the future to say oppa understood what was happening but he didn't make it clear so I decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004 and at the 2005 meeting of the American geophysical Union this led to calls from the White House to NASA headquarters and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by NASA headquarters after I informed the New York Times about these restrictions NASA was forced to end the censorship but there were consequences I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement to understand and protect the home planet to justify my talks soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted never to appear again over the next few years I was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies while still researching the physics of climate change let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics first from Earth's energy balance and second from Earth's climate history adding CO2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed it reduces Earth's heat radiation to space so there's a temporary energy imbalance more energy is coming in than going out until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun so the key quantity is Earth's energy imbalance is there more energy coming in than going out if so more warming is in the pipeline it will occur without adding any more greenhouse gases now finally we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth's heat reservoirs the biggest Reservoir the ocean was the least well measured until until more than 3,000 Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean these floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining Heat at a substantial rate the deep ocean is also gaining Heat at a smaller rate and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet and the land to depths of tens of meters is also warming the total energy imbalance now is about 6/10 of a watt per square meter that may not sound like much but when added up over the whole world it's enormous it's about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity it's equivalent to exploding 400,000 hirosima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year that's how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day this imbalance if we want to stabilize climate means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 PPM parts per million back to 350 PPM that is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change but the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record when the sun's energy reaching Earth was least yet there was more energy coming in than going out this shows that the effect of the sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gases mainly from burning fossil fuels now consider earth's climate history these curves for Global temperature atmospheric CO2 and sea level were derived from Ocean cores and Antarctic Ice cores from Ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a 2-mile thick ice sheet as you see there is a high correlation between temperature CO2 and sea level careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO2 changes by a few centuries climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying look the temperature causes CO2 to change not vice versa but that leg is exactly what is expected small changes in Earth's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on earth when there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer ice sheets melt shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer a warmer ocean releases CO2 just as a warm Coca-Cola does and more CO2 causes more warming so CO2 methane and ice sheets were feedbacks that Amplified Global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing the important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today the physics does not change as Earth warms now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere ice will melt and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost while we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur it is certain they will occur unless we stop the warming there is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning prec precise measurements by Grace the gravity satellite reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass several hundred cubic kilometers per year and the rate has accelerated since the measurements began 9 years ago methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost what sea level rise can we look forward to the last time CO2 was 390 PP M today's value sea level was higher by at least 15 m 50 ft where you are sitting now would be underwater most estimates are that this Century we will get at least one meter I think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels perhaps even 5 meters which is 18 ft this Century or shortly thereafter the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of Humanity's control ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries there would be no stable Shoreline The Economic Consequences are almost Unthinkable hundreds of New Orleans likee devastations around the world what may be more reprehensible if climate denial continues is extermination of species the monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50% of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business as usual fossil fuel use global warming is already affecting people the Texas Oklahoma Mexico Heatwave and drought last year Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003 were all exceptional events more than three standard deviations outside the norm 50 years ago such anomalies covered only 2 to 3/10 of 1% of the land area in recent years because of global warming they Now cover about 10% and increase by a factor of 25 to 50 so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heat waves were not natural they were caused by global warming an important impact if global warming continues will be on the Bread Basket of our nation and the world the Midwest in Great Plains which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts worse than the Dust Bowl within just a few decades if we let global warming continue how did I get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate giving talks in 10 countries getting arrested burning up the vacation time that I had accumulated over 30 years more grandchildren helped me along Jake is a super positive enthusiastic boy here at Age 2 and A2 years he thinks he can protect his 2 and a half day old little sister it would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple honest approach of a gradually Rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100% electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis with the government not keeping one dime most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they pay in increased prices this fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and Innovations creating millions of jobs it is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future several top economists are co-authors on this proposition Jim dep peso a Republicans for Environmental Protection describes it thusly transparent market-based does not enlarge government leaves energy decisions to individual choices sounds like a conservative climate plan but instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 4500 billion dollar per year worldwide thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel mountaintop removal long wall mining fracking tar Sands tar Shale deep ocean Arctic drilling this path if continued guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future Generations a large fraction of species will be committed to Extinction and increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact bread baskets of the world causing massive famin and economic decline imagine a giant asteroid on a direct Collision Course with earth that is the equivalent of what we face now yet we dither taking no action to divert the asteroid even though the longer we wait the more difficult and expensive it becomes if we had started in 2005 it would have required emission reductions of 3% per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabil ized climate this Century if we start next year it is 6% per year if we wait 10 years it is 15% per year extremely difficult and expensive perhaps impossible but we aren't even starting so now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm clearly I haven't got this message across the science is clear I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its Solutions more effectively we owe it to our children and grandchildren thank [Applause] [Music] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] what do I know that would cause me a reticent Midwestern scientist to get myself arrested in front of the White House protesting and what would you do if you knew what I know let's start with how I got to this point I was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the State University and I was really lucky to go to the University of Iowa where I could study under Professor James Van Allen who built instruments for the first US satellites Professor Van Allen told me about observations of Venus that there was intense microwave radiation did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere or was Venus extremely hot the right answer confirmed by the Soviet Vena spacecraft was that Venus was very hot 900° fah and it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid but while our instrument was being built I became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on Earth because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing eventually I resigned as principal investigator on our Venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important it changes will affect all Humanity the greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century British physicist John Tindle in the 1850s made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation which is heat and he showed that Gases such as CO2 absorb heat thus acting like a blanket warming Earth's surface I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations in 1981 we published an article in Science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 de C in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO2 that Earth would likely warm in the 1980s and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century we also said that the 21st century would see shifting climate zones creation of drought prone regions in North America and Asia erosion of ice sheets rising sea levels and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage all of these impacts have since either happened or are now well underway that paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times and led to me testifying to con in the 1980s testimony in which I emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the Earth's water cycle heat waves and droughts on one hand directly from the warming but also because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy rainfall will become in more extreme events there will be stronger storms and greater flooding global warming hoop law became time consuming and distracted me from doing science partly because I had complained that the White House altered my testimony so I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others by 15 years later evidence of global warming was much stronger most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels by then we had two grandchildren Sophie and Connor I decided that I did not want them in the future to say oppa understood what was happening but he didn't make it clear so I decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004 and at the 2005 meeting of the American geophysical Union this led to calls from the White House to NASA headquarters and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by NASA headquarters after I informed the New York Times about these restrictions NASA was forced to end the censorship but there were consequences I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement to understand and protect the home planet to justify my talks soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted never to appear again over the next few years I was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies while still researching the physics of climate change let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics first from Earth's energy balance and second from Earth's climate history adding CO2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed it reduces Earth's heat radiation to space so there's a temporary energy imbalance more energy is coming in than going out until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun so the key quantity is Earth's energy imbalance is there more energy coming in than going out if so more warming is in the pipeline it will occur without adding any more greenhouse gases now finally we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth's heat reservoirs the biggest Reservoir the ocean was the least well measured until until more than 3,000 Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean these floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining Heat at a substantial rate the deep ocean is also gaining Heat at a smaller rate and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet and the land to depths of tens of meters is also warming the total energy imbalance now is about 6/10 of a watt per square meter that may not sound like much but when added up over the whole world it's enormous it's about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity it's equivalent to exploding 400,000 hirosima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year that's how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day this imbalance if we want to stabilize climate means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 PPM parts per million back to 350 PPM that is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change but the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record when the sun's energy reaching Earth was least yet there was more energy coming in than going out this shows that the effect of the sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gases mainly from burning fossil fuels now consider earth's climate history these curves for Global temperature atmospheric CO2 and sea level were derived from Ocean cores and Antarctic Ice cores from Ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a 2-mile thick ice sheet as you see there is a high correlation between temperature CO2 and sea level careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO2 changes by a few centuries climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying look the temperature causes CO2 to change not vice versa but that leg is exactly what is expected small changes in Earth's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on earth when there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer ice sheets melt shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer a warmer ocean releases CO2 just as a warm Coca-Cola does and more CO2 causes more warming so CO2 methane and ice sheets were feedbacks that Amplified Global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing the important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today the physics does not change as Earth warms now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere ice will melt and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost while we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur it is certain they will occur unless we stop the warming there is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning prec precise measurements by Grace the gravity satellite reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass several hundred cubic kilometers per year and the rate has accelerated since the measurements began 9 years ago methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost what sea level rise can we look forward to the last time CO2 was 390 PP M today's value sea level was higher by at least 15 m 50 ft where you are sitting now would be underwater most estimates are that this Century we will get at least one meter I think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels perhaps even 5 meters which is 18 ft this Century or shortly thereafter the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of Humanity's control ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries there would be no stable Shoreline The Economic Consequences are almost Unthinkable hundreds of New Orleans likee devastations around the world what may be more reprehensible if climate denial continues is extermination of species the monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50% of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business as usual fossil fuel use global warming is already affecting people the Texas Oklahoma Mexico Heatwave and drought last year Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003 were all exceptional events more than three standard deviations outside the norm 50 years ago such anomalies covered only 2 to 3/10 of 1% of the land area in recent years because of global warming they Now cover about 10% and increase by a factor of 25 to 50 so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heat waves were not natural they were caused by global warming an important impact if global warming continues will be on the Bread Basket of our nation and the world the Midwest in Great Plains which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts worse than the Dust Bowl within just a few decades if we let global warming continue how did I get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate giving talks in 10 countries getting arrested burning up the vacation time that I had accumulated over 30 years more grandchildren helped me along Jake is a super positive enthusiastic boy here at Age 2 and A2 years he thinks he can protect his 2 and a half day old little sister it would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple honest approach of a gradually Rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100% electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis with the government not keeping one dime most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they pay in increased prices this fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and Innovations creating millions of jobs it is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future several top economists are co-authors on this proposition Jim dep peso a Republicans for Environmental Protection describes it thusly transparent market-based does not enlarge government leaves energy decisions to individual choices sounds like a conservative climate plan but instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 4500 billion dollar per year worldwide thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel mountaintop removal long wall mining fracking tar Sands tar Shale deep ocean Arctic drilling this path if continued guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future Generations a large fraction of species will be committed to Extinction and increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact bread baskets of the world causing massive famin and economic decline imagine a giant asteroid on a direct Collision Course with earth that is the equivalent of what we face now yet we dither taking no action to divert the asteroid even though the longer we wait the more difficult and expensive it becomes if we had started in 2005 it would have required emission reductions of 3% per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabil ized climate this Century if we start next year it is 6% per year if we wait 10 years it is 15% per year extremely difficult and expensive perhaps impossible but we aren't even starting so now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm clearly I haven't got this message across the science is clear I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its Solutions more effectively we owe it to our children and grandchildren thank [Applause] [Music] you

**Transcript**:
Tattoos have often been presented in popular media as either marks
of the dangerous and deviant or trendy youth fads. But while tattoo styles come and go, and their meaning has differed
greatly across cultures, the practice is as old
as civilization itself. Decorative skin markings have
been discovered in human remains all over the world, with the oldest found on a Peruvian
mummy dating back to 6,000 BCE. But have you ever wondered
how tattooing really works? You may know that we shed our skin, losing about 30-40,000
skin cells per hour. That's about 1,000,000 per day. So, how come the tattoo doesn't
gradually flake off along with them? The simple answer
is that tattooing involves getting pigment deeper into the skin than the outermost layer that gets shed. Throughout history, different cultures have used various methods
to accomplish this. But the first modern tattooing machine was modeled after Thomas Edison's
engraving machine and ran on electricity. Tattooing machines used today insert tiny needles,
loaded with dye, into the skin at a frequency of 50
to 3,000 times per minute. The needles punch through the epidermis, allowing ink to seep deep into the dermis, which is composed of collagen fibers,
nerves, glands, blood vessels and more. Every time a needle
penetrates, it causes a wound that alerts the body to begin
the inflammatory process, calling immune system cells
to the wound site to begin repairing the skin. And it is this very process
that makes tattoos permanent. First, specialized cells
called macrophages eat the invading material in an attempt
to clean up the inflammatory mess. As these cells travel
through the lymphatic system, some of them are carried back with a belly
full of dye into the lymph nodes while others remain in the dermis. With no way to dispose of the pigment, the dyes inside them remain
visible through the skin. Some of the ink particles
are also suspended in the gel-like matrix of the dermis, while others are engulfed
by dermal cells called fibroblasts. Initially, ink is deposited
into the epidermis as well, but as the skin heals, the damaged
epidermal cells are shed and replaced by new, dye-free cells with the topmost layer peeling
off like a heeling sunburn. Blistering or crusting is not typically
seen with professional tattoos and complete epidermal
regeneration requires 2-4 weeks, during which excess
sun exposure and swimming should be avoided to prevent fading. Dermal cells, however,
remain in place until they die. When they do, they are taken up,
ink and all, by younger cells nearby, so the ink stays where it is. But with time, tattoos do fade naturally as the body reacts
to the alien pigment particles, slowly breaking them down
to be carried off by the immune system's macrophages. Ultraviolet radiation can also
contribute to this pigment breakdown, though it can be mitigated
by the use of sunblock. But since the dermal cells
are relatively stable, much of the ink will remain deep
in the skin for a person's whole life. But if tattoos are embedded in your skin
for life, is there any way to erase them? Technically, yes. Today, a laser is used
to penetrate the epidermis and blast apart underlying pigment
colors of various wavelengths, black being the easiest to target. The laser beam breaks the ink globules
into smaller particles that can then be cleared away
by the macrophages. But some color inks are harder
to remove than others, and there could be complications. For this reason, removing a tattoo
is still more difficult than getting one, but not impossible. So a single tattoo may
not truly last forever, but tattoos have been around longer
than any existing culture. And their continuing popularity means
that the art of tattooing is here to stay.

**Transcript**:
Tattoos have often been presented in popular media as either marks
of the dangerous and deviant or trendy youth fads. But while tattoo styles come and go, and their meaning has differed
greatly across cultures, the practice is as old
as civilization itself. Decorative skin markings have
been discovered in human remains all over the world, with the oldest found on a Peruvian
mummy dating back to 6,000 BCE. But have you ever wondered
how tattooing really works? You may know that we shed our skin, losing about 30-40,000
skin cells per hour. That's about 1,000,000 per day. So, how come the tattoo doesn't
gradually flake off along with them? The simple answer
is that tattooing involves getting pigment deeper into the skin than the outermost layer that gets shed. Throughout history, different cultures have used various methods
to accomplish this. But the first modern tattooing machine was modeled after Thomas Edison's
engraving machine and ran on electricity. Tattooing machines used today insert tiny needles,
loaded with dye, into the skin at a frequency of 50
to 3,000 times per minute. The needles punch through the epidermis, allowing ink to seep deep into the dermis, which is composed of collagen fibers,
nerves, glands, blood vessels and more. Every time a needle
penetrates, it causes a wound that alerts the body to begin
the inflammatory process, calling immune system cells
to the wound site to begin repairing the skin. And it is this very process
that makes tattoos permanent. First, specialized cells
called macrophages eat the invading material in an attempt
to clean up the inflammatory mess. As these cells travel
through the lymphatic system, some of them are carried back with a belly
full of dye into the lymph nodes while others remain in the dermis. With no way to dispose of the pigment, the dyes inside them remain
visible through the skin. Some of the ink particles
are also suspended in the gel-like matrix of the dermis, while others are engulfed
by dermal cells called fibroblasts. Initially, ink is deposited
into the epidermis as well, but as the skin heals, the damaged
epidermal cells are shed and replaced by new, dye-free cells with the topmost layer peeling
off like a heeling sunburn. Blistering or crusting is not typically
seen with professional tattoos and complete epidermal
regeneration requires 2-4 weeks, during which excess
sun exposure and swimming should be avoided to prevent fading. Dermal cells, however,
remain in place until they die. When they do, they are taken up,
ink and all, by younger cells nearby, so the ink stays where it is. But with time, tattoos do fade naturally as the body reacts
to the alien pigment particles, slowly breaking them down
to be carried off by the immune system's macrophages. Ultraviolet radiation can also
contribute to this pigment breakdown, though it can be mitigated
by the use of sunblock. But since the dermal cells
are relatively stable, much of the ink will remain deep
in the skin for a person's whole life. But if tattoos are embedded in your skin
for life, is there any way to erase them? Technically, yes. Today, a laser is used
to penetrate the epidermis and blast apart underlying pigment
colors of various wavelengths, black being the easiest to target. The laser beam breaks the ink globules
into smaller particles that can then be cleared away
by the macrophages. But some color inks are harder
to remove than others, and there could be complications. For this reason, removing a tattoo
is still more difficult than getting one, but not impossible. So a single tattoo may
not truly last forever, but tattoos have been around longer
than any existing culture. And their continuing popularity means
that the art of tattooing is here to stay.

**Transcript**:
They say, 'Time is money,' but what does one really have to do with the other? Meet Sheila! She just got her first big bonus. Sheila knows exactly what she wants to do with that money. She's had her eye on a nice convertible for a while now. Yes, Sheila, that's a nice car! Oh, looks like Sheila is a little short. But wait! She has an idea. Sheila is a smart cookie. She knows that if she deposits the money for a year instead of buying the car today, she will earn interest. Then she'll be able to afford the car. Sheila knows that the value of her deposit one year from now will equal the money deposited today plus the interest earned. We call Sheila's money deposited today the present value of money. And the value of Sheila's deposit next year is the future value of money. What connects one to the other? The interest rate, also known as the time value of money. Now, with a little bit of rearranging, we can figure out the future value of Sheila's money with this equation. So in a year, the future value will be $11,000. Well, it's been a year! And there's Sheila, with enough money to buy the car. Sheila really understands the future value of money. Now, I just hope she understands the speed limit! Now, meet Timmy. He's also gotten his bonus. The money seems to be burning a hole in his pocket. Yes, Timmy, that's a nice car that will surely impress people. Oh! Looks like you're a little short. Maybe you can follow Sheila's example. You see, Timmy, just like Sheila, after the first year, you'll have $11,000. But Timmy, that is still not enough to buy that fancy car. Why don't you leave the money deposited for another year? Let's see how your deposit will be doing in two years. With a little bit of rearranging, it becomes the value of your money next year, times one plus the interest rate. We can then convert the future value one year from now to the present value times one plus the interest rate. We can even simplify this further by just squaring the value of one plus the interest rate. Sorry, Timmy, you'll have more money after two years, but you still can't afford the car! I don't know how many more years you'll have to wait, but I can tell you one way we can figure it out. Do you see that little number two in the equation? Any number that you put in there is the number of years that you are waiting, also known as the period. Sure, Timmy, we can see how much you'll have in five years. Let's connect future value and present value across five years. Let's watch the period increase from two to five. After 5 years, you'll have $16,105.10. Sorry, Timmy, you have to wait a little longer. 10 years? Yeah! Let's see if you'll be able to buy the car then. Not quite. Well, Timmy, it looks like you'll need 26 years to afford this car. You should ask Sheila for a ride to the beach. Maybe a bicycle will suit you better? I hear the bus is pretty cheap!

**Transcript**:
"All men are created equal and they are endowed with the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Not so fast, Mr. Jefferson! These words from the Declaration of Independence, and the facts behind them, are well known. In June of 1776, a little more than a year after the war against England began with the shots fired at Lexington and Concord, the Continental Congress was meeting in Philadelphia to discuss American independence. After long debates, a resolution of independence was approved on July 2, 1776. America was free! And men like John Adams thought we would celebrate that date forever. But it was two days later that the gentlemen in Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence, largely written by Thomas Jefferson, offering all the reasons why the country should be free. More than 235 years later, we celebrate that day as America's birthday. But there are some pieces of the story you may not know. First of all, Thomas Jefferson gets the credit for writing the Declaration, but five men had been given the job to come up with a document explaining why America should be independent: Robert Livingston, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams were all named first. And it was Adams who suggested that the young, and little known, Thomas Jefferson join them because they needed a man from the influential Virginia Delegation, and Adams thought Jefferson was a much better writer than he was. Second, though Jefferson never used footnotes, or credited his sources, some of his memorable words and phrases were borrowed from other writers and slightly tweaked. Then, Franklin and Adams offered a few suggestions. But the most important change came after the Declaration was turned over to the full Congress. For two days, a very unhappy Thomas Jefferson sat and fumed while his words were picked over. In the end, the Congress made a few, minor word changes, and one big deletion. In the long list of charges that Jefferson made against the King of England, the author of the Declaration had included the idea that George the Third was responsible for the slave trade, and was preventing America from ending slavery. That was not only untrue, but Congress wanted no mention of slavery in the nation's founding document. The reference was cut out before the Declaration was approved and sent to the printer. But it leaves open the hard question: How could the men, who were about to sign a document, celebrating liberty and equality, accept a system in which some people owned others? It is a question that would eventually bring the nation to civil war and one we can still ask today.

**Transcript**:
"All men are created equal and they are endowed with the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Not so fast, Mr. Jefferson! These words from the Declaration of Independence, and the facts behind them, are well known. In June of 1776, a little more than a year after the war against England began with the shots fired at Lexington and Concord, the Continental Congress was meeting in Philadelphia to discuss American independence. After long debates, a resolution of independence was approved on July 2, 1776. America was free! And men like John Adams thought we would celebrate that date forever. But it was two days later that the gentlemen in Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence, largely written by Thomas Jefferson, offering all the reasons why the country should be free. More than 235 years later, we celebrate that day as America's birthday. But there are some pieces of the story you may not know. First of all, Thomas Jefferson gets the credit for writing the Declaration, but five men had been given the job to come up with a document explaining why America should be independent: Robert Livingston, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams were all named first. And it was Adams who suggested that the young, and little known, Thomas Jefferson join them because they needed a man from the influential Virginia Delegation, and Adams thought Jefferson was a much better writer than he was. Second, though Jefferson never used footnotes, or credited his sources, some of his memorable words and phrases were borrowed from other writers and slightly tweaked. Then, Franklin and Adams offered a few suggestions. But the most important change came after the Declaration was turned over to the full Congress. For two days, a very unhappy Thomas Jefferson sat and fumed while his words were picked over. In the end, the Congress made a few, minor word changes, and one big deletion. In the long list of charges that Jefferson made against the King of England, the author of the Declaration had included the idea that George the Third was responsible for the slave trade, and was preventing America from ending slavery. That was not only untrue, but Congress wanted no mention of slavery in the nation's founding document. The reference was cut out before the Declaration was approved and sent to the printer. But it leaves open the hard question: How could the men, who were about to sign a document, celebrating liberty and equality, accept a system in which some people owned others? It is a question that would eventually bring the nation to civil war and one we can still ask today.

**Transcript**:
Energy is all around us, a physical quantity that follows
precise natural laws. Our universe has a finite amount of it; it's neither created nor destroyed but can take different forms, such as kinetic or potential energy, with different properties
and formulas to remember. For instance, an LED desk lamp's 6 Watt bulb transfers 6 Joules
of light energy per second. But let's jump back up into space to look at our planet,
its systems, and their energy flow. Earth's physical systems include the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. Energy moves in and out of these systems, and during any energy
transfer between them, some is lost to the surroundings, as heat, light, sound, vibration, or movement. Our planet's energy comes from
internal and external sources. Geothermal energy
from radioactive isotopes and rotational energy
from the spinning of the Earth are internal sources of energy, while the Sun
is the major external source, driving certain systems,
like our weather and climate. Sunlight warms the surface and atmosphere
in varying amounts, and this causes convection, producing winds
and influencing ocean currents. Infrared radiation, radiating out
from the warmed surface of the Earth, gets trapped by greenhouse gases
and further affects the energy flow. The Sun is also the major source
of energy for organisms. Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use sunlight to produce organic matter from carbon dioxide and water, powering the biosphere's food chains. We release this food energy
using chemical reactions, like combustion and respiration. At each level in a food chain,
some energy is stored in newly made chemical structures, but most is lost to the surroundings, as heat, like your body heat, released by your digestion of food. Now, as plants are eaten
by primary consumers, only about 10% of their total energy
is passed on to the next level. Since energy can only flow
in one direction in a food chain, from producers on to consumers
and decomposers, an organism that eats lower
on the food chain, is more efficient than one higher up. So eating producers
is the most efficient level at which an animal can get its energy, but without continual input of energy
to those producers, mostly from sunlight, life on Earth as we know it
would cease to exist. We humans, of course, spend our energy
doing a lot of things besides eating. We travel, we build, we power
all sorts of technology. To do all this, we use sources like fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas, which contain energy that plants captured
from sunlight long ago and stored in the form of carbon. When we burn fossil fuels in power plants, we release this stored energy to generate electricity. To generate electricity, heat from burning fossil fuels
is used to power turbines that rotate magnets, which, in turn, create
magnetic field changes relative to a coil of wire, causing electrons to be
induced to flow in the wire. Modern civilization depends on our ability to keep powering that flow of electrons. Fortunately, we aren't limited
to burning non-renewable fossil fuels to generate electricity. Electrons can also be induced to flow by direct interaction
with light particles, which is how a solar cell operates. Other renewable energy sources, such as wind, water, geothermal, and biofuels can also be used to generate electricity. Global demand for energy is increasing, but the planet
has limited energy resources to access through a complex
energy infrastructure. As populations rise, alongside rates of industrialization
and development, our energy decisions grow
more and more important. Access to energy
impacts health, education, political power, and socioeconomic status. If we improve our energy efficiency, we can use our natural resources
more responsibly and improve quality of life for everyone.

**Transcript**:
Energy is all around us, a physical quantity that follows
precise natural laws. Our universe has a finite amount of it; it's neither created nor destroyed but can take different forms, such as kinetic or potential energy, with different properties
and formulas to remember. For instance, an LED desk lamp's 6 Watt bulb transfers 6 Joules
of light energy per second. But let's jump back up into space to look at our planet,
its systems, and their energy flow. Earth's physical systems include the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. Energy moves in and out of these systems, and during any energy
transfer between them, some is lost to the surroundings, as heat, light, sound, vibration, or movement. Our planet's energy comes from
internal and external sources. Geothermal energy
from radioactive isotopes and rotational energy
from the spinning of the Earth are internal sources of energy, while the Sun
is the major external source, driving certain systems,
like our weather and climate. Sunlight warms the surface and atmosphere
in varying amounts, and this causes convection, producing winds
and influencing ocean currents. Infrared radiation, radiating out
from the warmed surface of the Earth, gets trapped by greenhouse gases
and further affects the energy flow. The Sun is also the major source
of energy for organisms. Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use sunlight to produce organic matter from carbon dioxide and water, powering the biosphere's food chains. We release this food energy
using chemical reactions, like combustion and respiration. At each level in a food chain,
some energy is stored in newly made chemical structures, but most is lost to the surroundings, as heat, like your body heat, released by your digestion of food. Now, as plants are eaten
by primary consumers, only about 10% of their total energy
is passed on to the next level. Since energy can only flow
in one direction in a food chain, from producers on to consumers
and decomposers, an organism that eats lower
on the food chain, is more efficient than one higher up. So eating producers
is the most efficient level at which an animal can get its energy, but without continual input of energy
to those producers, mostly from sunlight, life on Earth as we know it
would cease to exist. We humans, of course, spend our energy
doing a lot of things besides eating. We travel, we build, we power
all sorts of technology. To do all this, we use sources like fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas, which contain energy that plants captured
from sunlight long ago and stored in the form of carbon. When we burn fossil fuels in power plants, we release this stored energy to generate electricity. To generate electricity, heat from burning fossil fuels
is used to power turbines that rotate magnets, which, in turn, create
magnetic field changes relative to a coil of wire, causing electrons to be
induced to flow in the wire. Modern civilization depends on our ability to keep powering that flow of electrons. Fortunately, we aren't limited
to burning non-renewable fossil fuels to generate electricity. Electrons can also be induced to flow by direct interaction
with light particles, which is how a solar cell operates. Other renewable energy sources, such as wind, water, geothermal, and biofuels can also be used to generate electricity. Global demand for energy is increasing, but the planet
has limited energy resources to access through a complex
energy infrastructure. As populations rise, alongside rates of industrialization
and development, our energy decisions grow
more and more important. Access to energy
impacts health, education, political power, and socioeconomic status. If we improve our energy efficiency, we can use our natural resources
more responsibly and improve quality of life for everyone.

**Transcript**:
We've all seen the movies where a monster, created by a scientist in a laboratory, escapes to wreak havoc on the outside world. But what if the monster was not some giant rampaging beast, destroying a city, but just a tiny amount of seaweed with the potential to disrupt entire coastal ecosystems? This is the story of Caulerpa taxifolia, originally a naturally occurring seaweed native to tropical waters. In the 1980s, one strain was found to thrive in colder environments. This trait, combined with its beautiful, bright green color and ability to grow quickly without maintenance made it ideal for aquariums, which it helped keep clean by consuming nutrients and chemicals in the water. Further selective breeding made it even heartier, and soon it was used in aquariums around the world. But it was not long before a sample of this aquarium-developed super algae turned up in the Mediterranean Sea near the famed Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. The marine biologist who found it believed that the museum had accidentally realeased it into the ocean along with aquarium waters, while museum directors claimed it had be carried into the area by ocean currents. Regardless of how it ended up there, the non-native Caulerpa multiplied rapidly, having no natural predators due to releasing a toxin that keeps fish away. And like some mythical monster, even a tiny piece that broke off could grow into a whole new colony. Through water currents and contact with boat anchors and fishing lines, it fragmented and spread throughout Mediterranean coastal cities covering coral reefs. So what was the result of this invasion? Well, it depends on who you ask. Many scientists warned that the spread of Caulerpa reduces biodiversity by crowding out native species of seaweed that are eaten by fish, with the biologist who first discovered its presence dubbing it Killer Algae. Other studies instead claim that the algae actually had a beneficial effect by consuming chemical pollutants -- one reason the aquariums strain was developed. But the disruption of a natural ecosystem by an introduced foreign species can have unpredictable and uncontrollable effects that may not be immediately visible. So when Culerpa taxifolia was discovered at Carlsbad's Agua Hedionda Lagoon, near San Diego in the year 2000, having most likely come from the dumping of home aquarium water into a connecting storm drain, it was decided to stop it before it spread. Tarps were placed over the Culerpa colonies and chlorine injected inside. Although this method killed all other marine life trapped under the tarps, it did succeed in eradicating the algae and native eelgrass was able to emerge in its place. By responding quickly, authorities in California were able to prevent Culerpa from propagating. But another occurrence of the strain, in the coastal wetlands of southeast Australia, was left unchecked and allowed to spread. And unfortunately, a tarp cannot cover the Mediterranean Sea or the Australian coast. Invasive species are not a new problem, and can indeed occur naturally. But when such species are the results of human directed selective breeding or genetic modification and then released into the natural environment, their effect on ecosystems can be far more radical and irreversible. With the proliferation of new technologies and multiple threats to the environment, it is more important than ever for scientists to monitor and evaluate the risks and dangers, and for the rest of us to remember that what starts in our backyard can effect ecosystems half a world away.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Fragmentation refers to a tiny piece of the Caulerpa seaweed getting disconnected. The disconnected piece can then start the growth of a new colony. Therefore, touching the Caulerpa, anchors, and fishing lines can lead to fragmentation, that is why the eradication technique in Carlsbad involved:
Options: A. Covering the Caulerpa with tarps and injecting chlorine, B. Draining Agua Hedionda Lagoon so it could dry up, C. Using rakes and shovels underwater to dig it out, D. Leaving it alone so it could die off in cold winter water
Correct Option: A

Question: What is the primary reason to switch to solar power?

This is the story of Caulerpa taxifolia, originally a naturally occurring seaweed native to tropical waters. In the 1980s, one strain was found to thrive in colder environments. This trait, combined with its beautiful, bright green color and ability to grow quickly without maintenance made it ideal for aquariums, which it helped keep clean by consuming nutrients and chemicals in the water. Further selective breeding made it even heartier, and soon it was used in aquariums around the world. But it was not long before a sample of this aquarium-developed super algae turned up in the Mediterranean Sea near the famed Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. The marine biologist who found it believed that the museum had accidentally realeased it into the ocean along with aquarium waters, while museum directors claimed it had be carried into the area by ocean currents. Regardless of how it ended up there, the non-native Caulerpa multiplied rapidly, having no natural predators due to releasing a toxin that keeps fish away. And like some mythical monster, even a tiny piece that broke off could grow into a whole new colony. Through water currents and contact with boat anchors and fishing lines, it fragmented and spread throughout Mediterranean coastal cities covering coral reefs. So what was the result of this invasion? Well, it depends on who you ask. Many scientists warned that the spread of Caulerpa reduces biodiversity by crowding out native species of seaweed that are eaten by fish, with the biologist who first discovered its presence dubbing it Killer Algae. Other studies instead claim that the algae actually had a beneficial effect by consuming chemical pollutants -- one reason the aquariums strain was developed. But the disruption of a natural ecosystem by an introduced foreign species can have unpredictable and uncontrollable effects that may not be immediately visible. So when Culerpa taxifolia was discovered at Carlsbad's Agua Hedionda Lagoon, near San Diego in the year 2000, having most likely come from the dumping of home aquarium water into a connecting storm drain, it was decided to stop it before it spread. Tarps were placed over the Culerpa colonies and chlorine injected inside. Although this method killed all other marine life trapped under the tarps, it did succeed in eradicating the algae and native eelgrass was able to emerge in its place. By responding quickly, authorities in California were able to prevent Culerpa from propagating. But another occurrence of the strain, in the coastal wetlands of southeast Australia, was left unchecked and allowed to spread. And unfortunately, a tarp cannot cover the Mediterranean Sea or the Australian coast. Invasive species are not a new problem, and can indeed occur naturally. But when such species are the results of human directed selective breeding or genetic modification and then released into the natural environment, their effect on ecosystems can be far more radical and irreversible. With the proliferation of new technologies and multiple threats to the environment, it is more important than ever for scientists to monitor and evaluate the risks and dangers, and for the rest of us to remember that what starts in our backyard can effect ecosystems half a world away.

**Transcript**:
We have some good reasons to completely switch over to solar power. It's cheaper in many cases, and definitely more sustainable than our dependance on traditional power plants that use resources like coal, which will eventually run out. So why don't we replace these traditional plants with solar energy? Because there's one factor that makes solar power very unpredictable: cloud cover. As the sun's rays move towards Earth, some get absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, some are reflected back into outer space, but the rest make it to the Earth's surface. The ones that aren't deviated are called direct irradiance. The ones that are deflected by clouds are called diffuse irradiance. And those rays that first get reflected by a surface, like a nearby building, before reaching the solar energy system are called reflected irradiance. But before we can examine how clouds affect the sun's rays and electricity production, let's see how these solar energy systems work. First up, we have solar towers. These are made up of a central tower surrounded by a huge field of mirrors that track the sun's path and focus only the direct rays onto a single point on the tower, kind of like an eager beachgoer. The heat generated by these rays is so immense that it can be used to boil water producing steam that drives a traditional turbine, which makes electricity. But when we say solar energy systems, we're usually talking about photovoltaics, or solar panels, which are the systems most commonly used to generate solar power. In solar panels, photons from the sun's rays hit the surface of a panel, and electrons are released to get an electric current going. Solar panels can use all types of irradiance, while solar towers can only use direct irradiance, and this is where clouds become important because depending on their type and location relative to the sun, they can either increase or decrease the amount of electricity produced. For instance, even a few cumulus clouds in front of the sun can reduce the electricity production in solar towers to almost zero because of this dependence on direct rays. In solar panels, those clouds would decrease energy output as well, though not as much because solar panels can use all types of irradiance. However, all this depends on the clouds exact positioning. Due to reflection, or a particular phenomeon called Mie scattering, the sun's rays can actually be focused forward by clouds to create a more than 50% increase in the solar irradiance reaching a solar panel. If this potential increase isn't accounted for, it could damage the solar panel. Why does this matter? Well, you wouldn't want this lesson to stop just because a cloud passed over the panel on your roof. In solar towers, huge tanks of molten salt or oil can be used to store any excess heat and use it when needed, so that's how they manage the problem of fluctuating solar irradiance to smooth out electricity production. But in the case of solar panels, there currently isn't any way to affordably store extra energy. That's where traditional power plants come in because to correct for any fluctuations in these solar powered plants, extra electricity from traditional sources always needs to be available. But then why aren't these tradtional power plants just used as a backup, instead of us humans depending on them as our main sources of energy? Because it's impossible for an employee at a coal fired or a nuclear plant to turn a knob to produce more or less electricity depending on how many clouds there are in the sky. The response time would simply be too slow. Instead, to accommodate these fluctuations, some extra electricity from traditional power plants is always being produced. On clear sky days, that extra electricity might be wasted, but when cloudy skies prevail, it's what fills the gap. This is what we currently depend on for a constant supply of energy. For this reason, a lot of researchers are interested in forcasting the motion and formation of clouds through satellite images or cameras that look up at the sky to maximize the energy from solar power plants and minimize energy waste. If we could accomplish that, you'd be able to enjoy this video powered solely by the sun's rays, no matter what the weather, although if the sun is shining, you may be tempted to venture outside to go and do a different kind of cloud gazing.

**Transcript**:
We have some good reasons to completely switch over to solar power. It's cheaper in many cases, and definitely more sustainable than our dependance on traditional power plants that use resources like coal, which will eventually run out. So why don't we replace these traditional plants with solar energy? Because there's one factor that makes solar power very unpredictable: cloud cover. As the sun's rays move towards Earth, some get absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, some are reflected back into outer space, but the rest make it to the Earth's surface. The ones that aren't deviated are called direct irradiance. The ones that are deflected by clouds are called diffuse irradiance. And those rays that first get reflected by a surface, like a nearby building, before reaching the solar energy system are called reflected irradiance. But before we can examine how clouds affect the sun's rays and electricity production, let's see how these solar energy systems work. First up, we have solar towers. These are made up of a central tower surrounded by a huge field of mirrors that track the sun's path and focus only the direct rays onto a single point on the tower, kind of like an eager beachgoer. The heat generated by these rays is so immense that it can be used to boil water producing steam that drives a traditional turbine, which makes electricity. But when we say solar energy systems, we're usually talking about photovoltaics, or solar panels, which are the systems most commonly used to generate solar power. In solar panels, photons from the sun's rays hit the surface of a panel, and electrons are released to get an electric current going. Solar panels can use all types of irradiance, while solar towers can only use direct irradiance, and this is where clouds become important because depending on their type and location relative to the sun, they can either increase or decrease the amount of electricity produced. For instance, even a few cumulus clouds in front of the sun can reduce the electricity production in solar towers to almost zero because of this dependence on direct rays. In solar panels, those clouds would decrease energy output as well, though not as much because solar panels can use all types of irradiance. However, all this depends on the clouds exact positioning. Due to reflection, or a particular phenomeon called Mie scattering, the sun's rays can actually be focused forward by clouds to create a more than 50% increase in the solar irradiance reaching a solar panel. If this potential increase isn't accounted for, it could damage the solar panel. Why does this matter? Well, you wouldn't want this lesson to stop just because a cloud passed over the panel on your roof. In solar towers, huge tanks of molten salt or oil can be used to store any excess heat and use it when needed, so that's how they manage the problem of fluctuating solar irradiance to smooth out electricity production. But in the case of solar panels, there currently isn't any way to affordably store extra energy. That's where traditional power plants come in because to correct for any fluctuations in these solar powered plants, extra electricity from traditional sources always needs to be available. But then why aren't these tradtional power plants just used as a backup, instead of us humans depending on them as our main sources of energy? Because it's impossible for an employee at a coal fired or a nuclear plant to turn a knob to produce more or less electricity depending on how many clouds there are in the sky. The response time would simply be too slow. Instead, to accommodate these fluctuations, some extra electricity from traditional power plants is always being produced. On clear sky days, that extra electricity might be wasted, but when cloudy skies prevail, it's what fills the gap. This is what we currently depend on for a constant supply of energy. For this reason, a lot of researchers are interested in forcasting the motion and formation of clouds through satellite images or cameras that look up at the sky to maximize the energy from solar power plants and minimize energy waste. If we could accomplish that, you'd be able to enjoy this video powered solely by the sun's rays, no matter what the weather, although if the sun is shining, you may be tempted to venture outside to go and do a different kind of cloud gazing.

**Transcript**:
Bees are very busy little matchmakers. Wingmen in every sense of the word. You see, the bees' side of the whole "birds and the bees" business is to help plants find mates and reproduce. In their work as pollinators, honeybees are integral to the production of nearly 1/3 of the food that we eat. And these bees, dutifully helping lonely plants have sex, aren't alone. But rather are part of a very complex network of matchmaking creatures, critical for the pollination of natural ecosystems and crops. Plants in many natural ecosystems need help to have sex. Like many of us, they're too busy to find a relationship. They have too much photosynthesis to do, and they can't find the time to evolve feet and walk to a singles bar. Those places are called meat markets for a reason, because plants can't walk. So they need matchmaker pollinators to transport their pollen grains to flowers of the same plant species, and they pay these pollinators with food. Today, around 170,000 plant species receive pollination services from more than 200,000 pollinator species. Pollinators include many species of bees, butterflies, moths, flies, wasps, beetles, even birds and bats, who together help pollinate many species of trees, shrubs and other flowering plants. In return, flowering plants are an abundant and diverse food source for pollinators. For instance, fossil records suggest bees may have evolved from wasps that gave up hunting after they acquired a taste for nectar. Plant pollinator networks are everywhere. Ecologists record these networks in the field by observing which pollinators visit which plants, or by analyzing the identity of pollen loads on their bodies. Networks, registered in these ways, contain from 20 to 800 species. These networks show a repeated structure, or architecture. Pollinators interact with plants in a very heterogenous way. Most plants are specialists, they have only one or a few matchmakers. Meanwhile, only a few generalist plants hire a diverse team of matchmakers, getting visits from almost all the pollinators of the network. The same occurs with pollinators. Most are specialists that feed on only a few plant species, while a few pollinators, including the honeybee usually, are generalists, busily feeding from and matchmaking for almost all the plant species in that ecosystem. What's interesting is that specialists and generalists across both plants and pollinators, sort themselves out in a particular pattern. Most pollinator networks, for which we have data, are nested. In a nested network, specialists tend to interact more with generalists than with other specialists. This is because if you're a specialist plant, and your only matchmaker also specializes on you as its only food source, you're each more vulnerable to extinction. So, you're better off specializing on a generalist pollinator that has other sources of food to ensure its persistence in bad years. The same goes if you're a specialist pollinator. You're better off in the long run specializing on a generalist plant that gets pollinated by other species in times when you're not around to help. Finally, in addition to nestedness, the networks are usually modular. This means that the species in a network are compartmentalized into modules of plants and animals that interact more with each other than with species in other modules. Think of them like social cliques. A plant or pollinator dying off will effect the species in its module, but those effects will be less severe on the rest of the network. Why's all that important? Because plant pollinator network structure effects the stability of ecosystems. Heterogeneous distribution, nestedness and modularity enable networks to better prevent and respond to extinctions. That's critical because nature is never static. Some species may not show up every year. Plants flower at different times. Pollinators mature on varying schedules. Generalist pollinators have to adapt their preferences depending on who's flowering when. So from one flowering season to the next, the participants and patterns of matchmaking can drastically change. With all those variables, you can understand the importance of generalist pollinators, like bees, to the stability of not only a crop harvest, but the entire network of plants and pollinators we see in nature, and rely on for life. Next time you see a bee fly by, remember that it belongs to a complex network of matchmakers critical to the love lives of plants all around you.

**Transcript**:
Bees are very busy little matchmakers. Wingmen in every sense of the word. You see, the bees' side of the whole "birds and the bees" business is to help plants find mates and reproduce. In their work as pollinators, honeybees are integral to the production of nearly 1/3 of the food that we eat. And these bees, dutifully helping lonely plants have sex, aren't alone. But rather are part of a very complex network of matchmaking creatures, critical for the pollination of natural ecosystems and crops. Plants in many natural ecosystems need help to have sex. Like many of us, they're too busy to find a relationship. They have too much photosynthesis to do, and they can't find the time to evolve feet and walk to a singles bar. Those places are called meat markets for a reason, because plants can't walk. So they need matchmaker pollinators to transport their pollen grains to flowers of the same plant species, and they pay these pollinators with food. Today, around 170,000 plant species receive pollination services from more than 200,000 pollinator species. Pollinators include many species of bees, butterflies, moths, flies, wasps, beetles, even birds and bats, who together help pollinate many species of trees, shrubs and other flowering plants. In return, flowering plants are an abundant and diverse food source for pollinators. For instance, fossil records suggest bees may have evolved from wasps that gave up hunting after they acquired a taste for nectar. Plant pollinator networks are everywhere. Ecologists record these networks in the field by observing which pollinators visit which plants, or by analyzing the identity of pollen loads on their bodies. Networks, registered in these ways, contain from 20 to 800 species. These networks show a repeated structure, or architecture. Pollinators interact with plants in a very heterogenous way. Most plants are specialists, they have only one or a few matchmakers. Meanwhile, only a few generalist plants hire a diverse team of matchmakers, getting visits from almost all the pollinators of the network. The same occurs with pollinators. Most are specialists that feed on only a few plant species, while a few pollinators, including the honeybee usually, are generalists, busily feeding from and matchmaking for almost all the plant species in that ecosystem. What's interesting is that specialists and generalists across both plants and pollinators, sort themselves out in a particular pattern. Most pollinator networks, for which we have data, are nested. In a nested network, specialists tend to interact more with generalists than with other specialists. This is because if you're a specialist plant, and your only matchmaker also specializes on you as its only food source, you're each more vulnerable to extinction. So, you're better off specializing on a generalist pollinator that has other sources of food to ensure its persistence in bad years. The same goes if you're a specialist pollinator. You're better off in the long run specializing on a generalist plant that gets pollinated by other species in times when you're not around to help. Finally, in addition to nestedness, the networks are usually modular. This means that the species in a network are compartmentalized into modules of plants and animals that interact more with each other than with species in other modules. Think of them like social cliques. A plant or pollinator dying off will effect the species in its module, but those effects will be less severe on the rest of the network. Why's all that important? Because plant pollinator network structure effects the stability of ecosystems. Heterogeneous distribution, nestedness and modularity enable networks to better prevent and respond to extinctions. That's critical because nature is never static. Some species may not show up every year. Plants flower at different times. Pollinators mature on varying schedules. Generalist pollinators have to adapt their preferences depending on who's flowering when. So from one flowering season to the next, the participants and patterns of matchmaking can drastically change. With all those variables, you can understand the importance of generalist pollinators, like bees, to the stability of not only a crop harvest, but the entire network of plants and pollinators we see in nature, and rely on for life. Next time you see a bee fly by, remember that it belongs to a complex network of matchmakers critical to the love lives of plants all around you.

**Transcript**:
It's only been the last few hundreds years or so that Western civilization has been putting art in museums, at least museums resembling the public institutions we know today. Before this, for most, art served other purposes. What we call fine art today was, in fact, primarily how people experienced an aesthetic dimension of religion. Paintings, sculpture, textiles and illuminations were the media of their time, supplying vivid imagery to accompany the stories of the day. In this sense, Western art shared a utilitarian purpose with other cultures around the world, some of whose languages incidentally have no word for art. So how do we define what we call art? Generally speaking, what we're talking about here is work that visually communicates meaning beyond language, either through representation or the arrangement of visual elements in space. Evidence of this power of iconography, or ability of images to convey meaning, can be found in abundance if we look at art from the histories of our major world religions. Almost all have, at one time or another in their history, gone through some sort of aniconic phase. Aniconism prohibits any visual depiction of the divine. This is done in order to avoid idolatry, or confusion between the representation of divinity and divinity itself. Keeping it real, so to speak, in the relationship between the individual and the divine. However, this can be a challenge to maintain, given that the urge to visually represent and interpret the world around us is a compulsion difficult to suppress. For example, even today, where the depiction of Allah or the Prophet Muhammad is prohibited, an abstract celebration of the divine can still be found in arabesque patterns of Islamic textile design, with masterful flourishes of brushwork and Arabic calligraphy, where the words of the prophet assume a dual role as both literature and visual art. Likewise, in art from the early periods of Christianity and Buddhism, the divine presence of the Christ and the Buddha do not appear in human form but are represented by symbols. In each case, iconographic reference is employed as a form of reverence. Anthropomorphic representation, or depiction in human form, eventually became widespread in these religions only centuries later, under the influence of the cultural traditions surrounding them. Historically speaking, the public appreciation of visual art in terms other than traditional, religious or social function is a relatively new concept. Today, we fetishize the fetish, so to speak. We go to museums to see art from the ages, but our experience of it there is drastically removed from the context in which it was originally intended to be seen. It might be said that the modern viewer lacks the richness of engagement that she has with contemporary art, which has been created relevant to her time and speaks her cultural language. It might also be said that the history of what we call art is a conversation that continues on, as our contemporary present passes into what will be some future generation's classical past. It's a conversation that reflects the ideologies, mythologies, belief systems and taboos and so much more of the world in which it was made. But this is not to say that work from another age made to serve a particular function in that time is dead or has nothing to offer the modern viewer. Even though in a museum setting works of art from different places and times are presented alongside each other, isolated from their original settings, their juxtaposition has benefits. Exhibits are organized by curators, or people who've made a career out of their ability to recontextualize or remix cultural artifacts in a collective presentation. As viewers, we're then able to consider the art in terms of a common theme that might not be apparent in a particular work until you see it alongside another, and new meanings can be derived and reflected upon. If we're so inclined, we might even start to see every work of art as a complementary part of some undefined, unified whole of past human experience, a trail that leads right to our doorstep and continues on with us, open to anyone who wants to explore it.
