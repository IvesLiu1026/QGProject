**Transcript**:
Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue
submarine was the easy part. Hacking into the nuclear missile launch
override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: 
you don’t have the override code. You know you need 
the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used
to authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, 
you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion 
with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, 
the other to minion B, and forbade them to share 
the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number 
and activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left
before the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— 
your launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive
integers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum
to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter 
to override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are
notoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself 
in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities 
based on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably
have something with the potential to reveal A’s number,
but isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, 
but it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know
A’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way 
to factor B’s number. Try factoring a few 
and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product
must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember 
is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities 
from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through
unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums
can result from its factors, then break those apart 
and see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar 
going from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know— 
when A made his first statement, he must have been holding
either 5 or 6. B has access to the same information 
we do, so he knows this too. Let’s review what’s in each
brain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum,
but only B knows the product. Now let’s look at the first part 
of B’s statement. What if A’s number was 5? That could be from 1+4 or 2+3, in which case B would have
either 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make
the product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken 
down three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,
but 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know
whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option 
because it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4
could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A 
would be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,
so B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether
B had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half 
of what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override 
the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub 
to the bottom of the ocean.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically chimerism and genetics, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to a logic puzzle involving two minions and a nuclear missile launch.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar in terms of format, but it's not similar in terms of content or intent.

must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember 
is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities 
from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through
unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums
can result from its factors, then break those apart 
and see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar 
going from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know— 
when A made his first statement, he must have been holding
either 5 or 6. B has access to the same information 
we do, so he knows this too. Let’s review what’s in each
brain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum,
but only B knows the product. Now let’s look at the first part 
of B’s statement. What if A’s number was 5? That could be from 1+4 or 2+3, in which case B would have
either 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make
the product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken 
down three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,
but 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know
whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option 
because it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4
could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A 
would be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,
so B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether
B had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half 
of what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override 
the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub 
to the bottom of the ocean.

**Transcript**:
Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue
submarine was the easy part. Hacking into the nuclear missile launch
override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: 
you don’t have the override code. You know you need 
the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used
to authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, 
you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion 
with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, 
the other to minion B, and forbade them to share 
the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number 
and activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left
before the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— 
your launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive
integers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum
to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter 
to override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are
notoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself 
in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities 
based on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably
have something with the potential to reveal A’s number,
but isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, 
but it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know
A’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way 
to factor B’s number. Try factoring a few 
and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product
must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember

**Transcript**:
While searching for a kidney donor, a Boston woman named Karen Keegan 
stumbled upon a mystery. When her three adult sons
underwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match
for kidney donation, the test showed that two of them
weren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, 
her doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something 
even more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second 
genome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had 
a completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged 
to her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, 
where an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam
of three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have 
two-toned skin or hair, or two different colored eyes, but most are believed to have no visible
signs of the condition. Chimerism can come from a twin in utero,
from a tissue or organ transplant, or happen between a fetus 
and a pregnant woman. So how exactly does it happen? In one of the most common forms, a mother and fetus swap cells 
in the flow of nutrients across the placenta. The mother can inherit fetal stem cells, undifferentiated cells that are able 
to develop into any specialized cell. The fetal cells initially go undetected because the mother’s immune system 
is suppressed during pregnancy. But in some cases, cells 
with the fetus’s DNA persist in the mother’s body 
for years or even decades without being destroyed
by her immune system. In one case, a mother's liver was failing, but suddenly started to regenerate itself. Her doctors biopsied her liver,
and found DNA in the regenerated tissue from a pregnancy almost 20 years earlier. The fetal stem cells had lodged in her
liver and specialized as liver cells. Karen Keegan, meanwhile, acquired 
her second genome before she was born. Very early in her own mother’s pregnancy
with her, Keegan had a fraternal twin. Keegan’s embryo absorbed some 
fetal stem cells from her twin’s embryo, which did not develop to term. By the time Keegan’s fetus 
developed an immune system, it had many cells with each genome, and the immune system recognized
both genomes as her body’s own— so it didn’t attack or destroy the cells
with the second genome. We don’t know how much of her body was
composed of cells with this second genome— that can vary from one organ to another,
and even between tissues within an organ: some might have no cells at all
with the second genome, while others might have many. At least some of the egg-producing tissue
in her ovaries must have carried the second genome. Each time she conceived there would be 
no way to predict which genome would be involved— which is how two of her children
ended up with the genes of a woman who had never been born. This can also happen to fathers. In 2014, when ancestry testing 
determined that a father was actually his baby’s biological uncle, researchers discovered that 10%
of the father’s sperm carried a second genome 
from an embryonic twin. Cases like this challenge 
our perception of genetics. Though there are very few documented cases
of chimerism from an embryonic twin, we’re all amalgams to some extent, carrying around the different genetic
codes of our gut bacteria and even our mitochondria. And given that 1 in 8 individual births
started out as twin pregnancies, there could be many more people
with two genomes— and many more lessons to learn
about the genes that make us who we are.

**Transcript**:
While searching for a kidney donor, a Boston woman named Karen Keegan 
stumbled upon a mystery. When her three adult sons
underwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match
for kidney donation, the test showed that two of them
weren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, 
her doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something 
even more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second 
genome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had 
a completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged 
to her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, 
where an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam
of three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have 
two-toned skin or hair, or two different colored eyes, but most are believed to have no visible
signs of the condition. Chimerism can come from a twin in utero,
from a tissue or organ transplant, or happen between a fetus 
and a pregnant woman. So how exactly does it happen? In one of the most common forms, a mother and fetus swap cells 
in the flow of nutrients across the placenta. The mother can inherit fetal stem cells, undifferentiated cells that are able 
to develop into any specialized cell. The fetal cells initially go undetected because the mother’s immune system 
is suppressed during pregnancy. But in some cases, cells 
with the fetus’s DNA persist in the mother’s body 
for years or even decades without being destroyed
by her immune system. In one case, a mother's liver was failing, but suddenly started to regenerate itself. Her doctors biopsied her liver,
and found DNA in the regenerated tissue from a pregnancy almost 20 years earlier. The fetal stem cells had lodged in her
liver and specialized as liver cells. Karen Keegan, meanwhile, acquired 
her second genome before she was born. Very early in her own mother’s pregnancy
with her, Keegan had a fraternal twin. Keegan’s embryo absorbed some 
fetal stem cells from her twin’s embryo, which did not develop to term. By the time Keegan’s fetus 
developed an immune system, it had many cells with each genome, and the immune system recognized
both genomes as her body’s own— so it didn’t attack or destroy the cells
with the second genome. We don’t know how much of her body was
composed of cells with this second genome— that can vary from one organ to another,
and even between tissues within an organ: some might have no cells at all
with the second genome, while others might have many. At least some of the egg-producing tissue
in her ovaries must have carried the second genome. Each time she conceived there would be 
no way to predict which genome would be involved— which is how two of her children
ended up with the genes of a woman who had never been born. This can also happen to fathers. In 2014, when ancestry testing 
determined that a father was actually his baby’s biological uncle, researchers discovered that 10%
of the father’s sperm carried a second genome 
from an embryonic twin. Cases like this challenge 
our perception of genetics. Though there are very few documented cases
of chimerism from an embryonic twin, we’re all amalgams to some extent, carrying around the different genetic
codes of our gut bacteria and even our mitochondria. And given that 1 in 8 individual births
started out as twin pregnancies, there could be many more people
with two genomes— and many more lessons to learn
about the genes that make us who we are.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is about the origin of the term "Chimerism," which is not related to any of the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs have a similar intent or content to the ground truth MCQ. But if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 7 is the least dissimilar, only because it is the only question that has a somewhat similar format (a question about a term or concept with multiple-choice options), but it is still completely unrelated to the ground truth MCQ.

So, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ for the given ground truth MCQ.

Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue
submarine was the easy part. Hacking into the nuclear missile launch
override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: 
you don’t have the override code. You know you need 
the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used
to authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, 
you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion 
with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, 
the other to minion B, and forbade them to share 
the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number 
and activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left
before the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— 
your launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive
integers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum
to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter 
to override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are
notoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself 
in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities 
based on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably
have something with the potential to reveal A’s number,
but isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, 
but it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know
A’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way 
to factor B’s number. Try factoring a few 
and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product
must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember 
is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities 
from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through
unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums
can result from its factors, then break those apart 
and see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar 
going from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know— 
when A made his first statement, he must have been holding
either 5 or 6. B has access to the same information 
we do, so he knows this too. Let’s review what’s in each
brain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum,
but only B knows the product. Now let’s look at the first part 
of B’s statement. What if A’s number was 5? That could be from 1+4 or 2+3, in which case B would have
either 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make
the product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken 
down three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,
but 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know
whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option 
because it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4
could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A 
would be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,
so B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether
B had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half 
of what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override 
the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub 
to the bottom of the ocean.

**Transcript**:
Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue
submarine was the easy part. Hacking into the nuclear missile launch
override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: 
you don’t have the override code. You know you need 
the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used
to authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, 
you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion 
with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, 
the other to minion B, and forbade them to share 
the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number 
and activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left
before the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— 
your launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive
integers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum
to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter 
to override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are
notoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself 
in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities 
based on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably
have something with the potential to reveal A’s number,
but isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, 
but it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know
A’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way 
to factor B’s number. Try factoring a few 
and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product
must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember 
is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities 
from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through
unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums
can result from its factors, then break those apart 
and see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar 
going from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know—

Therefore, the scores are very low. A better approach would be to generate a new MCQ that is relevant to the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
While searching for a kidney donor, a Boston woman named Karen Keegan 
stumbled upon a mystery. When her three adult sons
underwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match
for kidney donation, the test showed that two of them
weren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, 
her doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something 
even more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second 
genome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had 
a completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged 
to her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, 
where an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam
of three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have 
two-toned skin or hair, or two different colored eyes, but most are believed to have no visible
signs of the condition. Chimerism can come from a twin in utero,
from a tissue or organ transplant, or happen between a fetus 
and a pregnant woman. So how exactly does it happen? In one of the most common forms, a mother and fetus swap cells 
in the flow of nutrients across the placenta. The mother can inherit fetal stem cells, undifferentiated cells that are able 
to develop into any specialized cell. The fetal cells initially go undetected because the mother’s immune system 
is suppressed during pregnancy. But in some cases, cells 
with the fetus’s DNA persist in the mother’s body 
for years or even decades without being destroyed
by her immune system. In one case, a mother's liver was failing, but suddenly started to regenerate itself. Her doctors biopsied her liver,
and found DNA in the regenerated tissue from a pregnancy almost 20 years earlier. The fetal stem cells had lodged in her
liver and specialized as liver cells. Karen Keegan, meanwhile, acquired 
her second genome before she was born. Very early in her own mother’s pregnancy
with her, Keegan had a fraternal twin. Keegan’s embryo absorbed some 
fetal stem cells from her twin’s embryo, which did not develop to term. By the time Keegan’s fetus 
developed an immune system, it had many cells with each genome, and the immune system recognized
both genomes as her body’s own— so it didn’t attack or destroy the cells
with the second genome. We don’t know how much of her body was
composed of cells with this second genome— that can vary from one organ to another,
and even between tissues within an organ: some might have no cells at all
with the second genome, while others might have many. At least some of the egg-producing tissue
in her ovaries must have carried the second genome. Each time she conceived there would be 
no way to predict which genome would be involved— which is how two of her children
ended up with the genes of a woman who had never been born. This can also happen to fathers. In 2014, when ancestry testing 
determined that a father was actually his baby’s biological uncle, researchers discovered that 10%
of the father’s sperm carried a second genome 
from an embryonic twin. Cases like this challenge 
our perception of genetics. Though there are very few documented cases
of chimerism from an embryonic twin, we’re all amalgams to some extent, carrying around the different genetic
codes of our gut bacteria and even our mitochondria. And given that 1 in 8 individual births
started out as twin pregnancies, there could be many more people
with two genomes— and many more lessons to learn
about the genes that make us who we are.
