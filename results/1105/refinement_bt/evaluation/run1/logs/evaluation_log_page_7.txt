**Transcript**:
If you were a jackrabbit hopping 
through the desert, you’d be glad to stumble— 
well, maybe not stumble— across a cactus: the succulent flesh 
of these plants is a water source for many desert animals. Native to the Americas and known 
for their spines and succulent stems, cacti of all shapes and sizes have evolved
to not just survive, but thrive, in some of the harshest desert climates 
on Earth. So how do they do it? A cactus’s spines are one
key to its survival— but not for the reason you might think. Take a look at the prickly pear. Its spines are highly modified leaves. A normal leaf’s large surface area would
be ill-suited to the desert, transpiring massive amounts 
of water under the baking sun. The dramatically reduced surface area
of the spines limits water loss. They also shade the cactus 
and reflect the sun’s rays, reducing the plant's core temperature
during the heat of the day. Then, at night, 
when air temperatures plummet, the spines act as an insulating layer, keeping the cactus from cooling 
down too much. These functions are just as important,
if not more, than defending against predators. From Cuba to Mexico, and as far south 
as Brazil and Peru, Melon cacti grow on limestone soils 
in seasonally dry tropical forests, where they're constantly exposed
to the beating sun. They rely on another adaptation
common to cacti: a thick skin, which is coated in a waxy substance
called a cuticle that limits water loss. Meanwhile, the stomata— tiny holes that allow the exchange
of gases that enable photosynthesis— remain firmly closed 
until night when they open. The lower temperatures at night 
mean the cactus loses less water from the stem when the stomata open. The bulk of the plant acts 
as a large barrel of water, storing it for times of need. But to survive the desert, 
a cactus can’t just limit water loss— it has to be prepared 
to take full advantage of the rare situations where water
is readily available. In North America’s Sonoran Desert, the towering Saguaro cactus can grow
up to 20 meters tall and live for up to 200 years. Woody tissue, like the kind found 
in tree trunks, give the Saguaro its height, but the Saguaro survives 
with way less water than most trees. Most of its roots are only 
a few inches deep. Just below the soil’s surface, 
they spread out laterally for meters and hold the plant in place. Even its single deepest root,
the taproot, extends less than one meter 
into the ground. After a rain, the lateral roots
respond in real time, rapidly growing and spreading. They produce ephemeral rain roots 
that quickly take up the available water. The water is then pulled
up into the plant body and stored in cells that contain mucilage, a gluey substance that clings 
to water molecules and stops them from evaporating 
if the plant’s tissue is ever damaged and exposed. As the soil dries after the rain, the small rain roots also start to dry 
and wither away, and the cactus awaits the next time
it can take advantage of a shower. Taken together, these features make cacti
well-equipped to survive their environments, from the driest desert
to... a tropical rainforest? The mistletoe cactus can live on the
branches of trees in the rainforest. Though there’s lots of water around,
not much of it reaches the cactus here, and there's nowhere for its roots to go. So even here, the cactus survives 
using adaptations that long ago helped its ancestors 
survive the desert.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to electric vehicles, while the ground truth MCQ is about cacti and their adaptations.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in terms of question style and format, I would choose Question 1: **Knowledge**: What was the primary problem with early electric vehicles? Options: A. They were too expensive to maintain., B. They had inefficient batteries., C. They were too heavy to transport., D. They were too loud to drive. Correct Option: B

But please note that this is a very loose match, and the question intent, options, and content are not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say Question 1 (Index 1), but again, this is not a good match.

It would be better to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of cacti and their adaptations, rather than trying to match the ground truth MCQ with the existing generated MCQs.

called a cuticle that limits water loss. Meanwhile, the stomata— tiny holes that allow the exchange
of gases that enable photosynthesis— remain firmly closed 
until night when they open. The lower temperatures at night 
mean the cactus loses less water from the stem when the stomata open. The bulk of the plant acts 
as a large barrel of water, storing it for times of need. But to survive the desert, 
a cactus can’t just limit water loss— it has to be prepared 
to take full advantage of the rare situations where water
is readily available. In North America’s Sonoran Desert, the towering Saguaro cactus can grow
up to 20 meters tall and live for up to 200 years. Woody tissue, like the kind found 
in tree trunks, give the Saguaro its height, but the Saguaro survives 
with way less water than most trees. Most of its roots are only 
a few inches deep. Just below the soil’s surface, 
they spread out laterally for meters and hold the plant in place. Even its single deepest root,
the taproot, extends less than one meter 
into the ground. After a rain, the lateral roots
respond in real time, rapidly growing and spreading. They produce ephemeral rain roots 
that quickly take up the available water. The water is then pulled
up into the plant body and stored in cells that contain mucilage, a gluey substance that clings 
to water molecules and stops them from evaporating 
if the plant’s tissue is ever damaged and exposed. As the soil dries after the rain, the small rain roots also start to dry 
and wither away, and the cactus awaits the next time
it can take advantage of a shower. Taken together, these features make cacti
well-equipped to survive their environments, from the driest desert
to... a tropical rainforest? The mistletoe cactus can live on the
branches of trees in the rainforest. Though there’s lots of water around,
not much of it reaches the cactus here, and there's nowhere for its roots to go. So even here, the cactus survives 
using adaptations that long ago helped its ancestors 
survive the desert.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to electric vehicles, while the ground truth MCQ is about cacti.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in terms of question type (knowledge-based) and format, I would choose Question 7: **Knowledge**: Who was one of the inventors who tried to build batteries that stored more electricity? Options: A. Thomas Edison., B. Nikola Tesla., C. Henry Ford., D. Guglielmo Marconi. Correct Option: A

But please note that this is a very loose match, and the question intent, options, and content are not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say Question 7 (Index 7), but again, this is not a good match.

It would be better to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of cacti and their adaptations, as described in the transcript.

**Transcript**:
If you were a jackrabbit hopping 
through the desert, you’d be glad to stumble— 
well, maybe not stumble— across a cactus: the succulent flesh 
of these plants is a water source for many desert animals. Native to the Americas and known 
for their spines and succulent stems, cacti of all shapes and sizes have evolved
to not just survive, but thrive, in some of the harshest desert climates 
on Earth. So how do they do it? A cactus’s spines are one
key to its survival— but not for the reason you might think. Take a look at the prickly pear. Its spines are highly modified leaves. A normal leaf’s large surface area would
be ill-suited to the desert, transpiring massive amounts 
of water under the baking sun. The dramatically reduced surface area
of the spines limits water loss. They also shade the cactus 
and reflect the sun’s rays, reducing the plant's core temperature
during the heat of the day. Then, at night, 
when air temperatures plummet, the spines act as an insulating layer, keeping the cactus from cooling 
down too much. These functions are just as important,
if not more, than defending against predators. From Cuba to Mexico, and as far south 
as Brazil and Peru, Melon cacti grow on limestone soils 
in seasonally dry tropical forests, where they're constantly exposed
to the beating sun. They rely on another adaptation
common to cacti: a thick skin, which is coated in a waxy substance
called a cuticle that limits water loss. Meanwhile, the stomata— tiny holes that allow the exchange
of gases that enable photosynthesis— remain firmly closed 
until night when they open. The lower temperatures at night 
mean the cactus loses less water from the stem when the stomata open. The bulk of the plant acts 
as a large barrel of water, storing it for times of need. But to survive the desert, 
a cactus can’t just limit water loss— it has to be prepared 
to take full advantage of the rare situations where water
is readily available. In North America’s Sonoran Desert, the towering Saguaro cactus can grow
up to 20 meters tall and live for up to 200 years. Woody tissue, like the kind found

**Transcript**:
If you were buying a car in 1899, you would’ve had three major
options to choose from. You could buy a steam-powered car. Typically relying on gas-powered boilers, 
these could drive as far as you wanted— provided you also wanted to lug
around extra water to refuel and didn’t mind waiting 30 minutes
for your engine to heat up. Alternatively, you could buy
a car powered by gasoline. However, the internal combustion engines
in these models required dangerous hand-cranking to start and emitted loud noises
and foul-smelling exhaust while driving. So your best bet was probably
option number three: a battery-powered electric vehicle. These cars were quick to start,
clean and quiet to run, and if you lived somewhere with access 
to electricity, easy to refuel overnight. If this seems like an easy choice,
you're not alone. By the end of the 19th century, 
nearly 40% of American cars were electric. In cities with early electric systems, battery-powered cars were 
a popular and reliable alternative to their occasionally explosive 
competitors. But electric vehicles had one
major problem— batteries. Early car batteries were expensive
and inefficient. Many inventors, including Thomas Edison, tried to build batteries 
that stored more electricity. Others even built exchange stations 
in urban areas to swap out dead batteries for charged ones. But these measures weren’t enough to allow
electric vehicles to make long trips. And at over twice the price 
of a gas-powered car, many couldn’t afford these luxury items. At the same time, oil discoveries
lowered the price of gasoline, and new advances made internal combustion
engines more appealing. Electric starters removed the need
for hand-cranking, mufflers made engines quieter and 
rubber engine mounts reduced vibration. In 1908, Ford released the Model T; a cheap, high-quality gas-powered car 
that captured the public imagination. By 1915, the percentage of electric cars
on the road had plummeted. For the next 55 years, internal combustion
engines ruled the roads. Aside from some special-purpose vehicles,
electric cars were nowhere to be found. However, in the 1970s, 
the tide began to turn. US concerns about oil availability renewed
interest in alternative energy sources. And studies in the 1980s linking 
car emissions with smog in cities like Los Angeles encouraged governments 
and environmental organizations to reconsider electric vehicles. At this point, car companies had spent
decades investing in internal combustion engines 
without devoting any resources to solving the century-old 
battery problem. But other companies were developing
increasingly efficient batteries to power a new wave 
of portable electronics. By the 1990s, energy dense nickel metal
hydride batteries were on the market, soon followed by lithium-ion batteries. Alongside regulatory mandates 
by California to reduce smog, these innovations sparked a small wave
of new electric vehicles, including hybrid cars. Hybrids aren’t true electric vehicles; their nickel metal hydride batteries are only used to optimize 
the efficiency of gas-burning engines. But in 2008, Tesla Motors went further, grabbing the attention of consumers, 
automakers, and regulators with its lithium-ion-powered Roadster. This purely electric vehicle could travel 
more than 320 kilometers on a single charge, almost doubling the previous record. Since then, electric vehicles have 
vastly improved in cost, performance, efficiency, and availability. They can accelerate much faster
than gas-powered sports cars, and while some models still
have a high upfront cost, they reliably save their drivers money
in the long run. As governments around the world focus 
on slowing climate change, electric vehicles are now expected 
to replace gas-powered ones altogether. In Norway, 75% of car sales in 2020 
were plug-in electric vehicles. And policies such as California’s
Zero Emission Vehicle mandate and Europe’s aggressive 
CO2 emission standards have dramatically slowed investments 
in gas-powered vehicles worldwide. Soon, electric cars will reclaim 
their place on the road, putting gasoline in our rearview.

**Transcript**:
If you were buying a car in 1899, you would’ve had three major
options to choose from. You could buy a steam-powered car. Typically relying on gas-powered boilers, 
these could drive as far as you wanted— provided you also wanted to lug
around extra water to refuel and didn’t mind waiting 30 minutes
for your engine to heat up. Alternatively, you could buy
a car powered by gasoline. However, the internal combustion engines
in these models required dangerous hand-cranking to start and emitted loud noises
and foul-smelling exhaust while driving. So your best bet was probably
option number three: a battery-powered electric vehicle. These cars were quick to start,
clean and quiet to run, and if you lived somewhere with access 
to electricity, easy to refuel overnight. If this seems like an easy choice,
you're not alone. By the end of the 19th century, 
nearly 40% of American cars were electric. In cities with early electric systems, battery-powered cars were 
a popular and reliable alternative to their occasionally explosive 
competitors. But electric vehicles had one
major problem— batteries. Early car batteries were expensive
and inefficient. Many inventors, including Thomas Edison, tried to build batteries 
that stored more electricity. Others even built exchange stations 
in urban areas to swap out dead batteries for charged ones. But these measures weren’t enough to allow
electric vehicles to make long trips. And at over twice the price 
of a gas-powered car, many couldn’t afford these luxury items. At the same time, oil discoveries
lowered the price of gasoline, and new advances made internal combustion
engines more appealing. Electric starters removed the need
for hand-cranking, mufflers made engines quieter and 
rubber engine mounts reduced vibration. In 1908, Ford released the Model T; a cheap, high-quality gas-powered car 
that captured the public imagination. By 1915, the percentage of electric cars
on the road had plummeted. For the next 55 years, internal combustion
engines ruled the roads. Aside from some special-purpose vehicles,
electric cars were nowhere to be found. However, in the 1970s, 
the tide began to turn. US concerns about oil availability renewed
interest in alternative energy sources. And studies in the 1980s linking 
car emissions with smog in cities like Los Angeles encouraged governments 
and environmental organizations to reconsider electric vehicles. At this point, car companies had spent
decades investing in internal combustion engines 
without devoting any resources to solving the century-old 
battery problem. But other companies were developing
increasingly efficient batteries to power a new wave 
of portable electronics. By the 1990s, energy dense nickel metal
hydride batteries were on the market, soon followed by lithium-ion batteries. Alongside regulatory mandates 
by California to reduce smog, these innovations sparked a small wave
of new electric vehicles, including hybrid cars. Hybrids aren’t true electric vehicles; their nickel metal hydride batteries are only used to optimize 
the efficiency of gas-burning engines. But in 2008, Tesla Motors went further, grabbing the attention of consumers, 
automakers, and regulators with its lithium-ion-powered Roadster. This purely electric vehicle could travel 
more than 320 kilometers on a single charge, almost doubling the previous record. Since then, electric vehicles have 
vastly improved in cost, performance, efficiency, and availability. They can accelerate much faster
than gas-powered sports cars, and while some models still
have a high upfront cost, they reliably save their drivers money
in the long run. As governments around the world focus 
on slowing climate change, electric vehicles are now expected 
to replace gas-powered ones altogether. In Norway, 75% of car sales in 2020 
were plug-in electric vehicles. And policies such as California’s
Zero Emission Vehicle mandate and Europe’s aggressive 
CO2 emission standards have dramatically slowed investments 
in gas-powered vehicles worldwide. Soon, electric cars will reclaim 
their place on the road, putting gasoline in our rearview.

**Transcript**:
Mohammadpur has always had 
a unique relationship with the weather. Located at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, this coastal village was built 
on top of the Meghna River delta. Deltas are a kind of landmass formed 
when sediment carried by rivers is deposited where that river meets 
a larger body of water. River deltas are incredibly fertile
ecosystems capable of supporting abundant agriculture
and marine life. However, their borders gradually change
as rivers bring more sediment in and storms wash sediment away. The residents of Mohammadpur are well
accustomed to managing the ebbs and flows of this ever-shifting
landscape. But lately, an abundance of intense
cyclones have caused frequent flooding that impedes farming and fishing. These floods also erode the coastline, allowing later storms to wipe
away land altogether. Since 2000, the Meghna River has overtaken
the coastline by 2.5 kilometers, forcing many villagers to move inland
or to nearby cities. Mohammadpur isn’t the only place 
where erratic weather is impacting people’s mobility. Repeated typhoons in the Philippines have 
displaced thousands from their homes. In Fiji, the government is already moving
many coastal villages inland to get ahead of predicted land loss. And in the United States, melting permafrost is causing chunks
of the Alaskan coastline to erode. In some ways, this is nothing new. Humanity has always adapted
to changing weather and moved to regions that best support
cultural lifestyles and livelihoods. However, scientists agree 
that this rise in extreme weather is a by-product of Earth’s 
rapidly changing climate. Global warming increases the frequency and
intensity of storms, flooding and drought, while also melting polar ice caps 
and raising sea levels. These factors are changing the environment
much faster than they have in the past. Even for communities with the resources 
to take action, the variable pace and nature of these
changes makes them difficult to adapt to. And the vulnerable populations most
impacted by climate change are often those least responsible. Many facing climate mobility live 
in farming and fishing communities in countries that generate dramatically 
fewer emissions than their larger counterparts. Bangladesh is one such country. The nation has a unique combination
of low-lying geography and heavily populated coastal regions. Most of these vulnerable coastal families,
like those in Mohammadpur, don’t want to abandon 
their homes and livelihoods. And for others, leaving Bangladesh
isn’t financially practical. So to stay with their communities, many have moved a few meters inland and built more resilient homes
on higher ground or elevated stilts. Others have tried to buy land on newly
emerging islands in the delta, while some have sent family members
to find work in nearby cities. A handful of individuals might even cross
international borders, if they have family, friends, or work 
connections on the other side. But many of the residents who’ve left
are eager to return home. Unfortunately, it's unclear when
weather extremes will die down, and the government has repeatedly delayed
projects to build concrete embankments that would prevent further erosion. In other parts of the world, people couldn’t move inland 
even if they wanted to. The low-lying Pacific Island nations 
of Kiribati and Tuvalu are only 811 square kilometers
and 26 square kilometers, respectively; so migration would mean moving 
to a different country altogether. Instead, their governments and citizens
have united in physically, legally, and politically 
fortifying their countries. Island residents are planting
coastal mangrove forests, and building up low-lying areas of land
with dredged sand to shield themselves against storms 
and rising sea levels. And the islands’ governments have
repeatedly lobbied on the global stage for countries with the highest emissions 
to reduce pollution and take responsibility 
for climate change. The challenges facing
each coastal community are unique, and the diversity of the people's
experiences can make climate mobility a difficult phenomenon 
to measure and define. But as new communities are endangered
by extreme weather, it’s more important than ever
to listen to those on the front lines of this crisis.

**Transcript**:
Mohammadpur has always had 
a unique relationship with the weather. Located at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, this coastal village was built 
on top of the Meghna River delta. Deltas are a kind of landmass formed 
when sediment carried by rivers is deposited where that river meets 
a larger body of water. River deltas are incredibly fertile
ecosystems capable of supporting abundant agriculture
and marine life. However, their borders gradually change
as rivers bring more sediment in and storms wash sediment away. The residents of Mohammadpur are well
accustomed to managing the ebbs and flows of this ever-shifting
landscape. But lately, an abundance of intense
cyclones have caused frequent flooding that impedes farming and fishing. These floods also erode the coastline, allowing later storms to wipe
away land altogether. Since 2000, the Meghna River has overtaken
the coastline by 2.5 kilometers, forcing many villagers to move inland
or to nearby cities. Mohammadpur isn’t the only place 
where erratic weather is impacting people’s mobility. Repeated typhoons in the Philippines have 
displaced thousands from their homes. In Fiji, the government is already moving
many coastal villages inland to get ahead of predicted land loss. And in the United States, melting permafrost is causing chunks
of the Alaskan coastline to erode. In some ways, this is nothing new. Humanity has always adapted
to changing weather and moved to regions that best support
cultural lifestyles and livelihoods. However, scientists agree 
that this rise in extreme weather is a by-product of Earth’s 
rapidly changing climate. Global warming increases the frequency and
intensity of storms, flooding and drought, while also melting polar ice caps 
and raising sea levels. These factors are changing the environment
much faster than they have in the past. Even for communities with the resources 
to take action, the variable pace and nature of these
changes makes them difficult to adapt to. And the vulnerable populations most
impacted by climate change are often those least responsible. Many facing climate mobility live 
in farming and fishing communities in countries that generate dramatically 
fewer emissions than their larger counterparts. Bangladesh is one such country. The nation has a unique combination
of low-lying geography and heavily populated coastal regions. Most of these vulnerable coastal families,
like those in Mohammadpur, don’t want to abandon 
their homes and livelihoods. And for others, leaving Bangladesh
isn’t financially practical. So to stay with their communities, many have moved a few meters inland and built more resilient homes
on higher ground or elevated stilts. Others have tried to buy land on newly
emerging islands in the delta, while some have sent family members
to find work in nearby cities. A handful of individuals might even cross
international borders, if they have family, friends, or work 
connections on the other side. But many of the residents who’ve left
are eager to return home. Unfortunately, it's unclear when
weather extremes will die down, and the government has repeatedly delayed
projects to build concrete embankments that would prevent further erosion. In other parts of the world, people couldn’t move inland 
even if they wanted to. The low-lying Pacific Island nations 
of Kiribati and Tuvalu are only 811 square kilometers
and 26 square kilometers, respectively; so migration would mean moving 
to a different country altogether. Instead, their governments and citizens
have united in physically, legally, and politically 
fortifying their countries. Island residents are planting
coastal mangrove forests, and building up low-lying areas of land
with dredged sand to shield themselves against storms 
and rising sea levels. And the islands’ governments have
repeatedly lobbied on the global stage for countries with the highest emissions 
to reduce pollution and take responsibility 
for climate change. The challenges facing
each coastal community are unique, and the diversity of the people's
experiences can make climate mobility a difficult phenomenon 
to measure and define. But as new communities are endangered
by extreme weather, it’s more important than ever
to listen to those on the front lines of this crisis.

**Transcript**:
Mohammadpur has always had 
a unique relationship with the weather. Located at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, this coastal village was built 
on top of the Meghna River delta. Deltas are a kind of landmass formed 
when sediment carried by rivers is deposited where that river meets 
a larger body of water. River deltas are incredibly fertile
ecosystems capable of supporting abundant agriculture
and marine life. However, their borders gradually change
as rivers bring more sediment in and storms wash sediment away. The residents of Mohammadpur are well
accustomed to managing the ebbs and flows of this ever-shifting
landscape. But lately, an abundance of intense
cyclones have caused frequent flooding that impedes farming and fishing. These floods also erode the coastline, allowing later storms to wipe
away land altogether. Since 2000, the Meghna River has overtaken
the coastline by 2.5 kilometers, forcing many villagers to move inland
or to nearby cities. Mohammadpur isn’t the only place 
where erratic weather is impacting people’s mobility. Repeated typhoons in the Philippines have 
displaced thousands from their homes. In Fiji, the government is already moving
many coastal villages inland to get ahead of predicted land loss. And in the United States, melting permafrost is causing chunks
of the Alaskan coastline to erode. In some ways, this is nothing new. Humanity has always adapted
to changing weather and moved to regions that best support
cultural lifestyles and livelihoods. However, scientists agree 
that this rise in extreme weather is a by-product of Earth’s 
rapidly changing climate. Global warming increases the frequency and
intensity of storms, flooding and drought, while also melting polar ice caps 
and raising sea levels. These factors are changing the environment
much faster than they have in the past. Even for communities with the resources 
to take action, the variable pace and nature of these
changes makes them difficult to adapt to. And the vulnerable populations most
impacted by climate change are often those least responsible. Many facing climate mobility live 
in farming and fishing communities in countries that generate dramatically 
fewer emissions than their larger counterparts. Bangladesh is one such country. The nation has a unique combination
of low-lying geography and heavily populated coastal regions. Most of these vulnerable coastal families,
like those in Mohammadpur, don’t want to abandon 
their homes and livelihoods. And for others, leaving Bangladesh
isn’t financially practical. So to stay with their communities, many have moved a few meters inland and built more resilient homes
on higher ground or elevated stilts. Others have tried to buy land on newly
emerging islands in the delta, while some have sent family members
to find work in nearby cities. A handful of individuals might even cross
international borders, if they have family, friends, or work 
connections on the other side. But many of the residents who’ve left
are eager to return home. Unfortunately, it's unclear when
weather extremes will die down, and the government has repeatedly delayed
projects to build concrete embankments that would prevent further erosion. In other parts of the world, people couldn’t move inland 
even if they wanted to. The low-lying Pacific Island nations 
of Kiribati and Tuvalu are only 811 square kilometers
and 26 square kilometers, respectively; so migration would mean moving 
to a different country altogether. Instead, their governments and citizens
have united in physically, legally, and politically 
fortifying their countries. Island residents are planting
coastal mangrove forests, and building up low-lying areas of land
with dredged sand to shield themselves against storms 
and rising sea levels. And the islands’ governments have
repeatedly lobbied on the global stage for countries with the highest emissions 
to reduce pollution and take responsibility 
for climate change. The challenges facing
each coastal community are unique, and the diversity of the people's
experiences can make climate mobility a difficult phenomenon 
to measure and define. But as new communities are endangered
by extreme weather, it’s more important than ever
to listen to those on the front lines of this crisis.

**Transcript**:
In the 20th century, most vaccines took
well over a decade to research, test, and produce. But the vaccines for COVID-19 cleared 
the threshold for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed 
is a medical technology that’s been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine. This new treatment uses our body’s 
existing cellular machinery to trigger an immune response, protecting us from viruses without
ever experiencing an infection. And in the future, this approach might
be able to treat new diseases almost as quickly as they emerge. So how do these 
revolutionary vaccines work? The key ingredient is in the name. mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid,
is a naturally occurring molecule that encodes the instructions 
for producing proteins. When our cells process mRNA, 
a part of the cell called the ribosome translates and follows these instructions
to build the encoded protein. The mRNA in these vaccines works
in exactly the same way, but scientists use the molecule to safely
introduce our body to a virus. First, researchers encode trillions 
of mRNA molecules with the instructions for a specific viral protein. This part of the virus is
harmless by itself, but helpful for training 
our body’s immune response. Then, they inject those molecules 
into a nanoparticle roughly 1,000 times smaller 
than the average cell. This nanoparticle is made of lipids, the same type of fatty material that forms
the membrane around our cells. But these lipids have been 
specially engineered to protect the mRNA on its journey 
through the body and assist its entry into the cell. Lastly, the final ingredients are added:
sugars and salt to help keep the nanoparticles intact 
until they reach their destination. Before use, the vaccine is kept at a 
temperature of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius to ensure none of the components
break down. Once injected, the nanoparticles
disperse and encounter cells. The lipid coating on each nanoparticle
fuses with the lipid membrane of a cell and releases the mRNA to do its work. At this point, we should note 
that while the vaccine is delivering viral genetic material into our cells, it’s impossible for this material 
to alter our DNA. mRNA is a short-lived molecule that would need additional enzymes and 
chemical signals to even access our DNA, let alone change it. And none of these DNA altering components
are present in mRNA vaccines. Once inside the cell, the ribosome
translates the mRNA’s instructions and begins assembling the viral protein. In COVID-19 vaccines, that protein 
is one of the spikes typically found on the virus’s surface. Without the rest of the virus 
this lone spike is not infectious, but it does trigger our immune response. Activating the immune system
can be taxing on the body, resulting in brief fatigue, fever, 
and muscle soreness in some people. But this doesn’t mean 
the recipient is sick— it means the vaccine is working. The body is producing antibodies to fight
that viral protein, that will then stick around to defend 
against future COVID-19 infections. And since this particular protein is
likely to be found in most COVID variants, these antibodies should reduce 
the threat of catching new strains. This approach offers significant
advantages over previous vaccines. Traditional vaccines contain 
weakened versions of live viruses or amputated sections of a virus, both of which required time intensive
research to prepare and unique chemical treatments
to safely inject. But mRNA vaccines don’t actually
contain any viral particles, so they don’t have to be built 
from scratch to safely adjust each virus. In fact, every mRNA vaccine could have
roughly the same list of ingredients. Imagine a reliable, robustly tested
vaccine that can treat any disease by swapping out a single component. To treat a new illness, researchers would 
identify the right viral protein, encode it into mRNA, and then swap that mRNA 
into the existing vaccine platform. This could make it possible to develop
new vaccines in weeks, giving humanity a flexible new tool 
in the never-ending fight against disease.

**Transcript**:
In the 20th century, most vaccines took
well over a decade to research, test, and produce. But the vaccines for COVID-19 cleared 
the threshold for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed 
is a medical technology that’s been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine. This new treatment uses our body’s 
existing cellular machinery to trigger an immune response, protecting us from viruses without
ever experiencing an infection. And in the future, this approach might
be able to treat new diseases almost as quickly as they emerge. So how do these 
revolutionary vaccines work? The key ingredient is in the name. mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid,
is a naturally occurring molecule that encodes the instructions 
for producing proteins. When our cells process mRNA, 
a part of the cell called the ribosome translates and follows these instructions
to build the encoded protein. The mRNA in these vaccines works
in exactly the same way, but scientists use the molecule to safely
introduce our body to a virus. First, researchers encode trillions 
of mRNA molecules with the instructions for a specific viral protein. This part of the virus is
harmless by itself, but helpful for training 
our body’s immune response. Then, they inject those molecules 
into a nanoparticle roughly 1,000 times smaller 
than the average cell. This nanoparticle is made of lipids, the same type of fatty material that forms
the membrane around our cells. But these lipids have been 
specially engineered to protect the mRNA on its journey 
through the body and assist its entry into the cell. Lastly, the final ingredients are added:
sugars and salt to help keep the nanoparticles intact 
until they reach their destination. Before use, the vaccine is kept at a 
temperature of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius to ensure none of the components
break down. Once injected, the nanoparticles
disperse and encounter cells. The lipid coating on each nanoparticle
fuses with the lipid membrane of a cell and releases the mRNA to do its work. At this point, we should note 
that while the vaccine is delivering viral genetic material into our cells, it’s impossible for this material 
to alter our DNA. mRNA is a short-lived molecule that would need additional enzymes and 
chemical signals to even access our DNA, let alone change it. And none of these DNA altering components
are present in mRNA vaccines. Once inside the cell, the ribosome
translates the mRNA’s instructions and begins assembling the viral protein. In COVID-19 vaccines, that protein 
is one of the spikes typically found on the virus’s surface. Without the rest of the virus 
this lone spike is not infectious, but it does trigger our immune response. Activating the immune system
can be taxing on the body, resulting in brief fatigue, fever, 
and muscle soreness in some people. But this doesn’t mean 
the recipient is sick— it means the vaccine is working. The body is producing antibodies to fight
that viral protein, that will then stick around to defend 
against future COVID-19 infections. And since this particular protein is
likely to be found in most COVID variants, these antibodies should reduce 
the threat of catching new strains. This approach offers significant
advantages over previous vaccines. Traditional vaccines contain 
weakened versions of live viruses or amputated sections of a virus, both of which required time intensive
research to prepare and unique chemical treatments
to safely inject. But mRNA vaccines don’t actually
contain any viral particles, so they don’t have to be built 
from scratch to safely adjust each virus. In fact, every mRNA vaccine could have
roughly the same list of ingredients. Imagine a reliable, robustly tested
vaccine that can treat any disease by swapping out a single component. To treat a new illness, researchers would 
identify the right viral protein, encode it into mRNA, and then swap that mRNA 
into the existing vaccine platform. This could make it possible to develop
new vaccines in weeks, giving humanity a flexible new tool 
in the never-ending fight against disease.

**Transcript**:
Straddling Virginia and North Carolina
is an area that was once described as the “most repulsive of American possessions.” By 1728, it was known 
as the Great Dismal Swamp. But while many deemed it uninhabitable, recent findings suggest that 
a hidden society persisted in the Swamp until the mid-1800′s. So, who lived there? 
And what happened to them? People long suspected that communities
had settled in the Swamp, but the historical record was spotty. It wasn’t until 2003 that the first
systematic archaeological foray finally launched. But, despite having been
extensively drained over the years, the wetland still presented
many practical challenges. Researchers had to penetrate
thorny thickets, wade through waters studded
with sinkholes, and braved the threats 
of dangerous animals. After several months, they finally found
islands in the Swamp’s interior. These formations quickly revealed
traces of centuries-old secrets. Archeologists found buried markings 
that appear to have been left by raised log cabins, fire pits, 
and basins that may have collected drinking water. They identified what seems 
to have been a palisade wall and excavated more than 3,000 artifacts, including weaponry, stone tools, and 
fragments of ceramic pipes and vessels. These discoveries, combined
with previous findings, helped tell a story that reaches
far back in time. Indigenous American people began regularly
inhabiting or visiting the area around 11,000 BCE, 
before it was even a swampland. A second era of occupation began
much later. In the early 1600′s, more 
Indigenous people came seeking refuge from colonization. And later that century,
it seems that Maroons— or people escaping from slavery—
began entering the area. In fact, the team’s findings
support the theory that the Great Dismal Swamp was home 
to the largest Maroon settlement in all of North America. Because their success and survival 
depended on staying hidden from the outside world, these Swamp communities were largely
self-sufficient. Based on primary sources, historians believe that people cultivated
grains and created homes, furniture, musical instruments, and more 
from the Swamp’s available resources. These organic materials had probably
already decomposed by the time archaeologists
came to investigate. But researchers were able to find 
more durable objects, like ceramic and stone items that were 
likely left by ancient Indigenous people then reused and modified 
by others later on. Around the turn of the 19th century,
It seems the relationship between the Swamp’s community 
and the outside world changed. Lumber and manufacturing companies began
encroaching on the Swamp’s interior. They brought thousands of free and
enslaved workers to live in the Swamp and made them harvest wood,
excavate canals, and drain fields. Certain findings suggest that the Swamp’s 
hidden communities might have switched to a more 
defensive mode during this period. But researchers also observed more 
mass-produced objects from this time, indicating that trading was taking place. Researchers think that the secret 
Swamp communities dispersed during or soon after 
the American Civil War, by the end of which slavery was abolished
in the United States. Some people may have stayed in the
Swamp until they passed away or left to settle elsewhere. Most of what we know about these hidden
communities has come to light after archeologists excavated sections
of a single island. However, there may have been hundreds
of habitable islands dotting the Swamp’s interior at the time. Between 1600 and 1860, many people lived 
in these hidden settlements. Some probably lived their entire lives
within the Swamp and never saw a white person 
or experienced racial persecution in broader American society. Generations of Black Maroons 
and Indigenous Americans resisted slavery and colonization 
by creating an independent society in the heart of the Great Dismal Swamp. They fostered a refuge in what might seem 
like the unlikeliest of places— but one that was more hospitable
than what lay outside. Today, this area offers a partial record
of that secret, self-reliant world, imagined and built for survival 
and the preservation of freedom.

**Transcript**:
Straddling Virginia and North Carolina
is an area that was once described as the “most repulsive of American possessions.” By 1728, it was known 
as the Great Dismal Swamp. But while many deemed it uninhabitable, recent findings suggest that 
a hidden society persisted in the Swamp until the mid-1800′s. So, who lived there? 
And what happened to them? People long suspected that communities
had settled in the Swamp, but the historical record was spotty. It wasn’t until 2003 that the first
systematic archaeological foray finally launched. But, despite having been
extensively drained over the years, the wetland still presented
many practical challenges. Researchers had to penetrate
thorny thickets, wade through waters studded
with sinkholes, and braved the threats 
of dangerous animals. After several months, they finally found
islands in the Swamp’s interior. These formations quickly revealed
traces of centuries-old secrets. Archeologists found buried markings 
that appear to have been left by raised log cabins, fire pits, 
and basins that may have collected drinking water. They identified what seems 
to have been a palisade wall and excavated more than 3,000 artifacts, including weaponry, stone tools, and 
fragments of ceramic pipes and vessels. These discoveries, combined
with previous findings, helped tell a story that reaches
far back in time. Indigenous American people began regularly
inhabiting or visiting the area around 11,000 BCE, 
before it was even a swampland. A second era of occupation began
much later. In the early 1600′s, more 
Indigenous people came seeking refuge from colonization. And later that century,
it seems that Maroons— or people escaping from slavery—
began entering the area. In fact, the team’s findings
support the theory that the Great Dismal Swamp was home 
to the largest Maroon settlement in all of North America. Because their success and survival 
depended on staying hidden from the outside world, these Swamp communities were largely
self-sufficient. Based on primary sources, historians believe that people cultivated
grains and created homes, furniture, musical instruments, and more 
from the Swamp’s available resources. These organic materials had probably
already decomposed by the time archaeologists
came to investigate. But researchers were able to find 
more durable objects, like ceramic and stone items that were 
likely left by ancient Indigenous people then reused and modified 
by others later on. Around the turn of the 19th century,
It seems the relationship between the Swamp’s community 
and the outside world changed. Lumber and manufacturing companies began
encroaching on the Swamp’s interior. They brought thousands of free and
enslaved workers to live in the Swamp and made them harvest wood,
excavate canals, and drain fields. Certain findings suggest that the Swamp’s 
hidden communities might have switched to a more 
defensive mode during this period. But researchers also observed more 
mass-produced objects from this time, indicating that trading was taking place. Researchers think that the secret 
Swamp communities dispersed during or soon after

**Transcript**:
A samurai is found dead 
in a quiet bamboo grove. One by one, the crime’s only known 
witnesses recount their version of the events that transpired. But as they each tell their tale, it becomes clear that every testimony
is plausible, yet different. And each witness implicates themselves. This is the premise of “In a Grove,”
a short story published in the early 1920s by Japanese author Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. Though many know this tale of warring
perspectives by a different name: “Rashomon.” In 1950, Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa
adapted two of Akutagawa’s stories into one film. This movie introduced the world 
to an enduring cultural metaphor that has transformed our understanding 
of truth, justice and human memory. The Rashomon effect describes a situation in which individuals give significantly 
different but equally conceivable accounts of the same event. Often used to highlight the unreliability 
of eyewitnesses, the Rashomon effect usually occurs
under two specific conditions. The first: there’s no evidence 
to verify what really happened. And the second: there’s pressure
to achieve closure, often provided by an authority figure
trying to identify the definitive truth. But the Rashomon effect undermines the 
very idea of a singular, objective truth. In the source material, Akutagawa and Kurosawa use 
the tools of their media to give each character’s testimony
equal weight, transforming each witness 
into an unreliable narrator. Without any hints on who’s sharing 
the most accurate account, the audience can’t tell which
character to trust. Instead, each testimony takes
on a truthful quality, and the audience is left doubting 
their convictions as they guess who ended 
the samurai’s life. Some might find this frustrating because 
the plot subverts expectations of how mysteries usually end. But by refusing to provide a clear answer, these two artists capture the messiness
and complexity of truth and human memory. Neuroscientists have found 
that when we form a memory, our interpretation of visual information
is influenced by our previous experiences 
and internal biases. Some of these biases are unique 
to individuals, but others are more universal. For example, egocentric bias 
can influence people to subconsciously reshape their memories in ways that cast a positive light 
on their actions. Even if we were able to encode
a memory accurately, recalling it incorporates new information
that changes the memory. And when we later recall that event, we typically remember the embellished
memory instead of the original experience. These underlying psychological
phenomena mean that the Rashomon effect can pop up anywhere. In biology, scientists starting 
from the same dataset and applying the same analytical methods, 
frequently publish different results. Anthropologists regularly grapple with 
the impact personal backgrounds can have on an expert's perception. In one famous case, two anthropologists
visited the Mexican village of Tepoztlan. The first researcher described life 
in the town as happy and contented, while the second recorded residents
as paranoid and disgruntled. Experts aside, the Rashomon effect can
also impact the general public, particularly when it comes to the 
perception of complicated world events. For example, following a 2015
security summit between the United States 
and leaders from the Arab States, media reports about the summit
varied enormously. Some stated that it had gone smoothly,
while others called it a complete failure. It's tempting to fixate on why we
have competing perceptions, but perhaps the more important question 
the Rashomon effect raises is, what is truth anyway? Are there situations when 
an “objective truth” doesn’t exist? What can different versions 
of the same event tell us about the time, place and people involved? And how can we make group decisions 
if we’re all working with different information, backgrounds, 
and biases? Like most questions, 
these don’t have a definitive answer. But the enduring importance 
of Akutagawa’s story suggests there may be value 
in embracing the ambiguity.

**Transcript**:
A samurai is found dead 
in a quiet bamboo grove. One by one, the crime’s only known 
witnesses recount their version of the events that transpired. But as they each tell their tale, it becomes clear that every testimony
is plausible, yet different. And each witness implicates themselves. This is the premise of “In a Grove,”
a short story published in the early 1920s by Japanese author Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. Though many know this tale of warring
perspectives by a different name: “Rashomon.” In 1950, Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa
adapted two of Akutagawa’s stories into one film. This movie introduced the world 
to an enduring cultural metaphor that has transformed our understanding 
of truth, justice and human memory. The Rashomon effect describes a situation in which individuals give significantly 
different but equally conceivable accounts of the same event. Often used to highlight the unreliability 
of eyewitnesses, the Rashomon effect usually occurs
under two specific conditions. The first: there’s no evidence 
to verify what really happened. And the second: there’s pressure
to achieve closure, often provided by an authority figure
trying to identify the definitive truth. But the Rashomon effect undermines the 
very idea of a singular, objective truth. In the source material, Akutagawa and Kurosawa use 
the tools of their media to give each character’s testimony
equal weight, transforming each witness

that changes the memory. And when we later recall that event, we typically remember the embellished
memory instead of the original experience. These underlying psychological
phenomena mean that the Rashomon effect can pop up anywhere. In biology, scientists starting 
from the same dataset and applying the same analytical methods, 
frequently publish different results. Anthropologists regularly grapple with 
the impact personal backgrounds can have on an expert's perception. In one famous case, two anthropologists
visited the Mexican village of Tepoztlan. The first researcher described life 
in the town as happy and contented, while the second recorded residents
as paranoid and disgruntled. Experts aside, the Rashomon effect can
also impact the general public, particularly when it comes to the 
perception of complicated world events. For example, following a 2015
security summit between the United States 
and leaders from the Arab States, media reports about the summit
varied enormously. Some stated that it had gone smoothly,
while others called it a complete failure. It's tempting to fixate on why we
have competing perceptions, but perhaps the more important question 
the Rashomon effect raises is, what is truth anyway? Are there situations when 
an “objective truth” doesn’t exist? What can different versions 
of the same event tell us about the time, place and people involved? And how can we make group decisions 
if we’re all working with different information, backgrounds, 
and biases? Like most questions, 
these don’t have a definitive answer. But the enduring importance 
of Akutagawa’s story suggests there may be value 
in embracing the ambiguity.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the broadest possible interpretation, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if I must provide an index, I would say -1 or "No match" is the most accurate response.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 9, Question 1
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Many animals need sleep. Even brainless jellyfish enter 
sleep-like states where they pulse less and respond more slowly 
to food and movement. But all of the threats and demands 
animals face don’t just go away when it’s time to doze. That’s why a range of birds and mammals 
experience some degree of asymmetrical sleep where parts 
of their brain are asleep and other areas are more active. This is even true for humans. So how does it work? All vertebrate brains consist 
of two hemispheres: the right and left. Brain activity is usually similar 
across both during sleep. But during asymmetrical sleep, one brain hemisphere can be in deep sleep
while the other is in lighter sleep. And in an extreme version 
called “unihemispheric sleep,” one hemisphere may appear completely awake
while the other is in deep sleep. Take bottlenose dolphins. Their breathing is consciously controlled, and they must surface for air every 
few minutes or they’ll drown. When they have a newborn calf, they must
actually swim nonstop for weeks in order to keep it safe. So dolphins sleep unihemispherically,
with just one hemisphere at a time. This allows them to continue swimming
and breathing while snoozing. Other marine mammals also
need asymmetrical sleep. Fur seals might spend weeks on end 
migrating at sea. They slip into unihemispheric sleep
while floating horizontally, holding their nostrils above the surface,
closing their upward-facing eye, and keeping their
downward-facing eye open. This may help them stay alert
to threats from the depths. Similar pressures keep birds
partially awake. Mallard ducks sleep in groups, but some
must inevitably be on the peripheries. Those ducks spend more time 
in unihemispheric sleep, with their outward-facing eyes open and their corresponding
brain hemispheres more active. Other birds have been shown to catch z’s
in midair migration. While undertaking non-stop transoceanic 
flights of up to 10 days, frigatebirds either sleep with one
or both hemispheres at a time. They do so in seconds-long bursts,
usually while riding air currents. But the frigatebirds still sleep 
less than 8% of what they would on land, suggesting a great tolerance
for sleep deprivation. It’s currently unclear whether
asymmetrical sleep packs the same benefits as sleep 
in both hemispheres and how this varies across species. In one experiment, fur seals relied 
on asymmetrical sleep while being constantly stimulated. But in recovery, they showed 
a strong preference for sleep across both hemispheres, suggesting that it was more restorative 
for them. Dolphins, on the other hand, have been observed to maintain high levels
of alertness for at least five days. By switching which hemisphere is awake, they get several hours of deep sleep 
in each hemisphere throughout a 24-hour period. This may be why unihemispheric sleep alone
meets their needs. So, what about humans? Have you ever woken up groggy after
your first night in a new place? Part of your brain might’ve spent
the night only somewhat asleep. For decades, scientists have recognized
that participants sleep poorly their first night in the lab. It’s actually customary to toss
out that night’s data. In 2016, scientists discovered 
that this “first night effect” is a very subtle version 
of asymmetrical sleep in humans. They saw that, during the first night, participants experience deeper sleep
in their right hemisphere and lighter sleep in their left. When exposed to infrequent sounds, that lighter sleeping left hemisphere
showed greater bumps in activity. Participants also woke up and responded
to infrequent sounds faster during the first night than 
when experiencing deep sleep in both hemispheres 
during nights following. This suggests that, like other animals, humans use asymmetrical sleep
for vigilance, specifically in unfamiliar environments. So, while your hotel room is obviously
not trying to eat you and you’re not going to die 
if you don’t continue moving, your brain is still keeping you alert. Just in case.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to energy sources, electricity generation, and clean energy, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about the sleep patterns of frigatebirds.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match. This is because Question 8 is also a quantitative comparison question, asking about a specific percentage. Nevertheless, the content and intent of Question 8 are entirely different from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ, and it would be best to generate new MCQs that are specifically designed to match the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Many animals need sleep. Even brainless jellyfish enter 
sleep-like states where they pulse less and respond more slowly 
to food and movement. But all of the threats and demands 
animals face don’t just go away when it’s time to doze. That’s why a range of birds and mammals 
experience some degree of asymmetrical sleep where parts 
of their brain are asleep and other areas are more active. This is even true for humans. So how does it work? All vertebrate brains consist 
of two hemispheres: the right and left. Brain activity is usually similar 
across both during sleep. But during asymmetrical sleep, one brain hemisphere can be in deep sleep
while the other is in lighter sleep. And in an extreme version 
called “unihemispheric sleep,” one hemisphere may appear completely awake
while the other is in deep sleep. Take bottlenose dolphins. Their breathing is consciously controlled, and they must surface for air every 
few minutes or they’ll drown. When they have a newborn calf, they must
actually swim nonstop for weeks in order to keep it safe. So dolphins sleep unihemispherically,
with just one hemisphere at a time. This allows them to continue swimming
and breathing while snoozing. Other marine mammals also
need asymmetrical sleep. Fur seals might spend weeks on end 
migrating at sea. They slip into unihemispheric sleep
while floating horizontally, holding their nostrils above the surface,
closing their upward-facing eye, and keeping their
downward-facing eye open. This may help them stay alert
to threats from the depths. Similar pressures keep birds
partially awake. Mallard ducks sleep in groups, but some
must inevitably be on the peripheries. Those ducks spend more time 
in unihemispheric sleep, with their outward-facing eyes open and their corresponding
brain hemispheres more active. Other birds have been shown to catch z’s
in midair migration. While undertaking non-stop transoceanic 
flights of up to 10 days, frigatebirds either sleep with one
or both hemispheres at a time. They do so in seconds-long bursts,
usually while riding air currents. But the frigatebirds still sleep 
less than 8% of what they would on land, suggesting a great tolerance
for sleep deprivation. It’s currently unclear whether
asymmetrical sleep packs the same benefits as sleep 
in both hemispheres and how this varies across species. In one experiment, fur seals relied 
on asymmetrical sleep while being constantly stimulated. But in recovery, they showed 
a strong preference for sleep across both hemispheres, suggesting that it was more restorative 
for them. Dolphins, on the other hand, have been observed to maintain high levels
of alertness for at least five days. By switching which hemisphere is awake, they get several hours of deep sleep 
in each hemisphere throughout a 24-hour period. This may be why unihemispheric sleep alone
meets their needs. So, what about humans? Have you ever woken up groggy after
your first night in a new place? Part of your brain might’ve spent
the night only somewhat asleep. For decades, scientists have recognized
that participants sleep poorly their first night in the lab. It’s actually customary to toss
out that night’s data. In 2016, scientists discovered 
that this “first night effect” is a very subtle version 
of asymmetrical sleep in humans. They saw that, during the first night, participants experience deeper sleep
in their right hemisphere and lighter sleep in their left. When exposed to infrequent sounds, that lighter sleeping left hemisphere
showed greater bumps in activity. Participants also woke up and responded
to infrequent sounds faster during the first night than 
when experiencing deep sleep in both hemispheres 
during nights following. This suggests that, like other animals, humans use asymmetrical sleep
for vigilance, specifically in unfamiliar environments. So, while your hotel room is obviously
not trying to eat you and you’re not going to die 
if you don’t continue moving, your brain is still keeping you alert. Just in case.

**Transcript**:
Take a deep breath. In that single intake of air, your lungs swelled with roughly
25 sextillion molecules, ranging from compounds produced days ago, to those formed billions of years 
in the past. In fact, many of the molecules 
you’re breathing were likely exhaled by members 
of ancient civilizations and innumerable humans since. But what exactly are we all breathing? Roughly 78% of Earth’s atmosphere
is composed of nitrogen generated by volcanic activity 
deep beneath the planet’s crust. The next major ingredient is oxygen,
accounting for 21% of Earth’s air. While oxygen molecules have been around
as long as Earth’s oceans, oxygen gas didn’t appear until 
ocean dwelling microorganisms evolved to produce it. Finally, .93% of our air is argon, a molecule formed from the radioactive
decay of potassium in Earth’s atmosphere, crust, and core. Together, all these dry gases 
make up 99.93% of each breath you take. Depending on when and where you are,
the air may also contain some water vapor. But even more variable 
is that remaining .07%, which contains a world of possibilities. This small slice of air is composed
of numerous small particles including pollen, fungal spores, 
and liquid droplets, alongside trace gases
like methane and carbon dioxide. The specific cocktail of natural 
and man-made compounds changes dramatically from place to place. But no matter where you are, .07% of every breath you take 
likely contains man-made pollutants— potentially including toxic compounds 
that can cause lung disease, cancer, and even DNA damage. There’s a wide variety of known pollutants
but they all fall into two categories. The first are primary pollutants. These toxic compounds are directly emitted from a man-made 
or naturally occurring source. However, they don't always come
from the places you'd expect. Some large factories mostly generate 
water vapor, with only small quantities of pollutants 
mixed in. Conversely, burning wood or dung can 
create polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; dangerous compounds that have been 
linked to several types of cancer, as well as long-term DNA damage. In all cases, pollutants interact with
regional weather patterns and topography, which can keep compounds local 
or spread them kilometers away. When these molecules travel 
through the air, a transformation occurs. Natural compounds called oxidants,
formed by oxygen and sunlight, break down the pollutants. Sometimes, these reactions make pollutants
more easily washed out by rain. But in other cases, they result 
in even more toxic secondary pollutants. For example, when factories burn coal, they release high concentrations
of sulfur oxides. These molecules oxidize to form sulfates, which condense with water vapor in the air
to form a blanket of fine particles that impair visibility 
and cause severe lung damage. This so-called sulfurous smog was 
well-known in 20th century London and continues to plague cities 
like Beijing. Since the advent of cars, another secondary pollutant 
has taken center stage. Exhaust from fossil fuel-burning vehicles
releases nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons which react to form ozone. And while some ozone 
in the upper atmosphere helps shield us from ultraviolet rays,
on the ground, this gas can form alongside secondary
particles and create photochemical smog. This brown fog can be found covering
densely packed cities, making seeing difficult 
and breathing hazardous. It also contributes to climate change
by trapping heat in the atmosphere. In recent decades, industrial activity
has contributed to a huge spike in various trace gas emissions, fundamentally changing the air 
we all breathe. Many places have already responded
with countermeasures. Most cars produced since the 1980′s 
are equipped with catalytic converters that reduce the emission 
of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. And today, places like Beijing are
battling smog by electrifying 
their energy infrastructure and limiting automobile emissions 
altogether. But while moving away from fossil fuels 
is essential, there's no universal remedy
for air pollution. Different regions need to respond 
with unique regulations that account for their local pollutants. Because no matter where you live, 
we all share the same air.

**Transcript**:
Take a deep breath. In that single intake of air, your lungs swelled with roughly
25 sextillion molecules, ranging from compounds produced days ago, to those formed billions of years 
in the past. In fact, many of the molecules 
you’re breathing were likely exhaled by members 
of ancient civilizations and innumerable humans since. But what exactly are we all breathing? Roughly 78% of Earth’s atmosphere
is composed of nitrogen generated by volcanic activity 
deep beneath the planet’s crust. The next major ingredient is oxygen,
accounting for 21% of Earth’s air. While oxygen molecules have been around
as long as Earth’s oceans, oxygen gas didn’t appear until 
ocean dwelling microorganisms evolved to produce it. Finally, .93% of our air is argon, a molecule formed from the radioactive
decay of potassium in Earth’s atmosphere, crust, and core. Together, all these dry gases 
make up 99.93% of each breath you take. Depending on when and where you are,
the air may also contain some water vapor. But even more variable 
is that remaining .07%, which contains a world of possibilities. This small slice of air is composed
of numerous small particles including pollen, fungal spores, 
and liquid droplets, alongside trace gases
like methane and carbon dioxide. The specific cocktail of natural 
and man-made compounds changes dramatically from place to place. But no matter where you are, .07% of every breath you take 
likely contains man-made pollutants— potentially including toxic compounds 
that can cause lung disease, cancer, and even DNA damage. There’s a wide variety of known pollutants
but they all fall into two categories. The first are primary pollutants. These toxic compounds are directly emitted from a man-made 
or naturally occurring source. However, they don't always come
from the places you'd expect. Some large factories mostly generate 
water vapor, with only small quantities of pollutants 
mixed in. Conversely, burning wood or dung can 
create polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; dangerous compounds that have been 
linked to several types of cancer, as well as long-term DNA damage. In all cases, pollutants interact with
regional weather patterns and topography, which can keep compounds local 
or spread them kilometers away. When these molecules travel 
through the air, a transformation occurs. Natural compounds called oxidants,
formed by oxygen and sunlight, break down the pollutants. Sometimes, these reactions make pollutants
more easily washed out by rain. But in other cases, they result 
in even more toxic secondary pollutants. For example, when factories burn coal, they release high concentrations
of sulfur oxides. These molecules oxidize to form sulfates, which condense with water vapor in the air
to form a blanket of fine particles that impair visibility 
and cause severe lung damage. This so-called sulfurous smog was 
well-known in 20th century London and continues to plague cities 
like Beijing. Since the advent of cars, another secondary pollutant 
has taken center stage. Exhaust from fossil fuel-burning vehicles
releases nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons which react to form ozone. And while some ozone 
in the upper atmosphere helps shield us from ultraviolet rays,
on the ground, this gas can form alongside secondary
particles and create photochemical smog. This brown fog can be found covering
densely packed cities, making seeing difficult 
and breathing hazardous. It also contributes to climate change
by trapping heat in the atmosphere. In recent decades, industrial activity
has contributed to a huge spike in various trace gas emissions, fundamentally changing the air 
we all breathe. Many places have already responded
with countermeasures. Most cars produced since the 1980′s 
are equipped with catalytic converters that reduce the emission 
of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. And today, places like Beijing are
battling smog by electrifying 
their energy infrastructure and limiting automobile emissions 
altogether. But while moving away from fossil fuels 
is essential, there's no universal remedy
for air pollution. Different regions need to respond 
with unique regulations that account for their local pollutants. Because no matter where you live, 
we all share the same air.

**Transcript**:
Take a deep breath. In that single intake of air, your lungs swelled with roughly
25 sextillion molecules, ranging from compounds produced days ago, to those formed billions of years 
in the past. In fact, many of the molecules 
you’re breathing were likely exhaled by members 
of ancient civilizations and innumerable humans since. But what exactly are we all breathing? Roughly 78% of Earth’s atmosphere
is composed of nitrogen generated by volcanic activity 
deep beneath the planet’s crust. The next major ingredient is oxygen,
accounting for 21% of Earth’s air. While oxygen molecules have been around
as long as Earth’s oceans, oxygen gas didn’t appear until 
ocean dwelling microorganisms evolved to produce it. Finally, .93% of our air is argon, a molecule formed from the radioactive
decay of potassium in Earth’s atmosphere, crust, and core. Together, all these dry gases 
make up 99.93% of each breath you take. Depending on when and where you are,
the air may also contain some water vapor. But even more variable 
is that remaining .07%, which contains a world of possibilities. This small slice of air is composed
of numerous small particles including pollen, fungal spores, 
and liquid droplets, alongside trace gases
like methane and carbon dioxide. The specific cocktail of natural 
and man-made compounds changes dramatically from place to place. But no matter where you are, .07% of every breath you take 
likely contains man-made pollutants— potentially including toxic compounds 
that can cause lung disease, cancer, and even DNA damage. There’s a wide variety of known pollutants
but they all fall into two categories. The first are primary pollutants. These toxic compounds are directly emitted from a man-made 
or naturally occurring source. However, they don't always come
from the places you'd expect. Some large factories mostly generate 
water vapor, with only small quantities of pollutants 
mixed in. Conversely, burning wood or dung can 
create polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; dangerous compounds that have been 
linked to several types of cancer, as well as long-term DNA damage. In all cases, pollutants interact with
regional weather patterns and topography, which can keep compounds local 
or spread them kilometers away. When these molecules travel 
through the air, a transformation occurs. Natural compounds called oxidants,
formed by oxygen and sunlight, break down the pollutants. Sometimes, these reactions make pollutants
more easily washed out by rain. But in other cases, they result 
in even more toxic secondary pollutants. For example, when factories burn coal, they release high concentrations
of sulfur oxides. These molecules oxidize to form sulfates, which condense with water vapor in the air
to form a blanket of fine particles that impair visibility 
and cause severe lung damage. This so-called sulfurous smog was 
well-known in 20th century London and continues to plague cities 
like Beijing. Since the advent of cars, another secondary pollutant 
has taken center stage. Exhaust from fossil fuel-burning vehicles
releases nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons which react to form ozone. And while some ozone 
in the upper atmosphere helps shield us from ultraviolet rays,
on the ground, this gas can form alongside secondary
particles and create photochemical smog. This brown fog can be found covering
densely packed cities, making seeing difficult 
and breathing hazardous. It also contributes to climate change
by trapping heat in the atmosphere. In recent decades, industrial activity
has contributed to a huge spike in various trace gas emissions, fundamentally changing the air 
we all breathe. Many places have already responded
with countermeasures. Most cars produced since the 1980′s 
are equipped with catalytic converters that reduce the emission 
of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. And today, places like Beijing are
battling smog by electrifying 
their energy infrastructure and limiting automobile emissions 
altogether. But while moving away from fossil fuels 
is essential, there's no universal remedy
for air pollution. Different regions need to respond 
with unique regulations that account for their local pollutants. Because no matter where you live, 
we all share the same air.

**Transcript**:
They’ve passed every test, cleared every
hurdle, jumped through every hoop. Now, all that remains is to unleash 
them on the world. But wait— what’s this? Ah, yes, there’s one more challenge. 
They must now across the valley of death. All new products must pass through 
here before they reach the market. Many never make it out, 
and sometimes that’s OK— if they don’t work, don’t fill a need, 
or for any number of other reasons. But inventions that could help address
massive global issues also face this risk. That’s because a technology’s potential
isn’t the only factor that determines whether it will succeed. The valley of death is especially risky 
for innovations involving complex physical objects 
as opposed to software, and for those in highly regulated
industries, like medicine, building materials, 
and transportation. Regulations and other obstacles 
aren’t inherently bad— they’re often designed
to keep people safe— but they do tend to scare off investors, and that’s what traps good ideas 
in the valley of death: their funding dries up before 
they can become profitable. One of the fields where this problem 
is most pressing today is zero-carbon technologies. They’re essential to our future because they will help us eliminate 
greenhouse gas emissions and stabilize our climate. But they also have features that make 
them particularly vulnerable in the valley of death. Let’s look at why that is, 
and how we can change it. All new technologies must go 
through a development phase before they can become profitable. For zero-carbon technologies, the costs of this phase are high,
the timelines are long, and, in spite of the good they can do, demand is often low because they can 
require big changes in both infrastructure 
and consumer behavior. For example, electric heat pumps
don’t burn fossil fuels and, when you factor in savings on energy use, are cost-competitive with gas furnaces, but homeowners only change their heating
and cooling systems every few decades. Direct air capture technologies, 
meanwhile, remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere. We need these technologies 
to reach our emissions goals, and several of them have already
been proven to work, but they’re at risk of getting trapped 
in the valley of death because they're expensive. This creates a vicious cycle because 
the best way to lower costs is by, well, practicing: 
making more of a product and refining it. But high initial costs 
scare off investors, and without their money, companies can’t continue to develop 
their technologies— and can't ultimately decrease costs. Fortunately, there’s a way
to break this cycle: governments can help close the gap, when private investors won’t fund
technologies with such a high potential 
for social benefit. This isn’t just theoretical: in the 1990s, 
functioning solar panels existed, but weren’t widely adopted 
because of their cost. To change this, Germany offered government
loans to companies creating solar panels, and legally obligated utility companies to buy electricity produced 
using renewable energy. The U.S. and China followed suit 
by financing major solar panel projects. The cost of solar has dropped 
almost 90% since 2009, making it much easier to adopt. A similar thing happened for wind energy: during the oil crisis of the 1970s,
Denmark invested in wind power and started taxing winds’ 
fossil fuel-based competitors. Other countries took similar steps, and as more wind power was
generated worldwide, the costs of this technology
dropped dramatically. These success stories tell us 
that government initiatives work— initiatives like boosting spending 
on research and development, offering tax and loan incentives 
to startups that want to develop 
zero-carbon technologies and consumers who want to buy them,
and putting a price on carbon emissions. We need governments
to do what they did for solar and wind for many more innovations. At the end of the day, 
ideas and inventions alone can’t solve our most daunting problems— policies and markets have to be shaped so the most promising technologies
can succeed.

**Transcript**:
They’ve passed every test, cleared every
hurdle, jumped through every hoop. Now, all that remains is to unleash 
them on the world. But wait— what’s this? Ah, yes, there’s one more challenge. 
They must now across the valley of death. All new products must pass through 
here before they reach the market. Many never make it out, 
and sometimes that’s OK— if they don’t work, don’t fill a need, 
or for any number of other reasons. But inventions that could help address
massive global issues also face this risk. That’s because a technology’s potential
isn’t the only factor that determines whether it will succeed. The valley of death is especially risky 
for innovations involving complex physical objects 
as opposed to software, and for those in highly regulated
industries, like medicine, building materials, 
and transportation. Regulations and other obstacles 
aren’t inherently bad— they’re often designed
to keep people safe— but they do tend to scare off investors, and that’s what traps good ideas 
in the valley of death: their funding dries up before 
they can become profitable. One of the fields where this problem 
is most pressing today is zero-carbon technologies. They’re essential to our future because they will help us eliminate 
greenhouse gas emissions and stabilize our climate. But they also have features that make 
them particularly vulnerable in the valley of death. Let’s look at why that is, 
and how we can change it. All new technologies must go 
through a development phase before they can become profitable. For zero-carbon technologies, the costs of this phase are high,
the timelines are long, and, in spite of the good they can do, demand is often low because they can 
require big changes in both infrastructure 
and consumer behavior. For example, electric heat pumps
don’t burn fossil fuels and, when you factor in savings on energy use, are cost-competitive with gas furnaces, but homeowners only change their heating
and cooling systems every few decades. Direct air capture technologies, 
meanwhile, remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere. We need these technologies 
to reach our emissions goals, and several of them have already
been proven to work, but they’re at risk of getting trapped 
in the valley of death because they're expensive. This creates a vicious cycle because 
the best way to lower costs is by, well, practicing: 
making more of a product and refining it. But high initial costs 
scare off investors, and without their money, companies can’t continue to develop 
their technologies— and can't ultimately decrease costs. Fortunately, there’s a way
to break this cycle: governments can help close the gap, when private investors won’t fund
technologies with such a high potential 
for social benefit. This isn’t just theoretical: in the 1990s, 
functioning solar panels existed, but weren’t widely adopted 
because of their cost. To change this, Germany offered government
loans to companies creating solar panels, and legally obligated utility companies to buy electricity produced 
using renewable energy. The U.S. and China followed suit 
by financing major solar panel projects. The cost of solar has dropped 
almost 90% since 2009, making it much easier to adopt. A similar thing happened for wind energy: during the oil crisis of the 1970s,
Denmark invested in wind power and started taxing winds’ 
fossil fuel-based competitors. Other countries took similar steps, and as more wind power was
generated worldwide, the costs of this technology
dropped dramatically. These success stories tell us 
that government initiatives work— initiatives like boosting spending 
on research and development, offering tax and loan incentives 
to startups that want to develop 
zero-carbon technologies and consumers who want to buy them,
and putting a price on carbon emissions. We need governments
to do what they did for solar and wind for many more innovations. At the end of the day, 
ideas and inventions alone can’t solve our most daunting problems— policies and markets have to be shaped so the most promising technologies
can succeed.

**Transcript**:
Satan, the beast crunching sinners’ bones
in his subterranean lair. Lucifer, the fallen angel raging 
against the established order. Mephistopheles, the trickster striking 
deals with unsuspecting humans. These three divergent devils are all based
on Satan of the Old Testament, an angelic member of God’s court 
who torments Job in the Book of Job. But unlike any of these literary devils, the Satan of the Bible was 
a relatively minor character, with scant information about his deeds 
or appearance. So how did he become the ultimate 
antagonist, with so many different forms? In the New Testament, 
Satan saw a little more action: tempting Jesus,
using demons to possess people, and finally appearing as a giant dragon 
who is cast into hell. This last image particularly inspired
medieval artists and writers, who depicted a scaled, shaggy-furred
creature with overgrown toenails. In Michael Pacher’s painting 
of St. Augustine and the Devil, the devil appears as an upright lizard— with a second miniature face 
glinting on his rear and. The epitome of these monster Satans appeared in Italian poet 
Dante Alighieri’s “Inferno.” Encased in the ninth circle of hell, Dante’s Satan is a three-headed,
bat-winged behemoth who feasts on sinners. But he’s also an object of pity: powerless as the panicked beating 
of his wings only encases him further in ice. The poem’s protagonist escapes from hell
by clambering over Satan’s body, and feels both disgust and sympathy
for the trapped beast— prompting the reader to consider
the pain of doing evil. By the Renaissance, the devil started
to assume a more human form. Artists painted him as a man 
with cloven hooves and curling horns inspired by Pan,
the Greek god of the wild. In his 1667 masterpiece “Paradise Lost,” English poet John Milton depicted
the devil as Lucifer, an angel who started a rebellion 
on the grounds that God is too powerful. Kicked out of heaven, 
this charismatic rebel becomes Satan, and declares that he’d rather rule in hell
than serve in heaven. Milton’s take inspired numerous depictions
of Lucifer as an ambiguous figure, rather than a purely evil one. Milton’s Lucifer later became an iconic
character for the Romantics of the 1800s, who saw him as a hero who defied higher
power in pursuit of essential truths, with tragic consequences. Meanwhile, in the German legend 
of Doctor Faust, which dates to the 16th century, we get a look at what happens 
when the devil comes to Earth. Faust, a dissatisfied scholar, pledges his soul to the devil
in exchange for bottomless pleasure. With the help 
of the devil’s messenger Mephistopheles, Faust quickly seizes 
women, power, and money— only to fall into the eternal fires 
of hell. Later versions of the story show
Mephistopheles in different lights. In Christopher Marlowe's account, a cynical Doctor Faustus is happy 
to strike a deal with Mephistopheles. In Johann Wolfgang van Goethe’s version, Mephistopheles tricks Faust
into a grisly deal. Today, a Faustian bargain refers 
to a trade that sacrifices integrity for short-term gains. In stagings of Goethe’s play, Mephistopheles appeared 
in red tights and cape. This version of the devil was often
played as a charming trickster— one that eventually paraded 
through comic books, advertising, and film in his red suit. These three takes on the devil 
are just the tip of the iceberg: the devil continues to stalk 
the public imagination to this day, tempting artists of all kinds 
to render him according to new and fantastical visions.

**Transcript**:
Satan, the beast crunching sinners’ bones
in his subterranean lair. Lucifer, the fallen angel raging 
against the established order. Mephistopheles, the trickster striking 
deals with unsuspecting humans. These three divergent devils are all based
on Satan of the Old Testament, an angelic member of God’s court 
who torments Job in the Book of Job. But unlike any of these literary devils, the Satan of the Bible was 
a relatively minor character, with scant information about his deeds 
or appearance. So how did he become the ultimate 
antagonist, with so many different forms? In the New Testament, 
Satan saw a little more action: tempting Jesus,
using demons to possess people, and finally appearing as a giant dragon 
who is cast into hell. This last image particularly inspired
medieval artists and writers, who depicted a scaled, shaggy-furred
creature with overgrown toenails. In Michael Pacher’s painting 
of St. Augustine and the Devil, the devil appears as an upright lizard— with a second miniature face 
glinting on his rear and. The epitome of these monster Satans appeared in Italian poet 
Dante Alighieri’s “Inferno.” Encased in the ninth circle of hell, Dante’s Satan is a three-headed,
bat-winged behemoth who feasts on sinners. But he’s also an object of pity: powerless as the panicked beating 
of his wings only encases him further in ice. The poem’s protagonist escapes from hell
by clambering over Satan’s body, and feels both disgust and sympathy
for the trapped beast— prompting the reader to consider
the pain of doing evil. By the Renaissance, the devil started
to assume a more human form. Artists painted him as a man 
with cloven hooves and curling horns inspired by Pan,
the Greek god of the wild. In his 1667 masterpiece “Paradise Lost,” English poet John Milton depicted
the devil as Lucifer, an angel who started a rebellion 
on the grounds that God is too powerful. Kicked out of heaven, 
this charismatic rebel becomes Satan, and declares that he’d rather rule in hell
than serve in heaven. Milton’s take inspired numerous depictions
of Lucifer as an ambiguous figure, rather than a purely evil one. Milton’s Lucifer later became an iconic
character for the Romantics of the 1800s, who saw him as a hero who defied higher
power in pursuit of essential truths, with tragic consequences. Meanwhile, in the German legend 
of Doctor Faust, which dates to the 16th century, we get a look at what happens

**Transcript**:
Fourteen Greenlands could fit in Africa, but you wouldn’t guess it
from most maps of the world. The fact is, every world map humans
have ever made is wrong. Actually, it’s impossible to make a map
of the world 100% right. No, not you, globe—
we know you’re accurate. Not you, Google Earth,
you’re just a digital globe. We're talking about flat maps, which,
let's face it, are way more convenient
for a lot of things. Anyway, as we were saying, it’s impossible to make a 100% accurate
flat map of a spherical planet. For a long time, people didn't even try. They just plonked places down in arbitrary
locations without any consistent scale. Then in 150 AD, the Greek mathematician
and astronomer Ptolemy systematically mapped the Earth on a grid and placed locations on the grid
according to coordinates, so maps could be checked against
others and replicated. Ptolemy built his grid out of lines
we still use today: 180 lines of latitude
and 360 lines of longitude. In spite of these advances,
people kept getting lost. Part of the problem was a— shall we say— incomplete understanding
of the world’s geography. But it was also just really difficult
to navigate using a map. Because the Earth is round, the shortest route from one place
to another is a path along a circle. If we draw this route on a flat map, it passes through every line of longitude
at a different angle. To follow the route,
you’d have to constantly shift the direction you're traveling. Any slight error would land
you in the wrong place. In 1569, Gerardus Mercator
fixed this problem. He created a world map proportioned so these curved navigational routes
would be straight, passing through every line
of longitude at the same angle and therefore allowing navigators
to set a constant bearing— in other words, travel in one direction—
for a whole journey. There was just one tiny hitch: to do this, he had to distort land masses
and bodies of water so those furthest
from the equator got larger and those closest
to the equator shrank. In spite of its inaccuracies, Mercator’s
map was very useful. In fact, it’s still widely used today,
including in online maps. But it’s still wrong! In 1925, the Goode Homolosine Projection
was created as— get this— an interrupted pseudo-cylindrical
equal area projection. What does that mean?
Not important. The point was to minimize
distortion for the entire world. The map can be land-oriented...
or ocean-oriented. Either way, the so-called orange peel map
isn’t very easy to read. The Dymaxion Projection by American
architect Buckminster Fuller in the 1940s is even better. Sorry,
did we say better? It’s not better if you want to understand
where things are in the world. It is better in the sense that there are
no visibly evident distortions of the land masses. Though if you wanted to know, say,
how far Brazil is from Nigeria, you won’t get any sense
of that from this map. The most accurate projection to date
is the AuthaGraph World Map designed by Japanese architect
Hajime Narukawa in 1999. The continents and oceans are almost
completely in proportion, and the map is rectangular,
just how we like it. Could this be the perfect map? Well... no. Since the Mercator works
for navigation and reads clearly, why bother with all these
whacky maps? Arno Peters argued that by enlarging
European and North American countries, the Mercator projection
gives white nations a sense of supremacy over non-white nations
closer to the equator. He adapted the Gall-Peters Projection,
which counteracts that particular problem, but the continents are still... stretched. Today, we rely on maps less and less
for navigation, but they still play a vital role
in education. Peters was definitely on to something: no matter what map we’re looking at, it’s a story told from the perspective
of the map’s creator that in turn shapes—perhaps unduly—
our perception of our world. Simple changes in map design, even changes that have nothing
to do with how we transfer a round Earth to a flat surface,
can completely shift our point of view.

**Transcript**:
Fourteen Greenlands could fit in Africa, but you wouldn’t guess it
from most maps of the world. The fact is, every world map humans
have ever made is wrong. Actually, it’s impossible to make a map
of the world 100% right. No, not you, globe—
we know you’re accurate. Not you, Google Earth,
you’re just a digital globe. We're talking about flat maps, which,
let's face it, are way more convenient
for a lot of things. Anyway, as we were saying, it’s impossible to make a 100% accurate
flat map of a spherical planet. For a long time, people didn't even try. They just plonked places down in arbitrary
locations without any consistent scale. Then in 150 AD, the Greek mathematician
and astronomer Ptolemy systematically mapped the Earth on a grid and placed locations on the grid
according to coordinates, so maps could be checked against
others and replicated. Ptolemy built his grid out of lines
we still use today: 180 lines of latitude
and 360 lines of longitude. In spite of these advances,
people kept getting lost. Part of the problem was a— shall we say— incomplete understanding
of the world’s geography. But it was also just really difficult
to navigate using a map. Because the Earth is round, the shortest route from one place
to another is a path along a circle. If we draw this route on a flat map, it passes through every line of longitude
at a different angle. To follow the route,
you’d have to constantly shift the direction you're traveling. Any slight error would land
you in the wrong place. In 1569, Gerardus Mercator
fixed this problem. He created a world map proportioned so these curved navigational routes
would be straight, passing through every line
of longitude at the same angle and therefore allowing navigators
to set a constant bearing— in other words, travel in one direction—
for a whole journey. There was just one tiny hitch: to do this, he had to distort land masses
and bodies of water so those furthest
from the equator got larger and those closest
to the equator shrank. In spite of its inaccuracies, Mercator’s
map was very useful. In fact, it’s still widely used today,
including in online maps. But it’s still wrong! In 1925, the Goode Homolosine Projection
was created as— get this— an interrupted pseudo-cylindrical
equal area projection. What does that mean?
Not important. The point was to minimize
distortion for the entire world. The map can be land-oriented...
or ocean-oriented. Either way, the so-called orange peel map
isn’t very easy to read. The Dymaxion Projection by American
architect Buckminster Fuller in the 1940s is even better. Sorry,
did we say better? It’s not better if you want to understand
where things are in the world. It is better in the sense that there are
no visibly evident distortions of the land masses. Though if you wanted to know, say,
how far Brazil is from Nigeria, you won’t get any sense
of that from this map. The most accurate projection to date
is the AuthaGraph World Map designed by Japanese architect
Hajime Narukawa in 1999. The continents and oceans are almost
completely in proportion, and the map is rectangular,
just how we like it. Could this be the perfect map? Well... no. Since the Mercator works
for navigation and reads clearly, why bother with all these
whacky maps? Arno Peters argued that by enlarging
European and North American countries, the Mercator projection
gives white nations a sense of supremacy over non-white nations
closer to the equator. He adapted the Gall-Peters Projection,
which counteracts that particular problem, but the continents are still... stretched. Today, we rely on maps less and less
for navigation, but they still play a vital role
in education. Peters was definitely on to something: no matter what map we’re looking at, it’s a story told from the perspective
of the map’s creator that in turn shapes—perhaps unduly—
our perception of our world. Simple changes in map design, even changes that have nothing
to do with how we transfer a round Earth to a flat surface,
can completely shift our point of view.

Hajime Narukawa in 1999. The continents and oceans are almost
completely in proportion, and the map is rectangular,
just how we like it. Could this be the perfect map? Well... no. Since the Mercator works
for navigation and reads clearly, why bother with all these
whacky maps? Arno Peters argued that by enlarging
European and North American countries, the Mercator projection
gives white nations a sense of supremacy over non-white nations
closer to the equator. He adapted the Gall-Peters Projection,
which counteracts that particular problem, but the continents are still... stretched. Today, we rely on maps less and less
for navigation, but they still play a vital role
in education. Peters was definitely on to something: no matter what map we’re looking at, it’s a story told from the perspective
of the map’s creator that in turn shapes—perhaps unduly—
our perception of our world. Simple changes in map design, even changes that have nothing
to do with how we transfer a round Earth to a flat surface,
can completely shift our point of view.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You flip a switch. Coal burns in a furnace,
which turns water into steam. That steam spins a turbine,
which activates a generator, which pushes electrons
through the wire. This current propagates through hundreds
of miles of electric cables and arrives at your home. All around the world, countless people 
are doing this every second— flipping a switch, plugging in, 
pressing an “on” button. So how much electricity 
does humanity need? The amount we collectively use
is changing fast, so to answer this question, we need to know not just how much 
the world uses today, but how much we’ll use in the future. The first step is understanding
how we measure electricity. It’s a little bit tricky. A joule is a unit of energy, but we usually don't measure
electricity in just joules. Instead, we measure it in watts. Watts tell us how much energy, 
per second, it takes to power something. One joule per second
equals one watt. It takes about .1 watts
to power a smart phone, a thousand to power your house,
a million for a small town, and a billion for a mid-size city. As of 2020, it takes 3 trillion watts
to power the entire world. But almost a billion people don’t have
access to reliable electricity. As countries become more industrialized
and more people join the grid, electricity demand is expected 
to increase about 80% by 2050. That number isn't the complete picture. We'll also have to use electricity
in completely new ways. Right now, we power a lot of things
by burning fossil fuels, emitting an unsustainable amount 
of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. We’ll have to eliminate 
these emissions entirely to ensure a sustainable future 
for humanity. The first step to doing so,
for many industries, is to switch from fossil fuels 
to electric power. We'll need to electrify cars, switch buildings heated by natural gas
furnaces to electric heat pumps, and electrify the huge amount of heat
used in industrial processes. So all told, global electricity needs
could triple by 2050. We’ll also need all that electricity 
to come from clean energy sources if it’s going to solve the problems 
caused by fossil fuels. Today, only one third of the electricity
we generate comes from clean sources. Fossil fuels are cheap and convenient, 
easy to ship, and easy to turn into electricity 
on demand. So how can we close the gap? Wind and solar power work great
for places with lots of wind and sunshine, but we can’t store and ship sunlight 
or wind the way we can transport oil. To make full use of energy from these 
sources at other times or in other places, we’d have to store it in batteries and improve our power grid infrastructure
to transport it long distances. Meanwhile, nuclear power plants 
use nuclear fission to generate carbon-free electricity. Though still more expensive
than plants that burn fossil fuels, they can be built anywhere and don’t depend on intermittent 
energy sources like the sun or wind. Researchers are currently working 
to improve nuclear waste disposal and the safety of nuclear plants. There’s another possibility we’ve been 
trying to crack since the 1940s: nuclear fusion. It involves smashing light atoms together,
so they fuse, and harnessing the energy this releases. Accidents aren't a concern
with nuclear fusion, and it doesn't produce the long-lived
radioactive waste fission does. It also doesn’t have 
the transport concerns associated with wind, solar, 
and other renewable energy sources. A major breakthrough here could
revolutionize clean energy. The same is true of nuclear fission, 
solar, and wind. Breakthroughs in any 
of these technologies, and especially in all of them together,
can change the world: not only helping us triple 
our electricity supply, but enabling us to sustain it.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You flip a switch. Coal burns in a furnace,
which turns water into steam. That steam spins a turbine,
which activates a generator, which pushes electrons
through the wire. This current propagates through hundreds
of miles of electric cables and arrives at your home. All around the world, countless people 
are doing this every second— flipping a switch, plugging in, 
pressing an “on” button. So how much electricity 
does humanity need? The amount we collectively use
is changing fast, so to answer this question, we need to know not just how much 
the world uses today, but how much we’ll use in the future. The first step is understanding
how we measure electricity. It’s a little bit tricky. A joule is a unit of energy, but we usually don't measure
electricity in just joules. Instead, we measure it in watts. Watts tell us how much energy, 
per second, it takes to power something. One joule per second
equals one watt. It takes about .1 watts
to power a smart phone, a thousand to power your house,
a million for a small town, and a billion for a mid-size city. As of 2020, it takes 3 trillion watts
to power the entire world. But almost a billion people don’t have
access to reliable electricity. As countries become more industrialized
and more people join the grid, electricity demand is expected 
to increase about 80% by 2050. That number isn't the complete picture. We'll also have to use electricity
in completely new ways. Right now, we power a lot of things
by burning fossil fuels, emitting an unsustainable amount 
of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. We’ll have to eliminate 
these emissions entirely to ensure a sustainable future 
for humanity. The first step to doing so,
for many industries, is to switch from fossil fuels 
to electric power. We'll need to electrify cars, switch buildings heated by natural gas
furnaces to electric heat pumps, and electrify the huge amount of heat
used in industrial processes. So all told, global electricity needs
could triple by 2050. We’ll also need all that electricity 
to come from clean energy sources if it’s going to solve the problems 
caused by fossil fuels. Today, only one third of the electricity
we generate comes from clean sources. Fossil fuels are cheap and convenient, 
easy to ship, and easy to turn into electricity 
on demand. So how can we close the gap? Wind and solar power work great
for places with lots of wind and sunshine, but we can’t store and ship sunlight 
or wind the way we can transport oil. To make full use of energy from these 
sources at other times or in other places, we’d have to store it in batteries and improve our power grid infrastructure
to transport it long distances. Meanwhile, nuclear power plants 
use nuclear fission to generate carbon-free electricity. Though still more expensive
than plants that burn fossil fuels, they can be built anywhere and don’t depend on intermittent 
energy sources like the sun or wind. Researchers are currently working 
to improve nuclear waste disposal and the safety of nuclear plants. There’s another possibility we’ve been 
trying to crack since the 1940s: nuclear fusion. It involves smashing light atoms together,
so they fuse, and harnessing the energy this releases. Accidents aren't a concern
with nuclear fusion, and it doesn't produce the long-lived
radioactive waste fission does. It also doesn’t have 
the transport concerns associated with wind, solar, 
and other renewable energy sources. A major breakthrough here could
revolutionize clean energy. The same is true of nuclear fission,

**Transcript**:
When I was a teen, I had terrible periods. I had crippling cramps, I leaked blood onto my clothes
and onto my bed sheets, and I had period diarrhea. And I had to miss school
one to two days a month, and I remember sitting on the couch
with my heating pads, thinking, "What's up with this?" When I ate food, I didn't leak saliva
from my salivary glands. When I went for a walk, I didn't leak fluid from my knees, 
"joint fluid." Why was menstruation so different? I wanted answers to these questions but there was no one for me to ask. My mother knew nothing about menstruation except that it was dirty and shameful
and I shouldn't talk about it. I asked girlfriends and everybody spoke in euphemisms. And finally, when I got the courage
to go to the doctor and talk about my heavy periods, I was told to eat liver. (Laughter) And when I went to the drug store
to buy my menstrual products, my 48-pack of super maxi pads, back in the day when they were the size
of a tissue box, each pad -- (Laughter) You know what I'm talking about. You have no idea how far
absorbent technology has come. (Laughter) I used to have to buy
my menstrual products in the feminine hygiene aisle. And I remember standing there, thinking, "Well, why don't I buy toilet paper
in the anal hygiene aisle?" (Laughter) Like, what's up with that? Why can't we talk about periods? And it's not about the blood,
as Freud would have you say, because if it were, there would be an ear, nose
and throat surgeon up here right now, talking about the taboos
of nose bleeds, right? And it's not even about periods, because otherwise, when we got rid
of our toxic, shameful periods when we became menopausal, we'd be elevated
to a higher social status. (Laughter) (Applause) It's just a patriarchal society is
invested in oppressing women, and at different points in our lives,
different things are used. And menstruation is used during what we in medicine call
the reproductive years. It's been around since
pretty much the beginning of time, many cultures thought
that women could spoil crops or milk, or wilt flowers. And then when religion came along, purity myths only made that worse. And medicine wasn't any help. In the 1920s and '30s there was the idea that women elaborated
something called a menotoxin. We could wilt flowers just by walking by. (Laughter) And that's what happens
when there's no diversity, right. Because there was no woman
to put her hand up and go, "Well, actually, that doesn't happen." And when you can't talk
about what's happening to your body, how do you break these myths? Because you don't even need to be a doctor to say that periods aren't toxic. If they were, why would an embryo
implant in a toxic swill? And if we all had this secret menotoxin, we could be laying waste
to crops and spoiling milk. (Laughter) Why would we have not used
our X-Women powers to get the vote sooner? (Laughter) (Applause) Even now, when I tweet about period diarrhea, as one does, (Laughter) I mention that it affects
28 percent of women. And every single time,
someone approaches me and says, "I thought I was the only one." That's how effective
that culture of shame is, that women can't even share
their experiences. So I began to think, "Well, what if everybody knew
about periods like a gynecologist? Wouldn't that be great?" Then you would all know what I know, you'd know that menstruation is a pretty unique
phenomenon among mammals. Most mammals have estrus. Humans, some primates, some bats, the elephant shrew
and the spiny mouse menstruate. And with menstruation what happens is
the brain triggers the ovary to start producing an egg. Estrogen is released and it starts to build up
the lining of the uterus, cell upon cell, like bricks. And what happens if you build
a brick wall too high without mortar? Well, it's unstable. So what happens when you ovulate? You release a hormone called progesterone, which is progestational,
it gets the uterus ready. It acts like a mortar
and it holds those bricks together. It also causes some changes to make the lining more hospitable
for implantation. If there's no pregnancy, (Whoosh) lining comes out, there's bleeding from the blood vessels
and that's the period. And I always find this point
really interesting. Because with estrus, the final signaling to get
the lining of the uterus ready actually comes from the embryo. But with menstruation, that choice comes from the ovary. It's as if choice is coded in
to our reproductive tracts. (Cheering and applause) OK, so now we know why the blood is there. And it's a pretty significant amount. It's 30 to 90 milliliters of blood, which is one to three ounces, and it can be more, and I know it seems like it's more
a lot of the times. I know. So why do we have so much blood? And why doesn't it just stay there
till the next cycle, right? Like, you didn't get pregnant,
so why can't it hang around? Well imagine if each month it got thicker
and thicker and thicker, right, like, imagine what tsunami
period that would be. (Laughter) We can't reabsorb it,
because it's too much. And it's too much because we need
a thick uterine lining for a very specific reason. Pregnancy exerts a significant
biological toll on our bodies. There is maternal mortality, there is the toll of breastfeeding and there is the toll of raising a child
until it is independent. And evolution -- (Laughter) That goes on longer
for some of us than others. (Laughter) But evolution knows
about risk-benefit ratio. And so evolution wants to maximize
the chance of a beneficial outcome. And how do you maximize the chance
of a beneficial outcome? You try to get the highest
quality embryos. And how do you get
the highest quality embryos? You make them work for it. You give them an obstacle course. So over the millennia
that we have evolved, it's been a little bit
like an arms race in the uterus, the lining getting thicker
and thicker and thicker, and the embryo getting more invasive until we reach this détente with the lining
of the uterus that we have. So we have this thick uterine lining and now it's got to come out, and how do you stop bleeding? Well, you stop a nose bleed
by pinching it, if you cut your leg,
you put pressure on it. We stop bleeding with pressure. When we menstruate, the lining of the uterus
releases substances that are made into chemicals
called prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators. And they make the uterus cramp down, they make it squeeze
on those blood vessels to stop the bleeding. They might also change
blood flow to the uterus and also cause inflammation
and that makes pain worse. And so you say, "OK,
how much pressure is generated?" And from studies
where some incredible women have volunteered
to have pressure catheters put in their uterus that they wear
their whole menstrual cycle -- God bless them, because
we wouldn't have this knowledge without, and it's very important knowledge, because the pressure
that's generated in the uterus during menstruation is 120 millimeters of mercury. "Well what's that," you say. Well, it's the amount of pressure
that's generated during the second stage of labor
when you're pushing. (Audience gasps) Right. Which, for those of you
who haven't had an unmedicated delivery, that's what it's like
when the blood pressure cuff is not quite as tight as it was
at the beginning, but it's still pretty tight, and you wish it would stop. So that kind of makes it different, right? If you start thinking
about the pain of menstruation, we wouldn't say
if someone needed to miss school because they were in the second stage
of labor and pushing, we wouldn't call them weak. We'd be like, "Oh my God,
you made it that far," right? (Laughter) And we wouldn't deny pain control to women who have
typical pain of labor, right? So it's important for us to call this pain
"typical" instead of "normal," because when we say it's normal,
it's easier to dismiss. As opposed to saying it's typical,
and we should address it. And we do have some ways
to address menstrual pain. One way is with something
called a TENS unit, which you can wear under your clothes and it sends an electrical impulse
to the nerves and muscles and no one really knows how it works, but we think it might be
the gate theory of pain, which is counterirritation. It's the same reason why,
if you hurt yourself, you rub it. Vibration travels faster
to your brain than pain does. We also have medications called nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory medications. And what they do is they block
the release of prostaglandins. They can reduce menstrual pain
for 80 percent of women. They also reduce the volume of blood
by 30 to 40 percent and they can help with period diarrhea. And we also have hormonal contraception, which gives us a thinner
lining of the uterus, so there's less prostaglandins produced and with less blood,
there's less need for cramping. Now, if those treatments fail you -- and it's important to use
that word choice, because we never fail the treatment, the treatment fails us. If that treatment fails you, you could be amongst the people who have a resistance
to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. We don't quite understand, but there are some complex mechanisms why those medications
just don't work for some women. It's also possible that you could have another reason for painful periods. You could have a condition
called endometriosis, where the lining of the uterus
is growing in the pelvic cavity, causing inflammation
and scar tissue and adhesions. And there may be other mechanisms
we don't quite understand yet, because it's a possibility
that pain thresholds could be different due to very complex biological mechanisms. But we're only going to find that out
by talking about it. It shouldn't be an act of feminism to know how your body works. It shouldn't -- (Applause) It shouldn't be an act of feminism to ask for help when you're suffering. The era of menstrual taboos is over. (Cheers and applause) The only curse here is the ability to convince
half the population that the very biological machinery
that perpetuates the species, that gives everything that we have, is somehow dirty or toxic. And I'm not going to stand for it. (Applause) And the way we break that curse? It's knowledge. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)

the lining of the uterus ready actually comes from the embryo. But with menstruation, that choice comes from the ovary. It's as if choice is coded in
to our reproductive tracts. (Cheering and applause) OK, so now we know why the blood is there. And it's a pretty significant amount. It's 30 to 90 milliliters of blood, which is one to three ounces, and it can be more, and I know it seems like it's more
a lot of the times. I know. So why do we have so much blood? And why doesn't it just stay there
till the next cycle, right? Like, you didn't get pregnant,
so why can't it hang around? Well imagine if each month it got thicker
and thicker and thicker, right, like, imagine what tsunami
period that would be. (Laughter) We can't reabsorb it,
because it's too much. And it's too much because we need
a thick uterine lining for a very specific reason. Pregnancy exerts a significant
biological toll on our bodies. There is maternal mortality, there is the toll of breastfeeding and there is the toll of raising a child
until it is independent. And evolution -- (Laughter) That goes on longer
for some of us than others. (Laughter) But evolution knows
about risk-benefit ratio. And so evolution wants to maximize
the chance of a beneficial outcome. And how do you maximize the chance
of a beneficial outcome? You try to get the highest
quality embryos. And how do you get
the highest quality embryos? You make them work for it. You give them an obstacle course. So over the millennia
that we have evolved, it's been a little bit
like an arms race in the uterus, the lining getting thicker
and thicker and thicker, and the embryo getting more invasive until we reach this détente with the lining
of the uterus that we have. So we have this thick uterine lining and now it's got to come out, and how do you stop bleeding? Well, you stop a nose bleed
by pinching it, if you cut your leg,
you put pressure on it. We stop bleeding with pressure. When we menstruate, the lining of the uterus
releases substances that are made into chemicals
called prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators. And they make the uterus cramp down, they make it squeeze
on those blood vessels to stop the bleeding. They might also change
blood flow to the uterus and also cause inflammation
and that makes pain worse. And so you say, "OK,
how much pressure is generated?" And from studies
where some incredible women have volunteered
to have pressure catheters put in their uterus that they wear
their whole menstrual cycle -- God bless them, because
we wouldn't have this knowledge without, and it's very important knowledge, because the pressure
that's generated in the uterus during menstruation is 120 millimeters of mercury. "Well what's that," you say. Well, it's the amount of pressure
that's generated during the second stage of labor
when you're pushing. (Audience gasps) Right. Which, for those of you
who haven't had an unmedicated delivery, that's what it's like
when the blood pressure cuff is not quite as tight as it was
at the beginning, but it's still pretty tight, and you wish it would stop. So that kind of makes it different, right? If you start thinking
about the pain of menstruation, we wouldn't say
if someone needed to miss school because they were in the second stage
of labor and pushing, we wouldn't call them weak. We'd be like, "Oh my God,
you made it that far," right? (Laughter) And we wouldn't deny pain control to women who have
typical pain of labor, right? So it's important for us to call this pain
"typical" instead of "normal," because when we say it's normal,
it's easier to dismiss. As opposed to saying it's typical,
and we should address it. And we do have some ways
to address menstrual pain. One way is with something
called a TENS unit, which you can wear under your clothes and it sends an electrical impulse
to the nerves and muscles and no one really knows how it works, but we think it might be
the gate theory of pain, which is counterirritation. It's the same reason why,
if you hurt yourself, you rub it. Vibration travels faster
to your brain than pain does. We also have medications called nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory medications. And what they do is they block
the release of prostaglandins. They can reduce menstrual pain
for 80 percent of women. They also reduce the volume of blood
by 30 to 40 percent and they can help with period diarrhea. And we also have hormonal contraception, which gives us a thinner
lining of the uterus, so there's less prostaglandins produced and with less blood,
there's less need for cramping. Now, if those treatments fail you -- and it's important to use
that word choice, because we never fail the treatment, the treatment fails us. If that treatment fails you, you could be amongst the people who have a resistance
to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. We don't quite understand, but there are some complex mechanisms why those medications
just don't work for some women. It's also possible that you could have another reason for painful periods. You could have a condition
called endometriosis, where the lining of the uterus
is growing in the pelvic cavity, causing inflammation
and scar tissue and adhesions. And there may be other mechanisms
we don't quite understand yet, because it's a possibility
that pain thresholds could be different due to very complex biological mechanisms. But we're only going to find that out
by talking about it. It shouldn't be an act of feminism to know how your body works. It shouldn't -- (Applause) It shouldn't be an act of feminism to ask for help when you're suffering. The era of menstrual taboos is over. (Cheers and applause) The only curse here is the ability to convince
half the population that the very biological machinery
that perpetuates the species, that gives everything that we have, is somehow dirty or toxic. And I'm not going to stand for it. (Applause) And the way we break that curse? It's knowledge. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically atomic clocks and timekeeping.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match. This question asks about the properties of a specific entity (cesium-133) and its relevance to a particular concept (atomic clocks). Similarly, the ground truth MCQ asks about the hormone released during ovulation.

But please note that the content and intent of Question 5 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5 (with a big caveat that it's not a good match)

**Transcript**:
When I was a teen, I had terrible periods. I had crippling cramps, I leaked blood onto my clothes
and onto my bed sheets, and I had period diarrhea. And I had to miss school
one to two days a month, and I remember sitting on the couch
with my heating pads, thinking, "What's up with this?" When I ate food, I didn't leak saliva
from my salivary glands. When I went for a walk, I didn't leak fluid from my knees, 
"joint fluid." Why was menstruation so different? I wanted answers to these questions but there was no one for me to ask. My mother knew nothing about menstruation except that it was dirty and shameful
and I shouldn't talk about it. I asked girlfriends and everybody spoke in euphemisms. And finally, when I got the courage
to go to the doctor and talk about my heavy periods, I was told to eat liver. (Laughter) And when I went to the drug store
to buy my menstrual products, my 48-pack of super maxi pads, back in the day when they were the size
of a tissue box, each pad -- (Laughter) You know what I'm talking about. You have no idea how far
absorbent technology has come. (Laughter) I used to have to buy
my menstrual products in the feminine hygiene aisle. And I remember standing there, thinking, "Well, why don't I buy toilet paper
in the anal hygiene aisle?" (Laughter) Like, what's up with that? Why can't we talk about periods? And it's not about the blood,
as Freud would have you say, because if it were, there would be an ear, nose
and throat surgeon up here right now, talking about the taboos
of nose bleeds, right? And it's not even about periods, because otherwise, when we got rid
of our toxic, shameful periods when we became menopausal, we'd be elevated
to a higher social status. (Laughter) (Applause) It's just a patriarchal society is
invested in oppressing women, and at different points in our lives,
different things are used. And menstruation is used during what we in medicine call
the reproductive years. It's been around since
pretty much the beginning of time, many cultures thought
that women could spoil crops or milk, or wilt flowers. And then when religion came along, purity myths only made that worse. And medicine wasn't any help. In the 1920s and '30s there was the idea that women elaborated
something called a menotoxin. We could wilt flowers just by walking by. (Laughter) And that's what happens
when there's no diversity, right. Because there was no woman
to put her hand up and go, "Well, actually, that doesn't happen." And when you can't talk
about what's happening to your body, how do you break these myths? Because you don't even need to be a doctor to say that periods aren't toxic. If they were, why would an embryo
implant in a toxic swill? And if we all had this secret menotoxin, we could be laying waste
to crops and spoiling milk. (Laughter) Why would we have not used
our X-Women powers to get the vote sooner? (Laughter) (Applause) Even now, when I tweet about period diarrhea, as one does, (Laughter) I mention that it affects
28 percent of women. And every single time,
someone approaches me and says, "I thought I was the only one." That's how effective
that culture of shame is, that women can't even share
their experiences. So I began to think, "Well, what if everybody knew
about periods like a gynecologist? Wouldn't that be great?" Then you would all know what I know, you'd know that menstruation is a pretty unique
phenomenon among mammals. Most mammals have estrus. Humans, some primates, some bats, the elephant shrew
and the spiny mouse menstruate. And with menstruation what happens is
the brain triggers the ovary to start producing an egg. Estrogen is released and it starts to build up
the lining of the uterus, cell upon cell, like bricks. And what happens if you build
a brick wall too high without mortar? Well, it's unstable. So what happens when you ovulate? You release a hormone called progesterone, which is progestational,
it gets the uterus ready. It acts like a mortar
and it holds those bricks together. It also causes some changes to make the lining more hospitable
for implantation. If there's no pregnancy, (Whoosh) lining comes out, there's bleeding from the blood vessels
and that's the period. And I always find this point
really interesting. Because with estrus, the final signaling to get
the lining of the uterus ready actually comes from the embryo. But with menstruation, that choice comes from the ovary. It's as if choice is coded in
to our reproductive tracts. (Cheering and applause) OK, so now we know why the blood is there. And it's a pretty significant amount. It's 30 to 90 milliliters of blood, which is one to three ounces, and it can be more, and I know it seems like it's more

**Transcript**:
Thousands of years ago,
the Romans invented a material that allowed them to build 
much of their sprawling civilization. Pliny the Elder praised an imposing
sea wall made from the stuff as “impregnable to the waves
and every day stronger.” He was right: much of this construction
still stands, having survived millennia of battering 
by environmental forces that would topple modern buildings. Today, our roads, sidewalks, bridges, 
and skyscrapers are made of a similar, though 
less durable, material called concrete. There’s three tons of it for every person 
on Earth. And over the next 40 years, 
we’ll use enough of it to build the equivalent of New York City 
every single month. Concrete has shaped our skylines, but that's not the only way
it's changed our world. It’s also played a surprisingly large role
in rising global temperatures over the last century, a trend that has already 
changed the world, and threatens to even more drastically
in the coming decades. To be fair to concrete, basically
everything humanity does contributes to the greenhouse gas 
emissions that cause global warming. Most of those emissions come 
from industrial processes we often aren’t aware of, 
but touch every aspect of our lives. Look around your home. Refrigeration— 
along with other heating and cooling— makes up about 6% of total emissions. Agriculture, which produces our food,
accounts for 18%. Electricity is responsible for 27%. Walk outside, and the cars zipping past,
planes overhead, trains ferrying commuters to work— transportation, including shipping, contributes 16% 
of greenhouse gas emissions. Even before we use any of these things,
making them produces emissions— a lot of emissions. Making materials— concrete, steel, plastic, glass, 
aluminum and everything else— accounts for 31%
of greenhouse gas emissions. Concrete alone is responsible for 8% 
of all carbon emissions worldwide. And it’s much more difficult to reduce 
the emissions from concrete than from other building materials. The problem is cement, 
one of the four ingredients in concrete. It holds the other three ingredients—
gravel, sand, and water— together. Unfortunately, it's impossible to make
cement without generating carbon dioxide. The essential ingredient in cement
is calcium oxide, CaO. We get that calcium oxide from limestone, which is mostly made of calcium carbonate:
CaCO3. We extract CaO from CaCO3
by heating limestone. What’s left is CO2— carbon dioxide. So for every ton of cement we produce,
we release one ton of carbon dioxide. As tricky as this problem is, it means concrete could help
us change the world a third time: by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions
and stabilizing our climate. Right now, there’s no 100% clean concrete, but there are some great ideas
to help us get there. Cement manufacturing also produces
greenhouse gas emissions by burning fossil fuels 
to heat the limestone. Heating the limestone with clean 
electricity or alternative fuels instead would eliminate those emissions. For the carbon dioxide from
the limestone itself, our best bet is carbon capture: specifically, capturing the carbon
right where it’s produced, before it enters the atmosphere. Devices that do this already exist, but they aren’t widely used because
there’s no economic incentive. Transporting and then storing 
the captured carbon can be expensive. To solve these problems, one company has found a way to store
captured CO2 permanently in the concrete itself. Other innovators are tinkering with 
the fundamental chemistry of concrete. Some are investigating ways 
to reduce emissions by decreasing the cement in concrete. Still others have been working
to uncover and replicate the secrets of Roman concrete. They found that Pliny’s remark 
is literally true. The Romans used volcanic ash 
in their cement. When the ash interacted with seawater,
the seawater strengthened it— making their concrete stronger and more 
long-lasting than any we use today. By adding these findings to an arsenal 
of modern innovations, hopefully we can replicate their success— both by making long lasting structures, and ensuring our descendants can admire
them thousands of years from now.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

**Transcript**:
Thousands of years ago,
the Romans invented a material that allowed them to build 
much of their sprawling civilization. Pliny the Elder praised an imposing
sea wall made from the stuff as “impregnable to the waves
and every day stronger.” He was right: much of this construction
still stands, having survived millennia of battering 
by environmental forces that would topple modern buildings. Today, our roads, sidewalks, bridges, 
and skyscrapers are made of a similar, though 
less durable, material called concrete. There’s three tons of it for every person 
on Earth. And over the next 40 years, 
we’ll use enough of it to build the equivalent of New York City 
every single month. Concrete has shaped our skylines, but that's not the only way
it's changed our world. It’s also played a surprisingly large role
in rising global temperatures over the last century, a trend that has already 
changed the world, and threatens to even more drastically
in the coming decades. To be fair to concrete, basically
everything humanity does contributes to the greenhouse gas 
emissions that cause global warming. Most of those emissions come 
from industrial processes we often aren’t aware of, 
but touch every aspect of our lives. Look around your home. Refrigeration— 
along with other heating and cooling— makes up about 6% of total emissions. Agriculture, which produces our food,
accounts for 18%. Electricity is responsible for 27%. Walk outside, and the cars zipping past,
planes overhead, trains ferrying commuters to work— transportation, including shipping, contributes 16% 
of greenhouse gas emissions. Even before we use any of these things,
making them produces emissions— a lot of emissions. Making materials— concrete, steel, plastic, glass, 
aluminum and everything else— accounts for 31%
of greenhouse gas emissions. Concrete alone is responsible for 8% 
of all carbon emissions worldwide. And it’s much more difficult to reduce 
the emissions from concrete than from other building materials. The problem is cement, 
one of the four ingredients in concrete. It holds the other three ingredients—
gravel, sand, and water— together. Unfortunately, it's impossible to make
cement without generating carbon dioxide. The essential ingredient in cement
is calcium oxide, CaO. We get that calcium oxide from limestone, which is mostly made of calcium carbonate:
CaCO3. We extract CaO from CaCO3
by heating limestone. What’s left is CO2— carbon dioxide. So for every ton of cement we produce,
we release one ton of carbon dioxide. As tricky as this problem is, it means concrete could help
us change the world a third time: by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions
and stabilizing our climate. Right now, there’s no 100% clean concrete, but there are some great ideas
to help us get there. Cement manufacturing also produces
greenhouse gas emissions by burning fossil fuels 
to heat the limestone. Heating the limestone with clean 
electricity or alternative fuels instead would eliminate those emissions. For the carbon dioxide from
the limestone itself, our best bet is carbon capture: specifically, capturing the carbon
right where it’s produced, before it enters the atmosphere. Devices that do this already exist, but they aren’t widely used because
there’s no economic incentive. Transporting and then storing 
the captured carbon can be expensive. To solve these problems, one company has found a way to store
captured CO2 permanently in the concrete itself. Other innovators are tinkering with 
the fundamental chemistry of concrete. Some are investigating ways 
to reduce emissions by decreasing the cement in concrete. Still others have been working
to uncover and replicate the secrets of Roman concrete. They found that Pliny’s remark 
is literally true. The Romans used volcanic ash 
in their cement. When the ash interacted with seawater,
the seawater strengthened it— making their concrete stronger and more 
long-lasting than any we use today. By adding these findings to an arsenal 
of modern innovations, hopefully we can replicate their success— both by making long lasting structures, and ensuring our descendants can admire
them thousands of years from now.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as the internet, online harassment, and radicalization, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about the ancient Romans' method of making concrete.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match, but only in terms of format (True/False question). However, the content and intent of Question 1 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and it's not possible to provide a meaningful index of the most similar generated MCQ.

If you could provide generated MCQs that are related to the topic of the transcript (concrete, ancient Romans, etc.), I would be happy to help you identify the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As of 2020, the world’s biggest 
lithium-ion battery is hooked up to the Southern California 
power grid and can provide 250 million watts 
of power, or enough to power about 250,000 homes. But it’s actually not the biggest battery
in the world: these lakes are. Wait— how can a pair of lakes 
be a battery? To answer that question, 
it helps to define a battery: it’s simply something that stores energy
and releases it on demand. The lithium-ion batteries that power 
our phones, laptops, and cars are just one type. They store energy in lithium ions. To release the energy, the ions 
are separated from their electrons, then rejoined at the other end 
of the battery as a new molecule with lower energy. How do the two lakes 
store and release energy? First, one is 300 meters higher 
than the other. Electricity powers pumps that move
billions of liters of water from the lower lake to the higher one. This stores the energy by giving the water
extra gravitational potential energy. Then, when there’s high demand
for electricity, valves open, releasing the stored energy 
by letting water flow downhill to power 6 giant turbines that can 
generate 3 billion watts of power for 10 hours. We’re going to need more and more 
giant batteries. That’s because right now, generating
enough electricity to power the world produces an unsustainable amount 
of greenhouse gas: 14 billion tons per year. We’ll need to get that number 
down to net-zero. But many clean energy sources 
can’t produce electricity 24/7. So to make the switch, we need a way to
store the electricity until it's needed. That means we need grid-scale batteries: batteries big enough 
to power multiple cities. Unfortunately, neither of the giant
batteries we’ve talked about so far can solve this problem. The two lakes setup requires specific
geography, takes up a lot of land, and has high upfront costs to build. The giant lithium-ion battery
in California, meanwhile, can power about 250,000 homes, yes,
but only for an hour. Lithium-ion batteries are great for things
that don’t use a lot of power. But to store a lot of energy, 
they have to be huge and heavy. That’s why electric planes aren’t a thing: the best electric plane 
can only carry two people for about 1,000 kilometers on one charge, or its batteries would be too heavy 
to fly. A typical commercial jet can carry 
300 people over 14,000 km before refueling. Lithium-ion batteries also require 
certain heavy metals to make. These resources are limited, and mining
them often causes environmental damage. Inventors all over the world are rising 
to the challenge of making batteries that can meet 
our needs— many of them even weirder 
than the two lakes. One company is building 
a skyscraper battery. When the sun is shining, 
a crane powered by solar energy piles blocks on top of each other 
in a tower. At night, the cranes let gravity
pull the blocks down and use the resulting power 
to spin generators. Though there have been
some early setbacks, another promising approach involves
heating up salts until they melt. The molten salt can be stored until 
there’s a high demand for electricity, then used to boil water. The steam can power turbines
that generate electricity. Another idea: bio-batteries made 
from paper, powered by bacteria, and activated by spit. Bacteria release energy in the form 
of electrons when they metabolize glucose, and at least one species of bacteria can
transfer those electrons outside its cells,
completing a circuit. While these batteries won’t power
a city, or even a house, they don't have the waste and cost
concerns of traditional batteries. From vast mountain lakes 
to microscopic bacteria, from seawater batteries
that bypass the need for heavy metals to nuclear batteries
that power deep space missions, we're constantly rethinking
what a battery can be. The next unlikely battery could
be hiding in plain sight— just waiting to be discovered 
and help us achieve a sustainable future.

that don’t use a lot of power. But to store a lot of energy, 
they have to be huge and heavy. That’s why electric planes aren’t a thing: the best electric plane 
can only carry two people for about 1,000 kilometers on one charge, or its batteries would be too heavy 
to fly. A typical commercial jet can carry 
300 people over 14,000 km before refueling. Lithium-ion batteries also require 
certain heavy metals to make. These resources are limited, and mining
them often causes environmental damage. Inventors all over the world are rising 
to the challenge of making batteries that can meet 
our needs— many of them even weirder 
than the two lakes. One company is building 
a skyscraper battery. When the sun is shining, 
a crane powered by solar energy piles blocks on top of each other 
in a tower. At night, the cranes let gravity
pull the blocks down and use the resulting power 
to spin generators. Though there have been
some early setbacks, another promising approach involves
heating up salts until they melt. The molten salt can be stored until 
there’s a high demand for electricity, then used to boil water. The steam can power turbines
that generate electricity. Another idea: bio-batteries made 
from paper, powered by bacteria, and activated by spit. Bacteria release energy in the form 
of electrons when they metabolize glucose, and at least one species of bacteria can
transfer those electrons outside its cells,
completing a circuit. While these batteries won’t power
a city, or even a house, they don't have the waste and cost
concerns of traditional batteries. From vast mountain lakes 
to microscopic bacteria, from seawater batteries
that bypass the need for heavy metals to nuclear batteries
that power deep space missions, we're constantly rethinking
what a battery can be. The next unlikely battery could

**Transcript**:
As of 2020, the world’s biggest 
lithium-ion battery is hooked up to the Southern California 
power grid and can provide 250 million watts 
of power, or enough to power about 250,000 homes. But it’s actually not the biggest battery
in the world: these lakes are. Wait— how can a pair of lakes 
be a battery? To answer that question, 
it helps to define a battery: it’s simply something that stores energy
and releases it on demand. The lithium-ion batteries that power 
our phones, laptops, and cars are just one type. They store energy in lithium ions. To release the energy, the ions 
are separated from their electrons, then rejoined at the other end 
of the battery as a new molecule with lower energy. How do the two lakes 
store and release energy? First, one is 300 meters higher 
than the other. Electricity powers pumps that move
billions of liters of water from the lower lake to the higher one. This stores the energy by giving the water
extra gravitational potential energy. Then, when there’s high demand
for electricity, valves open, releasing the stored energy 
by letting water flow downhill to power 6 giant turbines that can 
generate 3 billion watts of power for 10 hours. We’re going to need more and more 
giant batteries. That’s because right now, generating
enough electricity to power the world produces an unsustainable amount 
of greenhouse gas: 14 billion tons per year. We’ll need to get that number 
down to net-zero. But many clean energy sources 
can’t produce electricity 24/7. So to make the switch, we need a way to
store the electricity until it's needed. That means we need grid-scale batteries: batteries big enough 
to power multiple cities. Unfortunately, neither of the giant
batteries we’ve talked about so far can solve this problem. The two lakes setup requires specific
geography, takes up a lot of land, and has high upfront costs to build. The giant lithium-ion battery
in California, meanwhile, can power about 250,000 homes, yes,
but only for an hour. Lithium-ion batteries are great for things
that don’t use a lot of power. But to store a lot of energy, 
they have to be huge and heavy. That’s why electric planes aren’t a thing: the best electric plane 
can only carry two people for about 1,000 kilometers on one charge, or its batteries would be too heavy 
to fly. A typical commercial jet can carry 
300 people over 14,000 km before refueling. Lithium-ion batteries also require 
certain heavy metals to make. These resources are limited, and mining
them often causes environmental damage. Inventors all over the world are rising 
to the challenge of making batteries that can meet 
our needs— many of them even weirder 
than the two lakes. One company is building 
a skyscraper battery. When the sun is shining, 
a crane powered by solar energy piles blocks on top of each other 
in a tower. At night, the cranes let gravity

to spin generators. Though there have been
some early setbacks, another promising approach involves

**Transcript**:
Two frogs are minding their own business
in the swamp when WHAM— they’re kidnapped. They come to in a kitchen, 
captives of a menacing chef. He boils up a pot of water 
and lobs one of the frogs in. But it’s having none of this. The second its toes hit the scalding water
it jumps right out the window. The chef refills the pot, but this time 
he doesn’t turn on the heat. He plops the second frog in,
and this frog’s okay with that. The chef turns the heat on, very low, 
and the temperature of water slowly rises. So slowly that the frog doesn’t notice. In fact, it basks in the balmy water. Only when the surface begins to bubble
does the frog realize: it’s toast. What’s funny about this parable is that
it’s not scientifically true... for frogs. In reality, a frog will detect slowly
heating water and leap to safety. Humans, on the other hand,
are a different story. We’re perfectly happy to sit in the pot 
and slowly turn up the heat, all the while insisting it isn’t our hand
on the dial, arguing about whether we can 
trust thermometers, and questioning— 
even if they’re right, does it matter? It does. Since 1850, global average temperatures 
have risen by 1 degree Celsius. That may not sound like a lot, but it is. Why? 1 degree is an average. Many places have already gotten
much warmer than that. Some places in the Arctic 
have already warmed 4 degrees. If global average temperatures 
increase 1 more degree, the coldest nights in the Arctic
might get 10 degrees warmer. The warmest days in Mumbai 
might get 5 degrees hotter. So how did we get here? Almost everything that makes modern life
possible relies on fossil fuels: coal, oil, and gas full of carbon 
from ancient organic matter. When we burn fossil fuels, we release carbon dioxide 
that builds up in our atmosphere, where it remains for hundreds 
or even thousands of years, letting heat in, but not out. The heat comes from sunlight, which passes
through the atmosphere to Earth, where it gets absorbed 
and warms everything up. Warm objects emit infrared radiation,
which should pass back out into space, because most atmospheric gases 
don’t absorb it. But greenhouse gases—
carbon dioxide and methane— do absorb infrared wavelengths. So when we add more of those gases 
to the atmosphere, less heat makes it back out to space, 
and our planet warms up. If we keep emitting greenhouse gases 
at our current pace, scientists predict temperatures
will rise 4 degrees from their pre-industrial levels by 2100. They’ve identified 1.5 degrees of warming— global averages half a degree warmer 
than today’s— as a threshold beyond which 
the negative impacts of climate change will become increasingly severe. To keep from crossing that threshold, we need to get our greenhouse gas 
emissions down to zero as fast as possible. Or rather, we have to get emissions
down to what's called net zero, meaning we may still be putting some
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but we take out as much as we put in. This doesn’t mean we can just keep 
emitting and sequester all that carbon— we couldn’t keep up with our emissions 
through natural methods, and technological solutions would
be prohibitively expensive and require huge amounts
of permanent storage. Instead, while we switch 
from coal, oil, and natural gas to clean energy and fuels, 
which will take time, we can mitigate the damage by removing
carbon from the atmosphere. Jumping out of the proverbial pot 
isn’t an option, but we can do something the frogs can’t: reach over, and turn down the heat.

**Transcript**:
Two frogs are minding their own business
in the swamp when WHAM— they’re kidnapped. They come to in a kitchen, 
captives of a menacing chef. He boils up a pot of water 
and lobs one of the frogs in. But it’s having none of this. The second its toes hit the scalding water
it jumps right out the window. The chef refills the pot, but this time 
he doesn’t turn on the heat. He plops the second frog in,
and this frog’s okay with that. The chef turns the heat on, very low, 
and the temperature of water slowly rises. So slowly that the frog doesn’t notice. In fact, it basks in the balmy water. Only when the surface begins to bubble
does the frog realize: it’s toast. What’s funny about this parable is that
it’s not scientifically true... for frogs. In reality, a frog will detect slowly
heating water and leap to safety. Humans, on the other hand,
are a different story. We’re perfectly happy to sit in the pot 
and slowly turn up the heat, all the while insisting it isn’t our hand
on the dial, arguing about whether we can 
trust thermometers, and questioning— 
even if they’re right, does it matter? It does. Since 1850, global average temperatures 
have risen by 1 degree Celsius. That may not sound like a lot, but it is. Why? 1 degree is an average. Many places have already gotten
much warmer than that. Some places in the Arctic 
have already warmed 4 degrees. If global average temperatures 
increase 1 more degree, the coldest nights in the Arctic
might get 10 degrees warmer. The warmest days in Mumbai 
might get 5 degrees hotter. So how did we get here? Almost everything that makes modern life
possible relies on fossil fuels: coal, oil, and gas full of carbon 
from ancient organic matter. When we burn fossil fuels, we release carbon dioxide 
that builds up in our atmosphere, where it remains for hundreds 
or even thousands of years, letting heat in, but not out. The heat comes from sunlight, which passes
through the atmosphere to Earth, where it gets absorbed 
and warms everything up. Warm objects emit infrared radiation,
which should pass back out into space, because most atmospheric gases 
don’t absorb it. But greenhouse gases—
carbon dioxide and methane— do absorb infrared wavelengths. So when we add more of those gases 
to the atmosphere, less heat makes it back out to space, 
and our planet warms up. If we keep emitting greenhouse gases 
at our current pace, scientists predict temperatures
will rise 4 degrees from their pre-industrial levels by 2100. They’ve identified 1.5 degrees of warming— global averages half a degree warmer 
than today’s— as a threshold beyond which 
the negative impacts of climate change will become increasingly severe. To keep from crossing that threshold, we need to get our greenhouse gas 
emissions down to zero as fast as possible. Or rather, we have to get emissions
down to what's called net zero, meaning we may still be putting some
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but we take out as much as we put in. This doesn’t mean we can just keep 
emitting and sequester all that carbon— we couldn’t keep up with our emissions 
through natural methods, and technological solutions would
be prohibitively expensive and require huge amounts
of permanent storage. Instead, while we switch 
from coal, oil, and natural gas to clean energy and fuels, 
which will take time, we can mitigate the damage by removing
carbon from the atmosphere. Jumping out of the proverbial pot 
isn’t an option, but we can do something the frogs can’t: reach over, and turn down the heat.

**Transcript**:
If you were a jackrabbit hopping 
through the desert, you’d be glad to stumble— 
well, maybe not stumble— across a cactus: the succulent flesh 
of these plants is a water source for many desert animals. Native to the Americas and known 
for their spines and succulent stems, cacti of all shapes and sizes have evolved
to not just survive, but thrive, in some of the harshest desert climates 
on Earth. So how do they do it? A cactus’s spines are one
key to its survival— but not for the reason you might think. Take a look at the prickly pear. Its spines are highly modified leaves. A normal leaf’s large surface area would
be ill-suited to the desert, transpiring massive amounts 
of water under the baking sun. The dramatically reduced surface area
of the spines limits water loss. They also shade the cactus 
and reflect the sun’s rays, reducing the plant's core temperature
during the heat of the day. Then, at night, 
when air temperatures plummet, the spines act as an insulating layer, keeping the cactus from cooling 
down too much. These functions are just as important,
if not more, than defending against predators. From Cuba to Mexico, and as far south 
as Brazil and Peru, Melon cacti grow on limestone soils 
in seasonally dry tropical forests, where they're constantly exposed
to the beating sun. They rely on another adaptation
common to cacti: a thick skin, which is coated in a waxy substance
called a cuticle that limits water loss. Meanwhile, the stomata— tiny holes that allow the exchange
of gases that enable photosynthesis— remain firmly closed 
until night when they open. The lower temperatures at night 
mean the cactus loses less water from the stem when the stomata open. The bulk of the plant acts 
as a large barrel of water, storing it for times of need. But to survive the desert, 
a cactus can’t just limit water loss— it has to be prepared 
to take full advantage of the rare situations where water
is readily available. In North America’s Sonoran Desert, the towering Saguaro cactus can grow
up to 20 meters tall and live for up to 200 years. Woody tissue, like the kind found 
in tree trunks, give the Saguaro its height, but the Saguaro survives 
with way less water than most trees. Most of its roots are only 
a few inches deep. Just below the soil’s surface, 
they spread out laterally for meters and hold the plant in place. Even its single deepest root,
the taproot, extends less than one meter 
into the ground. After a rain, the lateral roots
respond in real time, rapidly growing and spreading. They produce ephemeral rain roots 
that quickly take up the available water. The water is then pulled
up into the plant body and stored in cells that contain mucilage, a gluey substance that clings 
to water molecules and stops them from evaporating 
if the plant’s tissue is ever damaged and exposed. As the soil dries after the rain, the small rain roots also start to dry 
and wither away, and the cactus awaits the next time
it can take advantage of a shower. Taken together, these features make cacti
well-equipped to survive their environments, from the driest desert
to... a tropical rainforest? The mistletoe cactus can live on the
branches of trees in the rainforest. Though there’s lots of water around,
not much of it reaches the cactus here, and there's nowhere for its roots to go. So even here, the cactus survives 
using adaptations that long ago helped its ancestors 
survive the desert.

**Transcript**:
If you were a jackrabbit hopping 
through the desert, you’d be glad to stumble— 
well, maybe not stumble— across a cactus: the succulent flesh 
of these plants is a water source for many desert animals. Native to the Americas and known 
for their spines and succulent stems, cacti of all shapes and sizes have evolved
to not just survive, but thrive, in some of the harshest desert climates 
on Earth. So how do they do it? A cactus’s spines are one
key to its survival— but not for the reason you might think. Take a look at the prickly pear. Its spines are highly modified leaves. A normal leaf’s large surface area would
be ill-suited to the desert, transpiring massive amounts 
of water under the baking sun. The dramatically reduced surface area
of the spines limits water loss. They also shade the cactus 
and reflect the sun’s rays, reducing the plant's core temperature
during the heat of the day. Then, at night, 
when air temperatures plummet, the spines act as an insulating layer, keeping the cactus from cooling 
down too much. These functions are just as important,
if not more, than defending against predators. From Cuba to Mexico, and as far south 
as Brazil and Peru, Melon cacti grow on limestone soils 
in seasonally dry tropical forests, where they're constantly exposed
to the beating sun. They rely on another adaptation
common to cacti: a thick skin, which is coated in a waxy substance
called a cuticle that limits water loss. Meanwhile, the stomata— tiny holes that allow the exchange
of gases that enable photosynthesis— remain firmly closed 
until night when they open. The lower temperatures at night 
mean the cactus loses less water from the stem when the stomata open. The bulk of the plant acts 
as a large barrel of water, storing it for times of need. But to survive the desert, 
a cactus can’t just limit water loss— it has to be prepared 
to take full advantage of the rare situations where water
is readily available. In North America’s Sonoran Desert, the towering Saguaro cactus can grow
up to 20 meters tall and live for up to 200 years. Woody tissue, like the kind found 
in tree trunks, give the Saguaro its height, but the Saguaro survives 
with way less water than most trees. Most of its roots are only 
a few inches deep. Just below the soil’s surface, 
they spread out laterally for meters and hold the plant in place. Even its single deepest root,
the taproot, extends less than one meter 
into the ground. After a rain, the lateral roots
respond in real time, rapidly growing and spreading. They produce ephemeral rain roots 
that quickly take up the available water. The water is then pulled
up into the plant body and stored in cells that contain mucilage, a gluey substance that clings 
to water molecules and stops them from evaporating 
if the plant’s tissue is ever damaged and exposed. As the soil dries after the rain, the small rain roots also start to dry 
and wither away, and the cactus awaits the next time
it can take advantage of a shower. Taken together, these features make cacti
well-equipped to survive their environments, from the driest desert
to... a tropical rainforest? The mistletoe cactus can live on the
branches of trees in the rainforest. Though there’s lots of water around,
not much of it reaches the cactus here, and there's nowhere for its roots to go. So even here, the cactus survives 
using adaptations that long ago helped its ancestors 
survive the desert.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
If you were buying a car in 1899, you would’ve had three major
options to choose from. You could buy a steam-powered car. Typically relying on gas-powered boilers, 
these could drive as far as you wanted— provided you also wanted to lug
around extra water to refuel and didn’t mind waiting 30 minutes
for your engine to heat up. Alternatively, you could buy
a car powered by gasoline. However, the internal combustion engines
in these models required dangerous hand-cranking to start and emitted loud noises
and foul-smelling exhaust while driving. So your best bet was probably
option number three: a battery-powered electric vehicle. These cars were quick to start,
clean and quiet to run, and if you lived somewhere with access 
to electricity, easy to refuel overnight. If this seems like an easy choice,
you're not alone. By the end of the 19th century, 
nearly 40% of American cars were electric. In cities with early electric systems, battery-powered cars were 
a popular and reliable alternative to their occasionally explosive 
competitors. But electric vehicles had one
major problem— batteries. Early car batteries were expensive
and inefficient. Many inventors, including Thomas Edison, tried to build batteries 
that stored more electricity. Others even built exchange stations 
in urban areas to swap out dead batteries for charged ones. But these measures weren’t enough to allow
electric vehicles to make long trips. And at over twice the price 
of a gas-powered car, many couldn’t afford these luxury items. At the same time, oil discoveries
lowered the price of gasoline, and new advances made internal combustion
engines more appealing. Electric starters removed the need
for hand-cranking, mufflers made engines quieter and 
rubber engine mounts reduced vibration. In 1908, Ford released the Model T; a cheap, high-quality gas-powered car 
that captured the public imagination. By 1915, the percentage of electric cars
on the road had plummeted. For the next 55 years, internal combustion
engines ruled the roads. Aside from some special-purpose vehicles,
electric cars were nowhere to be found. However, in the 1970s, 
the tide began to turn. US concerns about oil availability renewed
interest in alternative energy sources. And studies in the 1980s linking 
car emissions with smog in cities like Los Angeles encouraged governments 
and environmental organizations to reconsider electric vehicles. At this point, car companies had spent
decades investing in internal combustion engines 
without devoting any resources to solving the century-old 
battery problem. But other companies were developing
increasingly efficient batteries to power a new wave 
of portable electronics. By the 1990s, energy dense nickel metal
hydride batteries were on the market, soon followed by lithium-ion batteries. Alongside regulatory mandates 
by California to reduce smog, these innovations sparked a small wave
of new electric vehicles, including hybrid cars. Hybrids aren’t true electric vehicles; their nickel metal hydride batteries are only used to optimize 
the efficiency of gas-burning engines. But in 2008, Tesla Motors went further, grabbing the attention of consumers, 
automakers, and regulators with its lithium-ion-powered Roadster. This purely electric vehicle could travel 
more than 320 kilometers on a single charge, almost doubling the previous record. Since then, electric vehicles have 
vastly improved in cost, performance, efficiency, and availability. They can accelerate much faster
than gas-powered sports cars, and while some models still
have a high upfront cost, they reliably save their drivers money
in the long run. As governments around the world focus 
on slowing climate change, electric vehicles are now expected 
to replace gas-powered ones altogether. In Norway, 75% of car sales in 2020 
were plug-in electric vehicles. And policies such as California’s
Zero Emission Vehicle mandate and Europe’s aggressive 
CO2 emission standards have dramatically slowed investments 
in gas-powered vehicles worldwide. Soon, electric cars will reclaim 
their place on the road, putting gasoline in our rearview.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

**Transcript**:
If you were buying a car in 1899, you would’ve had three major
options to choose from. You could buy a steam-powered car. Typically relying on gas-powered boilers, 
these could drive as far as you wanted— provided you also wanted to lug
around extra water to refuel and didn’t mind waiting 30 minutes
for your engine to heat up. Alternatively, you could buy
a car powered by gasoline. However, the internal combustion engines
in these models required dangerous hand-cranking to start and emitted loud noises
and foul-smelling exhaust while driving. So your best bet was probably
option number three: a battery-powered electric vehicle. These cars were quick to start,
clean and quiet to run, and if you lived somewhere with access 
to electricity, easy to refuel overnight. If this seems like an easy choice,
you're not alone. By the end of the 19th century, 
nearly 40% of American cars were electric. In cities with early electric systems, battery-powered cars were 
a popular and reliable alternative to their occasionally explosive 
competitors. But electric vehicles had one

**Transcript**:
Mohammadpur has always had 
a unique relationship with the weather. Located at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, this coastal village was built 
on top of the Meghna River delta. Deltas are a kind of landmass formed 
when sediment carried by rivers is deposited where that river meets 
a larger body of water. River deltas are incredibly fertile
ecosystems capable of supporting abundant agriculture
and marine life. However, their borders gradually change
as rivers bring more sediment in and storms wash sediment away. The residents of Mohammadpur are well
accustomed to managing the ebbs and flows of this ever-shifting
landscape. But lately, an abundance of intense
cyclones have caused frequent flooding that impedes farming and fishing. These floods also erode the coastline, allowing later storms to wipe
away land altogether. Since 2000, the Meghna River has overtaken
the coastline by 2.5 kilometers, forcing many villagers to move inland
or to nearby cities. Mohammadpur isn’t the only place 
where erratic weather is impacting people’s mobility. Repeated typhoons in the Philippines have 
displaced thousands from their homes. In Fiji, the government is already moving
many coastal villages inland to get ahead of predicted land loss. And in the United States, melting permafrost is causing chunks
of the Alaskan coastline to erode. In some ways, this is nothing new. Humanity has always adapted
to changing weather and moved to regions that best support
cultural lifestyles and livelihoods. However, scientists agree 
that this rise in extreme weather is a by-product of Earth’s 
rapidly changing climate. Global warming increases the frequency and
intensity of storms, flooding and drought, while also melting polar ice caps 
and raising sea levels. These factors are changing the environment
much faster than they have in the past. Even for communities with the resources 
to take action, the variable pace and nature of these
changes makes them difficult to adapt to. And the vulnerable populations most
impacted by climate change are often those least responsible. Many facing climate mobility live 
in farming and fishing communities in countries that generate dramatically 
fewer emissions than their larger counterparts. Bangladesh is one such country. The nation has a unique combination
of low-lying geography and heavily populated coastal regions. Most of these vulnerable coastal families,
like those in Mohammadpur, don’t want to abandon 
their homes and livelihoods. And for others, leaving Bangladesh
isn’t financially practical. So to stay with their communities, many have moved a few meters inland and built more resilient homes
on higher ground or elevated stilts. Others have tried to buy land on newly
emerging islands in the delta, while some have sent family members
to find work in nearby cities. A handful of individuals might even cross
international borders, if they have family, friends, or work 
connections on the other side. But many of the residents who’ve left
are eager to return home. Unfortunately, it's unclear when
weather extremes will die down, and the government has repeatedly delayed
projects to build concrete embankments that would prevent further erosion. In other parts of the world, people couldn’t move inland 
even if they wanted to. The low-lying Pacific Island nations 
of Kiribati and Tuvalu are only 811 square kilometers
and 26 square kilometers, respectively; so migration would mean moving 
to a different country altogether. Instead, their governments and citizens
have united in physically, legally, and politically 
fortifying their countries. Island residents are planting
coastal mangrove forests, and building up low-lying areas of land
with dredged sand to shield themselves against storms 
and rising sea levels. And the islands’ governments have
repeatedly lobbied on the global stage for countries with the highest emissions 
to reduce pollution and take responsibility 
for climate change. The challenges facing
each coastal community are unique, and the diversity of the people's
experiences can make climate mobility a difficult phenomenon 
to measure and define. But as new communities are endangered
by extreme weather, it’s more important than ever
to listen to those on the front lines of this crisis.

isn’t financially practical. So to stay with their communities, many have moved a few meters inland and built more resilient homes
on higher ground or elevated stilts. Others have tried to buy land on newly
emerging islands in the delta, while some have sent family members
to find work in nearby cities. A handful of individuals might even cross
international borders, if they have family, friends, or work 
connections on the other side. But many of the residents who’ve left
are eager to return home. Unfortunately, it's unclear when
weather extremes will die down, and the government has repeatedly delayed
projects to build concrete embankments that would prevent further erosion. In other parts of the world, people couldn’t move inland 
even if they wanted to. The low-lying Pacific Island nations 
of Kiribati and Tuvalu are only 811 square kilometers
and 26 square kilometers, respectively; so migration would mean moving 
to a different country altogether. Instead, their governments and citizens
have united in physically, legally, and politically 
fortifying their countries. Island residents are planting
coastal mangrove forests, and building up low-lying areas of land
with dredged sand to shield themselves against storms 
and rising sea levels. And the islands’ governments have
repeatedly lobbied on the global stage for countries with the highest emissions 
to reduce pollution and take responsibility 
for climate change. The challenges facing
each coastal community are unique, and the diversity of the people's
experiences can make climate mobility a difficult phenomenon 
to measure and define. But as new communities are endangered
by extreme weather, it’s more important than ever
to listen to those on the front lines of this crisis.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the 20th century, most vaccines took
well over a decade to research, test, and produce. But the vaccines for COVID-19 cleared 
the threshold for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed 
is a medical technology that’s been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine. This new treatment uses our body’s 
existing cellular machinery to trigger an immune response, protecting us from viruses without
ever experiencing an infection. And in the future, this approach might
be able to treat new diseases almost as quickly as they emerge. So how do these 
revolutionary vaccines work? The key ingredient is in the name. mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid,
is a naturally occurring molecule that encodes the instructions 
for producing proteins. When our cells process mRNA, 
a part of the cell called the ribosome translates and follows these instructions
to build the encoded protein. The mRNA in these vaccines works
in exactly the same way, but scientists use the molecule to safely
introduce our body to a virus. First, researchers encode trillions 
of mRNA molecules with the instructions for a specific viral protein. This part of the virus is
harmless by itself, but helpful for training 
our body’s immune response. Then, they inject those molecules 
into a nanoparticle roughly 1,000 times smaller 
than the average cell. This nanoparticle is made of lipids, the same type of fatty material that forms
the membrane around our cells. But these lipids have been 
specially engineered to protect the mRNA on its journey 
through the body and assist its entry into the cell. Lastly, the final ingredients are added:
sugars and salt to help keep the nanoparticles intact 
until they reach their destination. Before use, the vaccine is kept at a 
temperature of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius to ensure none of the components
break down. Once injected, the nanoparticles
disperse and encounter cells. The lipid coating on each nanoparticle
fuses with the lipid membrane of a cell and releases the mRNA to do its work. At this point, we should note 
that while the vaccine is delivering viral genetic material into our cells, it’s impossible for this material 
to alter our DNA. mRNA is a short-lived molecule that would need additional enzymes and 
chemical signals to even access our DNA, let alone change it. And none of these DNA altering components
are present in mRNA vaccines. Once inside the cell, the ribosome
translates the mRNA’s instructions and begins assembling the viral protein. In COVID-19 vaccines, that protein 
is one of the spikes typically found on the virus’s surface. Without the rest of the virus 
this lone spike is not infectious, but it does trigger our immune response. Activating the immune system
can be taxing on the body, resulting in brief fatigue, fever, 
and muscle soreness in some people. But this doesn’t mean 
the recipient is sick— it means the vaccine is working. The body is producing antibodies to fight
that viral protein, that will then stick around to defend 
against future COVID-19 infections. And since this particular protein is
likely to be found in most COVID variants, these antibodies should reduce 
the threat of catching new strains. This approach offers significant
advantages over previous vaccines. Traditional vaccines contain 
weakened versions of live viruses or amputated sections of a virus, both of which required time intensive
research to prepare and unique chemical treatments
to safely inject. But mRNA vaccines don’t actually
contain any viral particles, so they don’t have to be built 
from scratch to safely adjust each virus. In fact, every mRNA vaccine could have
roughly the same list of ingredients. Imagine a reliable, robustly tested
vaccine that can treat any disease by swapping out a single component. To treat a new illness, researchers would 
identify the right viral protein, encode it into mRNA, and then swap that mRNA 
into the existing vaccine platform. This could make it possible to develop
new vaccines in weeks, giving humanity a flexible new tool 
in the never-ending fight against disease.

**Transcript**:
In the 20th century, most vaccines took
well over a decade to research, test, and produce. But the vaccines for COVID-19 cleared 
the threshold for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed 
is a medical technology that’s been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine. This new treatment uses our body’s 
existing cellular machinery to trigger an immune response, protecting us from viruses without
ever experiencing an infection. And in the future, this approach might
be able to treat new diseases almost as quickly as they emerge. So how do these 
revolutionary vaccines work? The key ingredient is in the name. mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid,
is a naturally occurring molecule that encodes the instructions 
for producing proteins. When our cells process mRNA, 
a part of the cell called the ribosome translates and follows these instructions
to build the encoded protein. The mRNA in these vaccines works
in exactly the same way, but scientists use the molecule to safely
introduce our body to a virus. First, researchers encode trillions 
of mRNA molecules with the instructions for a specific viral protein. This part of the virus is
harmless by itself, but helpful for training 
our body’s immune response. Then, they inject those molecules 
into a nanoparticle roughly 1,000 times smaller 
than the average cell. This nanoparticle is made of lipids, the same type of fatty material that forms
the membrane around our cells. But these lipids have been 
specially engineered to protect the mRNA on its journey 
through the body and assist its entry into the cell. Lastly, the final ingredients are added:
sugars and salt to help keep the nanoparticles intact 
until they reach their destination. Before use, the vaccine is kept at a 
temperature of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius to ensure none of the components
break down. Once injected, the nanoparticles
disperse and encounter cells. The lipid coating on each nanoparticle
fuses with the lipid membrane of a cell and releases the mRNA to do its work. At this point, we should note 
that while the vaccine is delivering viral genetic material into our cells, it’s impossible for this material 
to alter our DNA. mRNA is a short-lived molecule that would need additional enzymes and 
chemical signals to even access our DNA, let alone change it. And none of these DNA altering components
are present in mRNA vaccines. Once inside the cell, the ribosome
translates the mRNA’s instructions and begins assembling the viral protein. In COVID-19 vaccines, that protein 
is one of the spikes typically found on the virus’s surface. Without the rest of the virus 
this lone spike is not infectious, but it does trigger our immune response. Activating the immune system
can be taxing on the body, resulting in brief fatigue, fever, 
and muscle soreness in some people. But this doesn’t mean 
the recipient is sick— it means the vaccine is working. The body is producing antibodies to fight
that viral protein, that will then stick around to defend 
against future COVID-19 infections. And since this particular protein is
likely to be found in most COVID variants, these antibodies should reduce 
the threat of catching new strains. This approach offers significant
advantages over previous vaccines. Traditional vaccines contain 
weakened versions of live viruses or amputated sections of a virus, both of which required time intensive
research to prepare and unique chemical treatments
to safely inject. But mRNA vaccines don’t actually
contain any viral particles, so they don’t have to be built 
from scratch to safely adjust each virus. In fact, every mRNA vaccine could have
roughly the same list of ingredients. Imagine a reliable, robustly tested
vaccine that can treat any disease by swapping out a single component. To treat a new illness, researchers would 
identify the right viral protein, encode it into mRNA, and then swap that mRNA 
into the existing vaccine platform. This could make it possible to develop
new vaccines in weeks, giving humanity a flexible new tool 
in the never-ending fight against disease.

**Transcript**:
Straddling Virginia and North Carolina
is an area that was once described as the “most repulsive of American possessions.” By 1728, it was known 
as the Great Dismal Swamp. But while many deemed it uninhabitable, recent findings suggest that 
a hidden society persisted in the Swamp until the mid-1800′s. So, who lived there? 
And what happened to them? People long suspected that communities
had settled in the Swamp, but the historical record was spotty. It wasn’t until 2003 that the first
systematic archaeological foray finally launched. But, despite having been
extensively drained over the years, the wetland still presented
many practical challenges. Researchers had to penetrate
thorny thickets, wade through waters studded
with sinkholes, and braved the threats 
of dangerous animals. After several months, they finally found
islands in the Swamp’s interior. These formations quickly revealed
traces of centuries-old secrets. Archeologists found buried markings 
that appear to have been left by raised log cabins, fire pits, 
and basins that may have collected drinking water. They identified what seems 
to have been a palisade wall and excavated more than 3,000 artifacts, including weaponry, stone tools, and 
fragments of ceramic pipes and vessels. These discoveries, combined
with previous findings, helped tell a story that reaches
far back in time. Indigenous American people began regularly
inhabiting or visiting the area around 11,000 BCE, 
before it was even a swampland. A second era of occupation began
much later. In the early 1600′s, more 
Indigenous people came seeking refuge from colonization. And later that century,
it seems that Maroons— or people escaping from slavery—
began entering the area. In fact, the team’s findings
support the theory that the Great Dismal Swamp was home 
to the largest Maroon settlement in all of North America. Because their success and survival 
depended on staying hidden from the outside world, these Swamp communities were largely
self-sufficient. Based on primary sources, historians believe that people cultivated
grains and created homes, furniture, musical instruments, and more 
from the Swamp’s available resources. These organic materials had probably
already decomposed by the time archaeologists
came to investigate. But researchers were able to find 
more durable objects, like ceramic and stone items that were 
likely left by ancient Indigenous people then reused and modified 
by others later on. Around the turn of the 19th century,
It seems the relationship between the Swamp’s community 
and the outside world changed. Lumber and manufacturing companies began
encroaching on the Swamp’s interior. They brought thousands of free and
enslaved workers to live in the Swamp and made them harvest wood,
excavate canals, and drain fields. Certain findings suggest that the Swamp’s 
hidden communities might have switched to a more 
defensive mode during this period. But researchers also observed more 
mass-produced objects from this time, indicating that trading was taking place. Researchers think that the secret 
Swamp communities dispersed during or soon after 
the American Civil War, by the end of which slavery was abolished
in the United States. Some people may have stayed in the
Swamp until they passed away or left to settle elsewhere. Most of what we know about these hidden
communities has come to light after archeologists excavated sections
of a single island. However, there may have been hundreds
of habitable islands dotting the Swamp’s interior at the time. Between 1600 and 1860, many people lived 
in these hidden settlements. Some probably lived their entire lives
within the Swamp and never saw a white person 
or experienced racial persecution in broader American society. Generations of Black Maroons 
and Indigenous Americans resisted slavery and colonization 
by creating an independent society in the heart of the Great Dismal Swamp. They fostered a refuge in what might seem 
like the unlikeliest of places— but one that was more hospitable
than what lay outside. Today, this area offers a partial record
of that secret, self-reliant world, imagined and built for survival 
and the preservation of freedom.

**Transcript**:
Straddling Virginia and North Carolina
is an area that was once described as the “most repulsive of American possessions.” By 1728, it was known 
as the Great Dismal Swamp. But while many deemed it uninhabitable, recent findings suggest that 
a hidden society persisted in the Swamp until the mid-1800′s. So, who lived there? 
And what happened to them? People long suspected that communities
had settled in the Swamp, but the historical record was spotty. It wasn’t until 2003 that the first
systematic archaeological foray finally launched. But, despite having been
extensively drained over the years, the wetland still presented
many practical challenges. Researchers had to penetrate
thorny thickets, wade through waters studded
with sinkholes, and braved the threats 
of dangerous animals. After several months, they finally found
islands in the Swamp’s interior. These formations quickly revealed
traces of centuries-old secrets. Archeologists found buried markings 
that appear to have been left by raised log cabins, fire pits, 
and basins that may have collected drinking water. They identified what seems 
to have been a palisade wall and excavated more than 3,000 artifacts, including weaponry, stone tools, and 
fragments of ceramic pipes and vessels. These discoveries, combined
with previous findings, helped tell a story that reaches
far back in time. Indigenous American people began regularly
inhabiting or visiting the area around 11,000 BCE, 
before it was even a swampland. A second era of occupation began
much later. In the early 1600′s, more 
Indigenous people came seeking refuge from colonization. And later that century,
it seems that Maroons— or people escaping from slavery—
began entering the area. In fact, the team’s findings
support the theory that the Great Dismal Swamp was home 
to the largest Maroon settlement in all of North America. Because their success and survival 
depended on staying hidden from the outside world, these Swamp communities were largely
self-sufficient. Based on primary sources, historians believe that people cultivated
grains and created homes, furniture, musical instruments, and more 
from the Swamp’s available resources. These organic materials had probably
already decomposed by the time archaeologists
came to investigate. But researchers were able to find 
more durable objects, like ceramic and stone items that were 
likely left by ancient Indigenous people then reused and modified 
by others later on. Around the turn of the 19th century,
It seems the relationship between the Swamp’s community 
and the outside world changed. Lumber and manufacturing companies began
encroaching on the Swamp’s interior. They brought thousands of free and
enslaved workers to live in the Swamp and made them harvest wood,
excavate canals, and drain fields. Certain findings suggest that the Swamp’s 
hidden communities might have switched to a more 
defensive mode during this period. But researchers also observed more 
mass-produced objects from this time, indicating that trading was taking place. Researchers think that the secret 
Swamp communities dispersed during or soon after 
the American Civil War, by the end of which slavery was abolished
in the United States. Some people may have stayed in the
Swamp until they passed away or left to settle elsewhere. Most of what we know about these hidden
communities has come to light after archeologists excavated sections
of a single island. However, there may have been hundreds
of habitable islands dotting the Swamp’s interior at the time. Between 1600 and 1860, many people lived 
in these hidden settlements. Some probably lived their entire lives
within the Swamp and never saw a white person 
or experienced racial persecution in broader American society. Generations of Black Maroons 
and Indigenous Americans resisted slavery and colonization 
by creating an independent society in the heart of the Great Dismal Swamp. They fostered a refuge in what might seem 
like the unlikeliest of places— but one that was more hospitable
than what lay outside. Today, this area offers a partial record
of that secret, self-reliant world, imagined and built for survival 
and the preservation of freedom.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 8, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A samurai is found dead 
in a quiet bamboo grove. One by one, the crime’s only known 
witnesses recount their version of the events that transpired. But as they each tell their tale, it becomes clear that every testimony
is plausible, yet different. And each witness implicates themselves. This is the premise of “In a Grove,”
a short story published in the early 1920s by Japanese author Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. Though many know this tale of warring
perspectives by a different name: “Rashomon.” In 1950, Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa
adapted two of Akutagawa’s stories into one film. This movie introduced the world 
to an enduring cultural metaphor that has transformed our understanding 
of truth, justice and human memory. The Rashomon effect describes a situation in which individuals give significantly 
different but equally conceivable accounts of the same event. Often used to highlight the unreliability 
of eyewitnesses, the Rashomon effect usually occurs
under two specific conditions. The first: there’s no evidence 
to verify what really happened. And the second: there’s pressure
to achieve closure, often provided by an authority figure
trying to identify the definitive truth. But the Rashomon effect undermines the 
very idea of a singular, objective truth. In the source material, Akutagawa and Kurosawa use 
the tools of their media to give each character’s testimony
equal weight, transforming each witness 
into an unreliable narrator. Without any hints on who’s sharing 
the most accurate account, the audience can’t tell which
character to trust. Instead, each testimony takes
on a truthful quality, and the audience is left doubting 
their convictions as they guess who ended 
the samurai’s life. Some might find this frustrating because 
the plot subverts expectations of how mysteries usually end. But by refusing to provide a clear answer, these two artists capture the messiness
and complexity of truth and human memory. Neuroscientists have found 
that when we form a memory, our interpretation of visual information
is influenced by our previous experiences 
and internal biases. Some of these biases are unique 
to individuals, but others are more universal. For example, egocentric bias 
can influence people to subconsciously reshape their memories in ways that cast a positive light 
on their actions. Even if we were able to encode
a memory accurately, recalling it incorporates new information
that changes the memory. And when we later recall that event, we typically remember the embellished
memory instead of the original experience. These underlying psychological
phenomena mean that the Rashomon effect can pop up anywhere. In biology, scientists starting 
from the same dataset and applying the same analytical methods, 
frequently publish different results. Anthropologists regularly grapple with 
the impact personal backgrounds can have on an expert's perception. In one famous case, two anthropologists
visited the Mexican village of Tepoztlan. The first researcher described life 
in the town as happy and contented, while the second recorded residents
as paranoid and disgruntled. Experts aside, the Rashomon effect can
also impact the general public, particularly when it comes to the 
perception of complicated world events. For example, following a 2015
security summit between the United States 
and leaders from the Arab States, media reports about the summit
varied enormously. Some stated that it had gone smoothly,
while others called it a complete failure. It's tempting to fixate on why we
have competing perceptions, but perhaps the more important question 
the Rashomon effect raises is, what is truth anyway? Are there situations when 
an “objective truth” doesn’t exist? What can different versions 
of the same event tell us about the time, place and people involved? And how can we make group decisions 
if we’re all working with different information, backgrounds, 
and biases? Like most questions, 
these don’t have a definitive answer. But the enduring importance 
of Akutagawa’s story suggests there may be value 
in embracing the ambiguity.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What crime was committed in the short story and movie from which the Rashomon effect comes?

to individuals, but others are more universal. For example, egocentric bias 
can influence people to subconsciously reshape their memories in ways that cast a positive light 
on their actions. Even if we were able to encode
a memory accurately, recalling it incorporates new information
that changes the memory. And when we later recall that event, we typically remember the embellished
memory instead of the original experience. These underlying psychological
phenomena mean that the Rashomon effect can pop up anywhere. In biology, scientists starting 
from the same dataset and applying the same analytical methods, 
frequently publish different results. Anthropologists regularly grapple with 
the impact personal backgrounds can have on an expert's perception. In one famous case, two anthropologists
visited the Mexican village of Tepoztlan. The first researcher described life 
in the town as happy and contented, while the second recorded residents
as paranoid and disgruntled. Experts aside, the Rashomon effect can
also impact the general public, particularly when it comes to the 
perception of complicated world events. For example, following a 2015
security summit between the United States 
and leaders from the Arab States, media reports about the summit
varied enormously. Some stated that it had gone smoothly,
while others called it a complete failure. It's tempting to fixate on why we
have competing perceptions, but perhaps the more important question 
the Rashomon effect raises is, what is truth anyway? Are there situations when 
an “objective truth” doesn’t exist? What can different versions 
of the same event tell us about the time, place and people involved? And how can we make group decisions 
if we’re all working with different information, backgrounds,

these don’t have a definitive answer. But the enduring importance 
of Akutagawa’s story suggests there may be value 
in embracing the ambiguity.

**Transcript**:
A samurai is found dead 
in a quiet bamboo grove. One by one, the crime’s only known 
witnesses recount their version of the events that transpired. But as they each tell their tale, it becomes clear that every testimony
is plausible, yet different. And each witness implicates themselves. This is the premise of “In a Grove,”
a short story published in the early 1920s by Japanese author Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. Though many know this tale of warring
perspectives by a different name: “Rashomon.” In 1950, Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa
adapted two of Akutagawa’s stories into one film. This movie introduced the world 
to an enduring cultural metaphor that has transformed our understanding 
of truth, justice and human memory. The Rashomon effect describes a situation in which individuals give significantly 
different but equally conceivable accounts of the same event. Often used to highlight the unreliability 
of eyewitnesses, the Rashomon effect usually occurs
under two specific conditions. The first: there’s no evidence 
to verify what really happened. And the second: there’s pressure
to achieve closure, often provided by an authority figure
trying to identify the definitive truth. But the Rashomon effect undermines the 
very idea of a singular, objective truth. In the source material, Akutagawa and Kurosawa use 
the tools of their media to give each character’s testimony
equal weight, transforming each witness 
into an unreliable narrator. Without any hints on who’s sharing 
the most accurate account, the audience can’t tell which
character to trust. Instead, each testimony takes
on a truthful quality, and the audience is left doubting 
their convictions as they guess who ended 
the samurai’s life. Some might find this frustrating because 
the plot subverts expectations of how mysteries usually end. But by refusing to provide a clear answer, these two artists capture the messiness
and complexity of truth and human memory. Neuroscientists have found 
that when we form a memory, our interpretation of visual information
is influenced by our previous experiences 
and internal biases. Some of these biases are unique 
to individuals, but others are more universal. For example, egocentric bias 
can influence people to subconsciously reshape their memories in ways that cast a positive light

**Transcript**:
Many animals need sleep. Even brainless jellyfish enter 
sleep-like states where they pulse less and respond more slowly 
to food and movement. But all of the threats and demands 
animals face don’t just go away when it’s time to doze. That’s why a range of birds and mammals 
experience some degree of asymmetrical sleep where parts 
of their brain are asleep and other areas are more active. This is even true for humans. So how does it work? All vertebrate brains consist 
of two hemispheres: the right and left. Brain activity is usually similar 
across both during sleep. But during asymmetrical sleep, one brain hemisphere can be in deep sleep
while the other is in lighter sleep. And in an extreme version 
called “unihemispheric sleep,” one hemisphere may appear completely awake
while the other is in deep sleep. Take bottlenose dolphins. Their breathing is consciously controlled, and they must surface for air every 
few minutes or they’ll drown. When they have a newborn calf, they must
actually swim nonstop for weeks in order to keep it safe. So dolphins sleep unihemispherically,
with just one hemisphere at a time. This allows them to continue swimming
and breathing while snoozing. Other marine mammals also
need asymmetrical sleep. Fur seals might spend weeks on end 
migrating at sea. They slip into unihemispheric sleep
while floating horizontally, holding their nostrils above the surface,
closing their upward-facing eye, and keeping their
downward-facing eye open. This may help them stay alert
to threats from the depths. Similar pressures keep birds
partially awake. Mallard ducks sleep in groups, but some
must inevitably be on the peripheries. Those ducks spend more time 
in unihemispheric sleep, with their outward-facing eyes open and their corresponding
brain hemispheres more active. Other birds have been shown to catch z’s
in midair migration. While undertaking non-stop transoceanic 
flights of up to 10 days, frigatebirds either sleep with one
or both hemispheres at a time. They do so in seconds-long bursts,
usually while riding air currents. But the frigatebirds still sleep 
less than 8% of what they would on land, suggesting a great tolerance
for sleep deprivation. It’s currently unclear whether
asymmetrical sleep packs the same benefits as sleep 
in both hemispheres and how this varies across species. In one experiment, fur seals relied 
on asymmetrical sleep while being constantly stimulated. But in recovery, they showed 
a strong preference for sleep across both hemispheres, suggesting that it was more restorative 
for them. Dolphins, on the other hand, have been observed to maintain high levels
of alertness for at least five days. By switching which hemisphere is awake, they get several hours of deep sleep 
in each hemisphere throughout a 24-hour period. This may be why unihemispheric sleep alone
meets their needs. So, what about humans? Have you ever woken up groggy after
your first night in a new place? Part of your brain might’ve spent
the night only somewhat asleep. For decades, scientists have recognized
that participants sleep poorly their first night in the lab. It’s actually customary to toss
out that night’s data. In 2016, scientists discovered 
that this “first night effect” is a very subtle version 
of asymmetrical sleep in humans. They saw that, during the first night, participants experience deeper sleep
in their right hemisphere and lighter sleep in their left. When exposed to infrequent sounds, that lighter sleeping left hemisphere
showed greater bumps in activity. Participants also woke up and responded
to infrequent sounds faster during the first night than 
when experiencing deep sleep in both hemispheres 
during nights following. This suggests that, like other animals, humans use asymmetrical sleep
for vigilance, specifically in unfamiliar environments. So, while your hotel room is obviously
not trying to eat you and you’re not going to die 
if you don’t continue moving, your brain is still keeping you alert. Just in case.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 9, Ground Truth Question 3, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Many animals need sleep. Even brainless jellyfish enter 
sleep-like states where they pulse less and respond more slowly 
to food and movement. But all of the threats and demands 
animals face don’t just go away when it’s time to doze. That’s why a range of birds and mammals 
experience some degree of asymmetrical sleep where parts 
of their brain are asleep and other areas are more active. This is even true for humans. So how does it work? All vertebrate brains consist 
of two hemispheres: the right and left. Brain activity is usually similar 
across both during sleep. But during asymmetrical sleep, one brain hemisphere can be in deep sleep
while the other is in lighter sleep. And in an extreme version 
called “unihemispheric sleep,” one hemisphere may appear completely awake
while the other is in deep sleep. Take bottlenose dolphins. Their breathing is consciously controlled, and they must surface for air every 
few minutes or they’ll drown. When they have a newborn calf, they must
actually swim nonstop for weeks in order to keep it safe. So dolphins sleep unihemispherically,
with just one hemisphere at a time. This allows them to continue swimming
and breathing while snoozing. Other marine mammals also
need asymmetrical sleep. Fur seals might spend weeks on end 
migrating at sea. They slip into unihemispheric sleep
while floating horizontally, holding their nostrils above the surface,
closing their upward-facing eye, and keeping their
downward-facing eye open. This may help them stay alert
to threats from the depths. Similar pressures keep birds
partially awake. Mallard ducks sleep in groups, but some
must inevitably be on the peripheries. Those ducks spend more time 
in unihemispheric sleep, with their outward-facing eyes open and their corresponding
brain hemispheres more active. Other birds have been shown to catch z’s
in midair migration. While undertaking non-stop transoceanic 
flights of up to 10 days, frigatebirds either sleep with one
or both hemispheres at a time. They do so in seconds-long bursts,
usually while riding air currents. But the frigatebirds still sleep 
less than 8% of what they would on land, suggesting a great tolerance
for sleep deprivation. It’s currently unclear whether
asymmetrical sleep packs the same benefits as sleep 
in both hemispheres and how this varies across species. In one experiment, fur seals relied 
on asymmetrical sleep while being constantly stimulated. But in recovery, they showed 
a strong preference for sleep across both hemispheres, suggesting that it was more restorative 
for them. Dolphins, on the other hand, have been observed to maintain high levels
of alertness for at least five days. By switching which hemisphere is awake, they get several hours of deep sleep 
in each hemisphere throughout a 24-hour period. This may be why unihemispheric sleep alone
meets their needs. So, what about humans? Have you ever woken up groggy after
your first night in a new place? Part of your brain might’ve spent
the night only somewhat asleep. For decades, scientists have recognized
that participants sleep poorly their first night in the lab. It’s actually customary to toss
out that night’s data. In 2016, scientists discovered 
that this “first night effect” is a very subtle version 
of asymmetrical sleep in humans. They saw that, during the first night, participants experience deeper sleep
in their right hemisphere and lighter sleep in their left. When exposed to infrequent sounds, that lighter sleeping left hemisphere
showed greater bumps in activity. Participants also woke up and responded
to infrequent sounds faster during the first night than 
when experiencing deep sleep in both hemispheres 
during nights following. This suggests that, like other animals, humans use asymmetrical sleep
for vigilance, specifically in unfamiliar environments. So, while your hotel room is obviously
not trying to eat you and you’re not going to die 
if you don’t continue moving, your brain is still keeping you alert. Just in case.

must inevitably be on the peripheries. Those ducks spend more time 
in unihemispheric sleep, with their outward-facing eyes open and their corresponding
brain hemispheres more active. Other birds have been shown to catch z’s
in midair migration. While undertaking non-stop transoceanic 
flights of up to 10 days, frigatebirds either sleep with one
or both hemispheres at a time. They do so in seconds-long bursts,
usually while riding air currents. But the frigatebirds still sleep 
less than 8% of what they would on land, suggesting a great tolerance
for sleep deprivation. It’s currently unclear whether
asymmetrical sleep packs the same benefits as sleep 
in both hemispheres and how this varies across species. In one experiment, fur seals relied 
on asymmetrical sleep while being constantly stimulated. But in recovery, they showed 
a strong preference for sleep across both hemispheres, suggesting that it was more restorative 
for them. Dolphins, on the other hand, have been observed to maintain high levels
of alertness for at least five days. By switching which hemisphere is awake, they get several hours of deep sleep 
in each hemisphere throughout a 24-hour period. This may be why unihemispheric sleep alone
meets their needs. So, what about humans? Have you ever woken up groggy after
your first night in a new place? Part of your brain might’ve spent
the night only somewhat asleep. For decades, scientists have recognized
that participants sleep poorly their first night in the lab. It’s actually customary to toss
out that night’s data. In 2016, scientists discovered 
that this “first night effect” is a very subtle version 
of asymmetrical sleep in humans. They saw that, during the first night, participants experience deeper sleep
in their right hemisphere and lighter sleep in their left. When exposed to infrequent sounds, that lighter sleeping left hemisphere
showed greater bumps in activity. Participants also woke up and responded
to infrequent sounds faster during the first night than 
when experiencing deep sleep in both hemispheres 
during nights following. This suggests that, like other animals, humans use asymmetrical sleep
for vigilance, specifically in unfamiliar environments. So, while your hotel room is obviously
not trying to eat you and you’re not going to die 
if you don’t continue moving, your brain is still keeping you alert. Just in case.

**Transcript**:
Take a deep breath. In that single intake of air, your lungs swelled with roughly
25 sextillion molecules, ranging from compounds produced days ago, to those formed billions of years 
in the past. In fact, many of the molecules 
you’re breathing were likely exhaled by members 
of ancient civilizations and innumerable humans since. But what exactly are we all breathing? Roughly 78% of Earth’s atmosphere
is composed of nitrogen generated by volcanic activity 
deep beneath the planet’s crust. The next major ingredient is oxygen,
accounting for 21% of Earth’s air. While oxygen molecules have been around
as long as Earth’s oceans, oxygen gas didn’t appear until 
ocean dwelling microorganisms evolved to produce it. Finally, .93% of our air is argon, a molecule formed from the radioactive
decay of potassium in Earth’s atmosphere, crust, and core. Together, all these dry gases 
make up 99.93% of each breath you take. Depending on when and where you are,
the air may also contain some water vapor. But even more variable 
is that remaining .07%, which contains a world of possibilities. This small slice of air is composed
of numerous small particles including pollen, fungal spores, 
and liquid droplets, alongside trace gases
like methane and carbon dioxide. The specific cocktail of natural 
and man-made compounds changes dramatically from place to place. But no matter where you are, .07% of every breath you take 
likely contains man-made pollutants— potentially including toxic compounds 
that can cause lung disease, cancer, and even DNA damage. There’s a wide variety of known pollutants
but they all fall into two categories. The first are primary pollutants. These toxic compounds are directly emitted from a man-made 
or naturally occurring source. However, they don't always come
from the places you'd expect. Some large factories mostly generate 
water vapor, with only small quantities of pollutants 
mixed in. Conversely, burning wood or dung can 
create polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; dangerous compounds that have been 
linked to several types of cancer, as well as long-term DNA damage. In all cases, pollutants interact with
regional weather patterns and topography, which can keep compounds local 
or spread them kilometers away. When these molecules travel 
through the air, a transformation occurs. Natural compounds called oxidants,
formed by oxygen and sunlight, break down the pollutants. Sometimes, these reactions make pollutants
more easily washed out by rain. But in other cases, they result 
in even more toxic secondary pollutants. For example, when factories burn coal, they release high concentrations
of sulfur oxides. These molecules oxidize to form sulfates, which condense with water vapor in the air
to form a blanket of fine particles that impair visibility 
and cause severe lung damage. This so-called sulfurous smog was 
well-known in 20th century London and continues to plague cities 
like Beijing. Since the advent of cars, another secondary pollutant 
has taken center stage. Exhaust from fossil fuel-burning vehicles
releases nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons which react to form ozone. And while some ozone 
in the upper atmosphere helps shield us from ultraviolet rays,
on the ground, this gas can form alongside secondary
particles and create photochemical smog. This brown fog can be found covering
densely packed cities, making seeing difficult 
and breathing hazardous. It also contributes to climate change
by trapping heat in the atmosphere. In recent decades, industrial activity
has contributed to a huge spike in various trace gas emissions, fundamentally changing the air 
we all breathe. Many places have already responded
with countermeasures. Most cars produced since the 1980′s 
are equipped with catalytic converters that reduce the emission 
of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. And today, places like Beijing are
battling smog by electrifying 
their energy infrastructure and limiting automobile emissions 
altogether. But while moving away from fossil fuels 
is essential, there's no universal remedy
for air pollution. Different regions need to respond 
with unique regulations that account for their local pollutants. Because no matter where you live, 
we all share the same air.

**Transcript**:
They’ve passed every test, cleared every
hurdle, jumped through every hoop. Now, all that remains is to unleash 
them on the world. But wait— what’s this? Ah, yes, there’s one more challenge. 
They must now across the valley of death. All new products must pass through 
here before they reach the market. Many never make it out, 
and sometimes that’s OK— if they don’t work, don’t fill a need, 
or for any number of other reasons. But inventions that could help address
massive global issues also face this risk. That’s because a technology’s potential
isn’t the only factor that determines whether it will succeed. The valley of death is especially risky 
for innovations involving complex physical objects 
as opposed to software, and for those in highly regulated
industries, like medicine, building materials, 
and transportation. Regulations and other obstacles 
aren’t inherently bad— they’re often designed
to keep people safe— but they do tend to scare off investors, and that’s what traps good ideas 
in the valley of death: their funding dries up before 
they can become profitable. One of the fields where this problem 
is most pressing today is zero-carbon technologies. They’re essential to our future because they will help us eliminate 
greenhouse gas emissions and stabilize our climate. But they also have features that make 
them particularly vulnerable in the valley of death. Let’s look at why that is, 
and how we can change it. All new technologies must go 
through a development phase before they can become profitable. For zero-carbon technologies, the costs of this phase are high,
the timelines are long, and, in spite of the good they can do, demand is often low because they can 
require big changes in both infrastructure 
and consumer behavior. For example, electric heat pumps
don’t burn fossil fuels and, when you factor in savings on energy use, are cost-competitive with gas furnaces, but homeowners only change their heating
and cooling systems every few decades. Direct air capture technologies, 
meanwhile, remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere. We need these technologies 
to reach our emissions goals, and several of them have already
been proven to work, but they’re at risk of getting trapped 
in the valley of death because they're expensive. This creates a vicious cycle because 
the best way to lower costs is by, well, practicing: 
making more of a product and refining it. But high initial costs 
scare off investors, and without their money, companies can’t continue to develop 
their technologies— and can't ultimately decrease costs. Fortunately, there’s a way
to break this cycle: governments can help close the gap, when private investors won’t fund
technologies with such a high potential 
for social benefit. This isn’t just theoretical: in the 1990s, 
functioning solar panels existed, but weren’t widely adopted 
because of their cost. To change this, Germany offered government
loans to companies creating solar panels, and legally obligated utility companies to buy electricity produced 
using renewable energy. The U.S. and China followed suit 
by financing major solar panel projects. The cost of solar has dropped 
almost 90% since 2009, making it much easier to adopt. A similar thing happened for wind energy: during the oil crisis of the 1970s,
Denmark invested in wind power and started taxing winds’ 
fossil fuel-based competitors. Other countries took similar steps, and as more wind power was
generated worldwide, the costs of this technology
dropped dramatically. These success stories tell us 
that government initiatives work— initiatives like boosting spending 
on research and development, offering tax and loan incentives 
to startups that want to develop 
zero-carbon technologies and consumers who want to buy them,
and putting a price on carbon emissions. We need governments
to do what they did for solar and wind for many more innovations. At the end of the day, 
ideas and inventions alone can’t solve our most daunting problems— policies and markets have to be shaped so the most promising technologies
can succeed.

**Transcript**:
Satan, the beast crunching sinners’ bones
in his subterranean lair. Lucifer, the fallen angel raging 
against the established order. Mephistopheles, the trickster striking 
deals with unsuspecting humans. These three divergent devils are all based
on Satan of the Old Testament, an angelic member of God’s court 
who torments Job in the Book of Job. But unlike any of these literary devils, the Satan of the Bible was 
a relatively minor character, with scant information about his deeds 
or appearance. So how did he become the ultimate 
antagonist, with so many different forms? In the New Testament, 
Satan saw a little more action: tempting Jesus,
using demons to possess people, and finally appearing as a giant dragon 
who is cast into hell. This last image particularly inspired
medieval artists and writers, who depicted a scaled, shaggy-furred
creature with overgrown toenails. In Michael Pacher’s painting 
of St. Augustine and the Devil, the devil appears as an upright lizard— with a second miniature face 
glinting on his rear and. The epitome of these monster Satans appeared in Italian poet 
Dante Alighieri’s “Inferno.” Encased in the ninth circle of hell, Dante’s Satan is a three-headed,
bat-winged behemoth who feasts on sinners. But he’s also an object of pity: powerless as the panicked beating 
of his wings only encases him further in ice. The poem’s protagonist escapes from hell
by clambering over Satan’s body, and feels both disgust and sympathy
for the trapped beast— prompting the reader to consider
the pain of doing evil. By the Renaissance, the devil started
to assume a more human form. Artists painted him as a man 
with cloven hooves and curling horns inspired by Pan,
the Greek god of the wild. In his 1667 masterpiece “Paradise Lost,” English poet John Milton depicted
the devil as Lucifer, an angel who started a rebellion 
on the grounds that God is too powerful. Kicked out of heaven, 
this charismatic rebel becomes Satan, and declares that he’d rather rule in hell
than serve in heaven. Milton’s take inspired numerous depictions
of Lucifer as an ambiguous figure, rather than a purely evil one. Milton’s Lucifer later became an iconic
character for the Romantics of the 1800s, who saw him as a hero who defied higher
power in pursuit of essential truths, with tragic consequences. Meanwhile, in the German legend 
of Doctor Faust, which dates to the 16th century, we get a look at what happens 
when the devil comes to Earth. Faust, a dissatisfied scholar, pledges his soul to the devil
in exchange for bottomless pleasure. With the help 
of the devil’s messenger Mephistopheles, Faust quickly seizes 
women, power, and money— only to fall into the eternal fires 
of hell. Later versions of the story show
Mephistopheles in different lights. In Christopher Marlowe's account, a cynical Doctor Faustus is happy 
to strike a deal with Mephistopheles. In Johann Wolfgang van Goethe’s version, Mephistopheles tricks Faust
into a grisly deal. Today, a Faustian bargain refers 
to a trade that sacrifices integrity for short-term gains. In stagings of Goethe’s play, Mephistopheles appeared 
in red tights and cape. This version of the devil was often
played as a charming trickster— one that eventually paraded 
through comic books, advertising, and film in his red suit. These three takes on the devil 
are just the tip of the iceberg: the devil continues to stalk 
the public imagination to this day, tempting artists of all kinds 
to render him according to new and fantastical visions.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Satan, the beast crunching sinners’ bones
in his subterranean lair. Lucifer, the fallen angel raging 
against the established order. Mephistopheles, the trickster striking 
deals with unsuspecting humans. These three divergent devils are all based
on Satan of the Old Testament, an angelic member of God’s court 
who torments Job in the Book of Job. But unlike any of these literary devils, the Satan of the Bible was 
a relatively minor character, with scant information about his deeds 
or appearance. So how did he become the ultimate 
antagonist, with so many different forms? In the New Testament, 
Satan saw a little more action: tempting Jesus,
using demons to possess people, and finally appearing as a giant dragon 
who is cast into hell. This last image particularly inspired
medieval artists and writers, who depicted a scaled, shaggy-furred
creature with overgrown toenails. In Michael Pacher’s painting 
of St. Augustine and the Devil, the devil appears as an upright lizard— with a second miniature face 
glinting on his rear and. The epitome of these monster Satans appeared in Italian poet 
Dante Alighieri’s “Inferno.” Encased in the ninth circle of hell, Dante’s Satan is a three-headed,
bat-winged behemoth who feasts on sinners. But he’s also an object of pity: powerless as the panicked beating 
of his wings only encases him further in ice. The poem’s protagonist escapes from hell
by clambering over Satan’s body, and feels both disgust and sympathy
for the trapped beast— prompting the reader to consider
the pain of doing evil. By the Renaissance, the devil started
to assume a more human form. Artists painted him as a man 
with cloven hooves and curling horns inspired by Pan,
the Greek god of the wild. In his 1667 masterpiece “Paradise Lost,” English poet John Milton depicted
the devil as Lucifer, an angel who started a rebellion 
on the grounds that God is too powerful. Kicked out of heaven, 
this charismatic rebel becomes Satan, and declares that he’d rather rule in hell
than serve in heaven. Milton’s take inspired numerous depictions
of Lucifer as an ambiguous figure, rather than a purely evil one. Milton’s Lucifer later became an iconic
character for the Romantics of the 1800s, who saw him as a hero who defied higher
power in pursuit of essential truths, with tragic consequences. Meanwhile, in the German legend 
of Doctor Faust, which dates to the 16th century, we get a look at what happens 
when the devil comes to Earth. Faust, a dissatisfied scholar, pledges his soul to the devil
in exchange for bottomless pleasure. With the help 
of the devil’s messenger Mephistopheles, Faust quickly seizes 
women, power, and money— only to fall into the eternal fires 
of hell. Later versions of the story show
Mephistopheles in different lights. In Christopher Marlowe's account, a cynical Doctor Faustus is happy 
to strike a deal with Mephistopheles. In Johann Wolfgang van Goethe’s version, Mephistopheles tricks Faust
into a grisly deal. Today, a Faustian bargain refers 
to a trade that sacrifices integrity for short-term gains. In stagings of Goethe’s play, Mephistopheles appeared 
in red tights and cape. This version of the devil was often
played as a charming trickster— one that eventually paraded 
through comic books, advertising, and film in his red suit. These three takes on the devil 
are just the tip of the iceberg: the devil continues to stalk 
the public imagination to this day, tempting artists of all kinds 
to render him according to new and fantastical visions.

**Transcript**:
Fourteen Greenlands could fit in Africa, but you wouldn’t guess it
from most maps of the world. The fact is, every world map humans
have ever made is wrong. Actually, it’s impossible to make a map
of the world 100% right. No, not you, globe—
we know you’re accurate. Not you, Google Earth,
you’re just a digital globe. We're talking about flat maps, which,
let's face it, are way more convenient
for a lot of things. Anyway, as we were saying, it’s impossible to make a 100% accurate
flat map of a spherical planet. For a long time, people didn't even try. They just plonked places down in arbitrary
locations without any consistent scale. Then in 150 AD, the Greek mathematician
and astronomer Ptolemy systematically mapped the Earth on a grid and placed locations on the grid
according to coordinates, so maps could be checked against
others and replicated. Ptolemy built his grid out of lines
we still use today: 180 lines of latitude
and 360 lines of longitude. In spite of these advances,
people kept getting lost. Part of the problem was a— shall we say— incomplete understanding
of the world’s geography. But it was also just really difficult
to navigate using a map. Because the Earth is round, the shortest route from one place
to another is a path along a circle. If we draw this route on a flat map, it passes through every line of longitude
at a different angle. To follow the route,
you’d have to constantly shift the direction you're traveling. Any slight error would land
you in the wrong place. In 1569, Gerardus Mercator
fixed this problem. He created a world map proportioned so these curved navigational routes
would be straight, passing through every line
of longitude at the same angle and therefore allowing navigators
to set a constant bearing— in other words, travel in one direction—
for a whole journey. There was just one tiny hitch: to do this, he had to distort land masses
and bodies of water so those furthest
from the equator got larger and those closest
to the equator shrank. In spite of its inaccuracies, Mercator’s
map was very useful. In fact, it’s still widely used today,
including in online maps. But it’s still wrong! In 1925, the Goode Homolosine Projection
was created as— get this— an interrupted pseudo-cylindrical
equal area projection. What does that mean?
Not important. The point was to minimize
distortion for the entire world. The map can be land-oriented...
or ocean-oriented. Either way, the so-called orange peel map
isn’t very easy to read. The Dymaxion Projection by American
architect Buckminster Fuller in the 1940s is even better. Sorry,
did we say better? It’s not better if you want to understand
where things are in the world. It is better in the sense that there are
no visibly evident distortions of the land masses. Though if you wanted to know, say,
how far Brazil is from Nigeria, you won’t get any sense
of that from this map. The most accurate projection to date
is the AuthaGraph World Map designed by Japanese architect
Hajime Narukawa in 1999. The continents and oceans are almost
completely in proportion, and the map is rectangular,
just how we like it. Could this be the perfect map? Well... no. Since the Mercator works
for navigation and reads clearly, why bother with all these
whacky maps? Arno Peters argued that by enlarging
European and North American countries, the Mercator projection
gives white nations a sense of supremacy over non-white nations
closer to the equator. He adapted the Gall-Peters Projection,
which counteracts that particular problem, but the continents are still... stretched. Today, we rely on maps less and less
for navigation, but they still play a vital role
in education. Peters was definitely on to something: no matter what map we’re looking at, it’s a story told from the perspective
of the map’s creator that in turn shapes—perhaps unduly—
our perception of our world. Simple changes in map design, even changes that have nothing
to do with how we transfer a round Earth to a flat surface,
can completely shift our point of view.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Fourteen Greenlands could fit in Africa, but you wouldn’t guess it
from most maps of the world. The fact is, every world map humans
have ever made is wrong. Actually, it’s impossible to make a map
of the world 100% right. No, not you, globe—
we know you’re accurate. Not you, Google Earth,
you’re just a digital globe. We're talking about flat maps, which,
let's face it, are way more convenient
for a lot of things. Anyway, as we were saying, it’s impossible to make a 100% accurate
flat map of a spherical planet. For a long time, people didn't even try. They just plonked places down in arbitrary
locations without any consistent scale. Then in 150 AD, the Greek mathematician
and astronomer Ptolemy systematically mapped the Earth on a grid and placed locations on the grid
according to coordinates, so maps could be checked against
others and replicated. Ptolemy built his grid out of lines
we still use today: 180 lines of latitude
and 360 lines of longitude. In spite of these advances,
people kept getting lost. Part of the problem was a— shall we say— incomplete understanding
of the world’s geography. But it was also just really difficult
to navigate using a map. Because the Earth is round, the shortest route from one place
to another is a path along a circle. If we draw this route on a flat map, it passes through every line of longitude
at a different angle. To follow the route,
you’d have to constantly shift the direction you're traveling. Any slight error would land
you in the wrong place. In 1569, Gerardus Mercator
fixed this problem. He created a world map proportioned so these curved navigational routes
would be straight, passing through every line
of longitude at the same angle and therefore allowing navigators
to set a constant bearing— in other words, travel in one direction—
for a whole journey. There was just one tiny hitch: to do this, he had to distort land masses
and bodies of water so those furthest
from the equator got larger and those closest
to the equator shrank. In spite of its inaccuracies, Mercator’s
map was very useful. In fact, it’s still widely used today,
including in online maps. But it’s still wrong! In 1925, the Goode Homolosine Projection
was created as— get this— an interrupted pseudo-cylindrical
equal area projection. What does that mean?
Not important. The point was to minimize
distortion for the entire world. The map can be land-oriented...
or ocean-oriented. Either way, the so-called orange peel map
isn’t very easy to read. The Dymaxion Projection by American
architect Buckminster Fuller in the 1940s is even better. Sorry,
did we say better? It’s not better if you want to understand
where things are in the world. It is better in the sense that there are
no visibly evident distortions of the land masses. Though if you wanted to know, say,
how far Brazil is from Nigeria, you won’t get any sense
of that from this map. The most accurate projection to date
is the AuthaGraph World Map designed by Japanese architect
Hajime Narukawa in 1999. The continents and oceans are almost
completely in proportion, and the map is rectangular,
just how we like it. Could this be the perfect map? Well... no. Since the Mercator works
for navigation and reads clearly, why bother with all these
whacky maps? Arno Peters argued that by enlarging
European and North American countries, the Mercator projection
gives white nations a sense of supremacy over non-white nations
closer to the equator. He adapted the Gall-Peters Projection,
which counteracts that particular problem, but the continents are still... stretched. Today, we rely on maps less and less
for navigation, but they still play a vital role
in education. Peters was definitely on to something: no matter what map we’re looking at, it’s a story told from the perspective
of the map’s creator that in turn shapes—perhaps unduly—
our perception of our world. Simple changes in map design, even changes that have nothing
to do with how we transfer a round Earth to a flat surface,
can completely shift our point of view.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You flip a switch. Coal burns in a furnace,
which turns water into steam. That steam spins a turbine,
which activates a generator, which pushes electrons
through the wire. This current propagates through hundreds
of miles of electric cables and arrives at your home. All around the world, countless people 
are doing this every second— flipping a switch, plugging in, 
pressing an “on” button. So how much electricity 
does humanity need? The amount we collectively use
is changing fast, so to answer this question, we need to know not just how much 
the world uses today, but how much we’ll use in the future. The first step is understanding
how we measure electricity. It’s a little bit tricky. A joule is a unit of energy, but we usually don't measure
electricity in just joules. Instead, we measure it in watts. Watts tell us how much energy, 
per second, it takes to power something. One joule per second
equals one watt. It takes about .1 watts
to power a smart phone, a thousand to power your house,
a million for a small town, and a billion for a mid-size city. As of 2020, it takes 3 trillion watts
to power the entire world. But almost a billion people don’t have
access to reliable electricity. As countries become more industrialized
and more people join the grid, electricity demand is expected 
to increase about 80% by 2050. That number isn't the complete picture. We'll also have to use electricity
in completely new ways. Right now, we power a lot of things
by burning fossil fuels, emitting an unsustainable amount 
of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. We’ll have to eliminate 
these emissions entirely to ensure a sustainable future 
for humanity. The first step to doing so,
for many industries, is to switch from fossil fuels 
to electric power. We'll need to electrify cars, switch buildings heated by natural gas
furnaces to electric heat pumps, and electrify the huge amount of heat
used in industrial processes. So all told, global electricity needs
could triple by 2050. We’ll also need all that electricity 
to come from clean energy sources if it’s going to solve the problems 
caused by fossil fuels. Today, only one third of the electricity
we generate comes from clean sources. Fossil fuels are cheap and convenient, 
easy to ship, and easy to turn into electricity 
on demand. So how can we close the gap? Wind and solar power work great
for places with lots of wind and sunshine, but we can’t store and ship sunlight 
or wind the way we can transport oil. To make full use of energy from these 
sources at other times or in other places, we’d have to store it in batteries and improve our power grid infrastructure
to transport it long distances. Meanwhile, nuclear power plants 
use nuclear fission to generate carbon-free electricity. Though still more expensive
than plants that burn fossil fuels, they can be built anywhere and don’t depend on intermittent 
energy sources like the sun or wind. Researchers are currently working 
to improve nuclear waste disposal and the safety of nuclear plants. There’s another possibility we’ve been 
trying to crack since the 1940s: nuclear fusion. It involves smashing light atoms together,
so they fuse, and harnessing the energy this releases. Accidents aren't a concern
with nuclear fusion, and it doesn't produce the long-lived
radioactive waste fission does. It also doesn’t have 
the transport concerns associated with wind, solar, 
and other renewable energy sources. A major breakthrough here could
revolutionize clean energy. The same is true of nuclear fission, 
solar, and wind. Breakthroughs in any 
of these technologies, and especially in all of them together,
can change the world: not only helping us triple 
our electricity supply, but enabling us to sustain it.

which turns water into steam. That steam spins a turbine,
which activates a generator, which pushes electrons
through the wire. This current propagates through hundreds
of miles of electric cables and arrives at your home. All around the world, countless people 
are doing this every second— flipping a switch, plugging in, 
pressing an “on” button. So how much electricity 
does humanity need? The amount we collectively use
is changing fast, so to answer this question, we need to know not just how much 
the world uses today, but how much we’ll use in the future. The first step is understanding
how we measure electricity. It’s a little bit tricky. A joule is a unit of energy, but we usually don't measure
electricity in just joules. Instead, we measure it in watts. Watts tell us how much energy, 
per second, it takes to power something. One joule per second
equals one watt. It takes about .1 watts
to power a smart phone, a thousand to power your house,
a million for a small town, and a billion for a mid-size city. As of 2020, it takes 3 trillion watts
to power the entire world. But almost a billion people don’t have
access to reliable electricity. As countries become more industrialized
and more people join the grid, electricity demand is expected 
to increase about 80% by 2050. That number isn't the complete picture. We'll also have to use electricity
in completely new ways. Right now, we power a lot of things
by burning fossil fuels, emitting an unsustainable amount 
of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. We’ll have to eliminate 
these emissions entirely to ensure a sustainable future 
for humanity. The first step to doing so,
for many industries, is to switch from fossil fuels 
to electric power. We'll need to electrify cars, switch buildings heated by natural gas
furnaces to electric heat pumps, and electrify the huge amount of heat
used in industrial processes. So all told, global electricity needs
could triple by 2050. We’ll also need all that electricity 
to come from clean energy sources if it’s going to solve the problems 
caused by fossil fuels. Today, only one third of the electricity
we generate comes from clean sources. Fossil fuels are cheap and convenient, 
easy to ship, and easy to turn into electricity 
on demand. So how can we close the gap? Wind and solar power work great
for places with lots of wind and sunshine, but we can’t store and ship sunlight 
or wind the way we can transport oil. To make full use of energy from these 
sources at other times or in other places, we’d have to store it in batteries and improve our power grid infrastructure
to transport it long distances. Meanwhile, nuclear power plants 
use nuclear fission to generate carbon-free electricity. Though still more expensive
than plants that burn fossil fuels, they can be built anywhere and don’t depend on intermittent 
energy sources like the sun or wind. Researchers are currently working 
to improve nuclear waste disposal and the safety of nuclear plants. There’s another possibility we’ve been 
trying to crack since the 1940s: nuclear fusion. It involves smashing light atoms together,
so they fuse, and harnessing the energy this releases. Accidents aren't a concern
with nuclear fusion, and it doesn't produce the long-lived
radioactive waste fission does. It also doesn’t have 
the transport concerns associated with wind, solar, 
and other renewable energy sources. A major breakthrough here could
revolutionize clean energy. The same is true of nuclear fission, 
solar, and wind. Breakthroughs in any 
of these technologies, and especially in all of them together,
can change the world: not only helping us triple 
our electricity supply, but enabling us to sustain it.

**Transcript**:
When I was a teen, I had terrible periods. I had crippling cramps, I leaked blood onto my clothes
and onto my bed sheets, and I had period diarrhea. And I had to miss school
one to two days a month, and I remember sitting on the couch
with my heating pads, thinking, "What's up with this?" When I ate food, I didn't leak saliva
from my salivary glands. When I went for a walk, I didn't leak fluid from my knees, 
"joint fluid." Why was menstruation so different? I wanted answers to these questions but there was no one for me to ask. My mother knew nothing about menstruation except that it was dirty and shameful
and I shouldn't talk about it. I asked girlfriends and everybody spoke in euphemisms. And finally, when I got the courage
to go to the doctor and talk about my heavy periods, I was told to eat liver. (Laughter) And when I went to the drug store
to buy my menstrual products, my 48-pack of super maxi pads, back in the day when they were the size
of a tissue box, each pad -- (Laughter) You know what I'm talking about. You have no idea how far
absorbent technology has come. (Laughter) I used to have to buy
my menstrual products in the feminine hygiene aisle. And I remember standing there, thinking, "Well, why don't I buy toilet paper
in the anal hygiene aisle?" (Laughter) Like, what's up with that? Why can't we talk about periods? And it's not about the blood,
as Freud would have you say, because if it were, there would be an ear, nose
and throat surgeon up here right now, talking about the taboos
of nose bleeds, right? And it's not even about periods, because otherwise, when we got rid
of our toxic, shameful periods when we became menopausal, we'd be elevated
to a higher social status. (Laughter) (Applause) It's just a patriarchal society is
invested in oppressing women, and at different points in our lives,
different things are used. And menstruation is used during what we in medicine call
the reproductive years. It's been around since
pretty much the beginning of time, many cultures thought
that women could spoil crops or milk, or wilt flowers. And then when religion came along, purity myths only made that worse. And medicine wasn't any help. In the 1920s and '30s there was the idea that women elaborated
something called a menotoxin. We could wilt flowers just by walking by. (Laughter) And that's what happens
when there's no diversity, right. Because there was no woman
to put her hand up and go, "Well, actually, that doesn't happen." And when you can't talk
about what's happening to your body, how do you break these myths? Because you don't even need to be a doctor to say that periods aren't toxic. If they were, why would an embryo
implant in a toxic swill? And if we all had this secret menotoxin, we could be laying waste
to crops and spoiling milk. (Laughter) Why would we have not used
our X-Women powers to get the vote sooner? (Laughter) (Applause) Even now, when I tweet about period diarrhea, as one does, (Laughter) I mention that it affects
28 percent of women. And every single time,
someone approaches me and says, "I thought I was the only one." That's how effective
that culture of shame is, that women can't even share
their experiences. So I began to think, "Well, what if everybody knew
about periods like a gynecologist? Wouldn't that be great?" Then you would all know what I know, you'd know that menstruation is a pretty unique
phenomenon among mammals. Most mammals have estrus. Humans, some primates, some bats, the elephant shrew
and the spiny mouse menstruate. And with menstruation what happens is
the brain triggers the ovary to start producing an egg. Estrogen is released and it starts to build up
the lining of the uterus, cell upon cell, like bricks. And what happens if you build
a brick wall too high without mortar? Well, it's unstable. So what happens when you ovulate? You release a hormone called progesterone, which is progestational,
it gets the uterus ready. It acts like a mortar
and it holds those bricks together. It also causes some changes to make the lining more hospitable
for implantation. If there's no pregnancy, (Whoosh) lining comes out, there's bleeding from the blood vessels
and that's the period. And I always find this point
really interesting. Because with estrus, the final signaling to get
the lining of the uterus ready actually comes from the embryo. But with menstruation, that choice comes from the ovary. It's as if choice is coded in
to our reproductive tracts. (Cheering and applause) OK, so now we know why the blood is there. And it's a pretty significant amount. It's 30 to 90 milliliters of blood, which is one to three ounces, and it can be more, and I know it seems like it's more
a lot of the times. I know. So why do we have so much blood? And why doesn't it just stay there
till the next cycle, right? Like, you didn't get pregnant,
so why can't it hang around? Well imagine if each month it got thicker
and thicker and thicker, right, like, imagine what tsunami
period that would be. (Laughter) We can't reabsorb it,
because it's too much. And it's too much because we need
a thick uterine lining for a very specific reason. Pregnancy exerts a significant
biological toll on our bodies. There is maternal mortality, there is the toll of breastfeeding and there is the toll of raising a child
until it is independent. And evolution -- (Laughter) That goes on longer
for some of us than others. (Laughter) But evolution knows
about risk-benefit ratio. And so evolution wants to maximize
the chance of a beneficial outcome. And how do you maximize the chance
of a beneficial outcome? You try to get the highest
quality embryos. And how do you get
the highest quality embryos? You make them work for it. You give them an obstacle course. So over the millennia
that we have evolved, it's been a little bit
like an arms race in the uterus, the lining getting thicker
and thicker and thicker, and the embryo getting more invasive until we reach this détente with the lining
of the uterus that we have. So we have this thick uterine lining and now it's got to come out, and how do you stop bleeding? Well, you stop a nose bleed
by pinching it, if you cut your leg,
you put pressure on it. We stop bleeding with pressure. When we menstruate, the lining of the uterus
releases substances that are made into chemicals
called prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators. And they make the uterus cramp down, they make it squeeze
on those blood vessels to stop the bleeding. They might also change
blood flow to the uterus and also cause inflammation
and that makes pain worse. And so you say, "OK,
how much pressure is generated?" And from studies
where some incredible women have volunteered
to have pressure catheters put in their uterus that they wear
their whole menstrual cycle -- God bless them, because
we wouldn't have this knowledge without, and it's very important knowledge, because the pressure
that's generated in the uterus during menstruation is 120 millimeters of mercury. "Well what's that," you say. Well, it's the amount of pressure
that's generated during the second stage of labor
when you're pushing. (Audience gasps) Right. Which, for those of you
who haven't had an unmedicated delivery, that's what it's like
when the blood pressure cuff is not quite as tight as it was
at the beginning, but it's still pretty tight, and you wish it would stop. So that kind of makes it different, right? If you start thinking
about the pain of menstruation, we wouldn't say
if someone needed to miss school because they were in the second stage
of labor and pushing, we wouldn't call them weak. We'd be like, "Oh my God,
you made it that far," right? (Laughter) And we wouldn't deny pain control to women who have
typical pain of labor, right? So it's important for us to call this pain
"typical" instead of "normal," because when we say it's normal,
it's easier to dismiss. As opposed to saying it's typical,
and we should address it. And we do have some ways
to address menstrual pain. One way is with something
called a TENS unit, which you can wear under your clothes and it sends an electrical impulse
to the nerves and muscles and no one really knows how it works, but we think it might be
the gate theory of pain, which is counterirritation. It's the same reason why,
if you hurt yourself, you rub it. Vibration travels faster
to your brain than pain does. We also have medications called nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory medications. And what they do is they block
the release of prostaglandins. They can reduce menstrual pain
for 80 percent of women. They also reduce the volume of blood
by 30 to 40 percent and they can help with period diarrhea. And we also have hormonal contraception, which gives us a thinner
lining of the uterus, so there's less prostaglandins produced and with less blood,
there's less need for cramping. Now, if those treatments fail you -- and it's important to use
that word choice, because we never fail the treatment, the treatment fails us. If that treatment fails you, you could be amongst the people who have a resistance
to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. We don't quite understand, but there are some complex mechanisms why those medications
just don't work for some women. It's also possible that you could have another reason for painful periods. You could have a condition
called endometriosis, where the lining of the uterus
is growing in the pelvic cavity, causing inflammation
and scar tissue and adhesions. And there may be other mechanisms
we don't quite understand yet, because it's a possibility
that pain thresholds could be different due to very complex biological mechanisms. But we're only going to find that out
by talking about it. It shouldn't be an act of feminism to know how your body works. It shouldn't -- (Applause) It shouldn't be an act of feminism to ask for help when you're suffering. The era of menstrual taboos is over. (Cheers and applause) The only curse here is the ability to convince
half the population that the very biological machinery
that perpetuates the species, that gives everything that we have, is somehow dirty or toxic. And I'm not going to stand for it. (Applause) And the way we break that curse? It's knowledge. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
When I was a teen, I had terrible periods. I had crippling cramps, I leaked blood onto my clothes
and onto my bed sheets, and I had period diarrhea. And I had to miss school
one to two days a month, and I remember sitting on the couch
with my heating pads, thinking, "What's up with this?" When I ate food, I didn't leak saliva
from my salivary glands. When I went for a walk, I didn't leak fluid from my knees, 
"joint fluid." Why was menstruation so different? I wanted answers to these questions but there was no one for me to ask. My mother knew nothing about menstruation except that it was dirty and shameful
and I shouldn't talk about it. I asked girlfriends and everybody spoke in euphemisms. And finally, when I got the courage
to go to the doctor and talk about my heavy periods, I was told to eat liver. (Laughter) And when I went to the drug store
to buy my menstrual products, my 48-pack of super maxi pads, back in the day when they were the size
of a tissue box, each pad -- (Laughter) You know what I'm talking about. You have no idea how far
absorbent technology has come. (Laughter) I used to have to buy
my menstrual products in the feminine hygiene aisle. And I remember standing there, thinking, "Well, why don't I buy toilet paper
in the anal hygiene aisle?" (Laughter) Like, what's up with that? Why can't we talk about periods? And it's not about the blood,
as Freud would have you say, because if it were, there would be an ear, nose
and throat surgeon up here right now, talking about the taboos
of nose bleeds, right? And it's not even about periods, because otherwise, when we got rid
of our toxic, shameful periods when we became menopausal, we'd be elevated
to a higher social status. (Laughter) (Applause) It's just a patriarchal society is
invested in oppressing women, and at different points in our lives,
different things are used. And menstruation is used during what we in medicine call
the reproductive years. It's been around since
pretty much the beginning of time, many cultures thought
that women could spoil crops or milk, or wilt flowers. And then when religion came along, purity myths only made that worse. And medicine wasn't any help. In the 1920s and '30s there was the idea that women elaborated
something called a menotoxin. We could wilt flowers just by walking by. (Laughter) And that's what happens
when there's no diversity, right. Because there was no woman
to put her hand up and go, "Well, actually, that doesn't happen." And when you can't talk
about what's happening to your body, how do you break these myths? Because you don't even need to be a doctor to say that periods aren't toxic. If they were, why would an embryo
implant in a toxic swill? And if we all had this secret menotoxin, we could be laying waste
to crops and spoiling milk. (Laughter) Why would we have not used
our X-Women powers to get the vote sooner? (Laughter) (Applause) Even now, when I tweet about period diarrhea, as one does, (Laughter) I mention that it affects
28 percent of women. And every single time,
someone approaches me and says, "I thought I was the only one." That's how effective
that culture of shame is, that women can't even share
their experiences. So I began to think, "Well, what if everybody knew
about periods like a gynecologist? Wouldn't that be great?" Then you would all know what I know, you'd know that menstruation is a pretty unique
phenomenon among mammals. Most mammals have estrus. Humans, some primates, some bats, the elephant shrew
and the spiny mouse menstruate. And with menstruation what happens is
the brain triggers the ovary to start producing an egg. Estrogen is released and it starts to build up
the lining of the uterus, cell upon cell, like bricks. And what happens if you build
a brick wall too high without mortar? Well, it's unstable. So what happens when you ovulate? You release a hormone called progesterone, which is progestational,
it gets the uterus ready. It acts like a mortar
and it holds those bricks together. It also causes some changes to make the lining more hospitable
for implantation. If there's no pregnancy, (Whoosh) lining comes out, there's bleeding from the blood vessels
and that's the period. And I always find this point
really interesting. Because with estrus, the final signaling to get
the lining of the uterus ready actually comes from the embryo. But with menstruation, that choice comes from the ovary. It's as if choice is coded in
to our reproductive tracts. (Cheering and applause) OK, so now we know why the blood is there. And it's a pretty significant amount. It's 30 to 90 milliliters of blood, which is one to three ounces, and it can be more, and I know it seems like it's more
a lot of the times. I know. So why do we have so much blood? And why doesn't it just stay there
till the next cycle, right? Like, you didn't get pregnant,
so why can't it hang around? Well imagine if each month it got thicker
and thicker and thicker, right, like, imagine what tsunami
period that would be. (Laughter) We can't reabsorb it,
because it's too much. And it's too much because we need
a thick uterine lining for a very specific reason. Pregnancy exerts a significant
biological toll on our bodies. There is maternal mortality, there is the toll of breastfeeding and there is the toll of raising a child
until it is independent. And evolution -- (Laughter) That goes on longer
for some of us than others. (Laughter) But evolution knows
about risk-benefit ratio. And so evolution wants to maximize
the chance of a beneficial outcome. And how do you maximize the chance
of a beneficial outcome? You try to get the highest
quality embryos. And how do you get
the highest quality embryos? You make them work for it. You give them an obstacle course. So over the millennia
that we have evolved, it's been a little bit
like an arms race in the uterus, the lining getting thicker
and thicker and thicker, and the embryo getting more invasive until we reach this détente with the lining
of the uterus that we have. So we have this thick uterine lining and now it's got to come out, and how do you stop bleeding? Well, you stop a nose bleed
by pinching it, if you cut your leg,
you put pressure on it. We stop bleeding with pressure. When we menstruate, the lining of the uterus
releases substances that are made into chemicals
called prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators. And they make the uterus cramp down, they make it squeeze
on those blood vessels to stop the bleeding. They might also change
blood flow to the uterus and also cause inflammation
and that makes pain worse. And so you say, "OK,
how much pressure is generated?" And from studies
where some incredible women have volunteered
to have pressure catheters put in their uterus that they wear
their whole menstrual cycle -- God bless them, because
we wouldn't have this knowledge without, and it's very important knowledge, because the pressure
that's generated in the uterus during menstruation is 120 millimeters of mercury. "Well what's that," you say. Well, it's the amount of pressure
that's generated during the second stage of labor
when you're pushing. (Audience gasps) Right. Which, for those of you
who haven't had an unmedicated delivery, that's what it's like
when the blood pressure cuff is not quite as tight as it was
at the beginning, but it's still pretty tight, and you wish it would stop. So that kind of makes it different, right? If you start thinking
about the pain of menstruation, we wouldn't say
if someone needed to miss school because they were in the second stage
of labor and pushing, we wouldn't call them weak. We'd be like, "Oh my God,
you made it that far," right? (Laughter) And we wouldn't deny pain control to women who have
typical pain of labor, right? So it's important for us to call this pain
"typical" instead of "normal," because when we say it's normal,
it's easier to dismiss. As opposed to saying it's typical,
and we should address it. And we do have some ways
to address menstrual pain. One way is with something
called a TENS unit, which you can wear under your clothes and it sends an electrical impulse
to the nerves and muscles and no one really knows how it works, but we think it might be
the gate theory of pain, which is counterirritation. It's the same reason why,
if you hurt yourself, you rub it. Vibration travels faster
to your brain than pain does. We also have medications called nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory medications. And what they do is they block
the release of prostaglandins. They can reduce menstrual pain
for 80 percent of women. They also reduce the volume of blood
by 30 to 40 percent and they can help with period diarrhea. And we also have hormonal contraception, which gives us a thinner
lining of the uterus, so there's less prostaglandins produced and with less blood,
there's less need for cramping. Now, if those treatments fail you -- and it's important to use
that word choice, because we never fail the treatment, the treatment fails us. If that treatment fails you, you could be amongst the people who have a resistance
to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. We don't quite understand, but there are some complex mechanisms why those medications
just don't work for some women. It's also possible that you could have another reason for painful periods. You could have a condition
called endometriosis, where the lining of the uterus
is growing in the pelvic cavity, causing inflammation
and scar tissue and adhesions. And there may be other mechanisms
we don't quite understand yet, because it's a possibility
that pain thresholds could be different due to very complex biological mechanisms. But we're only going to find that out
by talking about it. It shouldn't be an act of feminism to know how your body works. It shouldn't -- (Applause) It shouldn't be an act of feminism to ask for help when you're suffering. The era of menstrual taboos is over. (Cheers and applause) The only curse here is the ability to convince
half the population that the very biological machinery
that perpetuates the species, that gives everything that we have, is somehow dirty or toxic. And I'm not going to stand for it. (Applause) And the way we break that curse? It's knowledge. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Thousands of years ago,
the Romans invented a material that allowed them to build 
much of their sprawling civilization. Pliny the Elder praised an imposing
sea wall made from the stuff as “impregnable to the waves
and every day stronger.” He was right: much of this construction
still stands, having survived millennia of battering 
by environmental forces that would topple modern buildings. Today, our roads, sidewalks, bridges, 
and skyscrapers are made of a similar, though 
less durable, material called concrete. There’s three tons of it for every person 
on Earth. And over the next 40 years, 
we’ll use enough of it to build the equivalent of New York City 
every single month. Concrete has shaped our skylines, but that's not the only way
it's changed our world. It’s also played a surprisingly large role
in rising global temperatures over the last century, a trend that has already 
changed the world, and threatens to even more drastically
in the coming decades. To be fair to concrete, basically
everything humanity does contributes to the greenhouse gas 
emissions that cause global warming. Most of those emissions come 
from industrial processes we often aren’t aware of, 
but touch every aspect of our lives. Look around your home. Refrigeration— 
along with other heating and cooling— makes up about 6% of total emissions. Agriculture, which produces our food,
accounts for 18%. Electricity is responsible for 27%. Walk outside, and the cars zipping past,
planes overhead, trains ferrying commuters to work— transportation, including shipping, contributes 16% 
of greenhouse gas emissions. Even before we use any of these things,
making them produces emissions— a lot of emissions. Making materials— concrete, steel, plastic, glass, 
aluminum and everything else— accounts for 31%
of greenhouse gas emissions. Concrete alone is responsible for 8% 
of all carbon emissions worldwide. And it’s much more difficult to reduce 
the emissions from concrete than from other building materials. The problem is cement, 
one of the four ingredients in concrete. It holds the other three ingredients—
gravel, sand, and water— together. Unfortunately, it's impossible to make
cement without generating carbon dioxide. The essential ingredient in cement
is calcium oxide, CaO. We get that calcium oxide from limestone, which is mostly made of calcium carbonate:
CaCO3. We extract CaO from CaCO3
by heating limestone. What’s left is CO2— carbon dioxide. So for every ton of cement we produce,
we release one ton of carbon dioxide. As tricky as this problem is, it means concrete could help
us change the world a third time: by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions
and stabilizing our climate. Right now, there’s no 100% clean concrete, but there are some great ideas
to help us get there. Cement manufacturing also produces
greenhouse gas emissions by burning fossil fuels 
to heat the limestone. Heating the limestone with clean 
electricity or alternative fuels instead would eliminate those emissions. For the carbon dioxide from
the limestone itself, our best bet is carbon capture: specifically, capturing the carbon
right where it’s produced, before it enters the atmosphere. Devices that do this already exist, but they aren’t widely used because
there’s no economic incentive. Transporting and then storing 
the captured carbon can be expensive. To solve these problems, one company has found a way to store
captured CO2 permanently in the concrete itself. Other innovators are tinkering with 
the fundamental chemistry of concrete. Some are investigating ways 
to reduce emissions by decreasing the cement in concrete. Still others have been working
to uncover and replicate the secrets of Roman concrete. They found that Pliny’s remark 
is literally true. The Romans used volcanic ash 
in their cement. When the ash interacted with seawater,
the seawater strengthened it— making their concrete stronger and more 
long-lasting than any we use today. By adding these findings to an arsenal 
of modern innovations, hopefully we can replicate their success— both by making long lasting structures, and ensuring our descendants can admire
them thousands of years from now.

planes overhead, trains ferrying commuters to work— transportation, including shipping, contributes 16% 
of greenhouse gas emissions. Even before we use any of these things,
making them produces emissions— a lot of emissions. Making materials— concrete, steel, plastic, glass, 
aluminum and everything else— accounts for 31%
of greenhouse gas emissions. Concrete alone is responsible for 8% 
of all carbon emissions worldwide. And it’s much more difficult to reduce 
the emissions from concrete than from other building materials. The problem is cement, 
one of the four ingredients in concrete. It holds the other three ingredients—
gravel, sand, and water— together. Unfortunately, it's impossible to make
cement without generating carbon dioxide. The essential ingredient in cement
is calcium oxide, CaO. We get that calcium oxide from limestone, which is mostly made of calcium carbonate:
CaCO3. We extract CaO from CaCO3
by heating limestone. What’s left is CO2— carbon dioxide. So for every ton of cement we produce,
we release one ton of carbon dioxide. As tricky as this problem is, it means concrete could help
us change the world a third time: by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions
and stabilizing our climate. Right now, there’s no 100% clean concrete, but there are some great ideas
to help us get there. Cement manufacturing also produces
greenhouse gas emissions by burning fossil fuels 
to heat the limestone. Heating the limestone with clean 
electricity or alternative fuels instead would eliminate those emissions. For the carbon dioxide from
the limestone itself, our best bet is carbon capture: specifically, capturing the carbon
right where it’s produced, before it enters the atmosphere. Devices that do this already exist, but they aren’t widely used because
there’s no economic incentive. Transporting and then storing 
the captured carbon can be expensive. To solve these problems, one company has found a way to store
captured CO2 permanently in the concrete itself. Other innovators are tinkering with 
the fundamental chemistry of concrete. Some are investigating ways 
to reduce emissions by decreasing the cement in concrete. Still others have been working
to uncover and replicate the secrets of Roman concrete. They found that Pliny’s remark 
is literally true. The Romans used volcanic ash 
in their cement. When the ash interacted with seawater,
the seawater strengthened it— making their concrete stronger and more 
long-lasting than any we use today. By adding these findings to an arsenal 
of modern innovations, hopefully we can replicate their success— both by making long lasting structures, and ensuring our descendants can admire
them thousands of years from now.

**Transcript**:
Thousands of years ago,
the Romans invented a material that allowed them to build 
much of their sprawling civilization. Pliny the Elder praised an imposing
sea wall made from the stuff as “impregnable to the waves
and every day stronger.” He was right: much of this construction
still stands, having survived millennia of battering 
by environmental forces that would topple modern buildings. Today, our roads, sidewalks, bridges, 
and skyscrapers are made of a similar, though 
less durable, material called concrete. There’s three tons of it for every person 
on Earth. And over the next 40 years, 
we’ll use enough of it to build the equivalent of New York City 
every single month. Concrete has shaped our skylines, but that's not the only way
it's changed our world. It’s also played a surprisingly large role
in rising global temperatures over the last century, a trend that has already 
changed the world, and threatens to even more drastically
in the coming decades. To be fair to concrete, basically
everything humanity does contributes to the greenhouse gas 
emissions that cause global warming. Most of those emissions come 
from industrial processes we often aren’t aware of, 
but touch every aspect of our lives. Look around your home. Refrigeration— 
along with other heating and cooling— makes up about 6% of total emissions. Agriculture, which produces our food,

**Transcript**:
As of 2020, the world’s biggest 
lithium-ion battery is hooked up to the Southern California 
power grid and can provide 250 million watts 
of power, or enough to power about 250,000 homes. But it’s actually not the biggest battery
in the world: these lakes are. Wait— how can a pair of lakes 
be a battery? To answer that question, 
it helps to define a battery: it’s simply something that stores energy
and releases it on demand. The lithium-ion batteries that power 
our phones, laptops, and cars are just one type. They store energy in lithium ions. To release the energy, the ions 
are separated from their electrons, then rejoined at the other end 
of the battery as a new molecule with lower energy. How do the two lakes 
store and release energy? First, one is 300 meters higher 
than the other. Electricity powers pumps that move
billions of liters of water from the lower lake to the higher one. This stores the energy by giving the water
extra gravitational potential energy. Then, when there’s high demand
for electricity, valves open, releasing the stored energy 
by letting water flow downhill to power 6 giant turbines that can 
generate 3 billion watts of power for 10 hours. We’re going to need more and more 
giant batteries. That’s because right now, generating
enough electricity to power the world produces an unsustainable amount 
of greenhouse gas: 14 billion tons per year. We’ll need to get that number 
down to net-zero. But many clean energy sources 
can’t produce electricity 24/7. So to make the switch, we need a way to
store the electricity until it's needed. That means we need grid-scale batteries: batteries big enough 
to power multiple cities. Unfortunately, neither of the giant
batteries we’ve talked about so far can solve this problem. The two lakes setup requires specific
geography, takes up a lot of land, and has high upfront costs to build. The giant lithium-ion battery
in California, meanwhile, can power about 250,000 homes, yes,
but only for an hour. Lithium-ion batteries are great for things
that don’t use a lot of power. But to store a lot of energy, 
they have to be huge and heavy. That’s why electric planes aren’t a thing: the best electric plane 
can only carry two people for about 1,000 kilometers on one charge, or its batteries would be too heavy 
to fly. A typical commercial jet can carry 
300 people over 14,000 km before refueling. Lithium-ion batteries also require 
certain heavy metals to make. These resources are limited, and mining
them often causes environmental damage. Inventors all over the world are rising 
to the challenge of making batteries that can meet 
our needs— many of them even weirder 
than the two lakes. One company is building 
a skyscraper battery. When the sun is shining, 
a crane powered by solar energy piles blocks on top of each other 
in a tower. At night, the cranes let gravity
pull the blocks down and use the resulting power 
to spin generators. Though there have been
some early setbacks, another promising approach involves
heating up salts until they melt. The molten salt can be stored until 
there’s a high demand for electricity, then used to boil water. The steam can power turbines
that generate electricity. Another idea: bio-batteries made 
from paper, powered by bacteria, and activated by spit. Bacteria release energy in the form 
of electrons when they metabolize glucose, and at least one species of bacteria can
transfer those electrons outside its cells,
completing a circuit. While these batteries won’t power
a city, or even a house, they don't have the waste and cost
concerns of traditional batteries. From vast mountain lakes 
to microscopic bacteria, from seawater batteries
that bypass the need for heavy metals to nuclear batteries
that power deep space missions, we're constantly rethinking
what a battery can be. The next unlikely battery could
be hiding in plain sight— just waiting to be discovered 
and help us achieve a sustainable future.

**Transcript**:
As of 2020, the world’s biggest 
lithium-ion battery is hooked up to the Southern California 
power grid and can provide 250 million watts 
of power, or enough to power about 250,000 homes. But it’s actually not the biggest battery
in the world: these lakes are. Wait— how can a pair of lakes 
be a battery? To answer that question, 
it helps to define a battery: it’s simply something that stores energy
and releases it on demand. The lithium-ion batteries that power 
our phones, laptops, and cars are just one type. They store energy in lithium ions. To release the energy, the ions 
are separated from their electrons, then rejoined at the other end 
of the battery as a new molecule with lower energy. How do the two lakes 
store and release energy? First, one is 300 meters higher 
than the other. Electricity powers pumps that move
billions of liters of water from the lower lake to the higher one. This stores the energy by giving the water
extra gravitational potential energy. Then, when there’s high demand
for electricity, valves open, releasing the stored energy 
by letting water flow downhill to power 6 giant turbines that can 
generate 3 billion watts of power for 10 hours. We’re going to need more and more 
giant batteries. That’s because right now, generating
enough electricity to power the world produces an unsustainable amount 
of greenhouse gas: 14 billion tons per year. We’ll need to get that number 
down to net-zero. But many clean energy sources 
can’t produce electricity 24/7. So to make the switch, we need a way to
store the electricity until it's needed. That means we need grid-scale batteries: batteries big enough 
to power multiple cities. Unfortunately, neither of the giant
batteries we’ve talked about so far can solve this problem. The two lakes setup requires specific
geography, takes up a lot of land, and has high upfront costs to build. The giant lithium-ion battery
in California, meanwhile, can power about 250,000 homes, yes,
but only for an hour. Lithium-ion batteries are great for things
that don’t use a lot of power. But to store a lot of energy, 
they have to be huge and heavy. That’s why electric planes aren’t a thing: the best electric plane 
can only carry two people for about 1,000 kilometers on one charge, or its batteries would be too heavy 
to fly. A typical commercial jet can carry 
300 people over 14,000 km before refueling. Lithium-ion batteries also require 
certain heavy metals to make. These resources are limited, and mining
them often causes environmental damage. Inventors all over the world are rising 
to the challenge of making batteries that can meet 
our needs— many of them even weirder 
than the two lakes. One company is building 
a skyscraper battery. When the sun is shining, 
a crane powered by solar energy piles blocks on top of each other 
in a tower. At night, the cranes let gravity
pull the blocks down and use the resulting power 
to spin generators. Though there have been
some early setbacks, another promising approach involves
heating up salts until they melt. The molten salt can be stored until 
there’s a high demand for electricity, then used to boil water. The steam can power turbines
that generate electricity. Another idea: bio-batteries made 
from paper, powered by bacteria, and activated by spit. Bacteria release energy in the form 
of electrons when they metabolize glucose, and at least one species of bacteria can
transfer those electrons outside its cells,
completing a circuit. While these batteries won’t power
a city, or even a house, they don't have the waste and cost
concerns of traditional batteries. From vast mountain lakes 
to microscopic bacteria, from seawater batteries
that bypass the need for heavy metals to nuclear batteries
that power deep space missions, we're constantly rethinking

be hiding in plain sight— just waiting to be discovered 
and help us achieve a sustainable future.

**Transcript**:
Two frogs are minding their own business
in the swamp when WHAM— they’re kidnapped. They come to in a kitchen, 
captives of a menacing chef. He boils up a pot of water 
and lobs one of the frogs in. But it’s having none of this. The second its toes hit the scalding water
it jumps right out the window. The chef refills the pot, but this time 
he doesn’t turn on the heat. He plops the second frog in,
and this frog’s okay with that. The chef turns the heat on, very low, 
and the temperature of water slowly rises. So slowly that the frog doesn’t notice. In fact, it basks in the balmy water. Only when the surface begins to bubble
does the frog realize: it’s toast. What’s funny about this parable is that
it’s not scientifically true... for frogs. In reality, a frog will detect slowly
heating water and leap to safety. Humans, on the other hand,
are a different story. We’re perfectly happy to sit in the pot 
and slowly turn up the heat, all the while insisting it isn’t our hand
on the dial, arguing about whether we can 
trust thermometers, and questioning— 
even if they’re right, does it matter? It does. Since 1850, global average temperatures 
have risen by 1 degree Celsius. That may not sound like a lot, but it is. Why? 1 degree is an average. Many places have already gotten
much warmer than that. Some places in the Arctic 
have already warmed 4 degrees. If global average temperatures 
increase 1 more degree, the coldest nights in the Arctic
might get 10 degrees warmer. The warmest days in Mumbai 
might get 5 degrees hotter. So how did we get here? Almost everything that makes modern life
possible relies on fossil fuels: coal, oil, and gas full of carbon 
from ancient organic matter. When we burn fossil fuels, we release carbon dioxide 
that builds up in our atmosphere, where it remains for hundreds 
or even thousands of years, letting heat in, but not out. The heat comes from sunlight, which passes
through the atmosphere to Earth, where it gets absorbed 
and warms everything up. Warm objects emit infrared radiation,
which should pass back out into space, because most atmospheric gases 
don’t absorb it. But greenhouse gases—
carbon dioxide and methane— do absorb infrared wavelengths. So when we add more of those gases 
to the atmosphere, less heat makes it back out to space, 
and our planet warms up. If we keep emitting greenhouse gases 
at our current pace, scientists predict temperatures
will rise 4 degrees from their pre-industrial levels by 2100. They’ve identified 1.5 degrees of warming— global averages half a degree warmer 
than today’s— as a threshold beyond which 
the negative impacts of climate change will become increasingly severe. To keep from crossing that threshold, we need to get our greenhouse gas 
emissions down to zero as fast as possible. Or rather, we have to get emissions
down to what's called net zero, meaning we may still be putting some
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but we take out as much as we put in. This doesn’t mean we can just keep 
emitting and sequester all that carbon— we couldn’t keep up with our emissions 
through natural methods, and technological solutions would
be prohibitively expensive and require huge amounts
of permanent storage. Instead, while we switch 
from coal, oil, and natural gas to clean energy and fuels, 
which will take time, we can mitigate the damage by removing
carbon from the atmosphere. Jumping out of the proverbial pot 
isn’t an option, but we can do something the frogs can’t: reach over, and turn down the heat.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Two frogs are minding their own business
in the swamp when WHAM— they’re kidnapped. They come to in a kitchen, 
captives of a menacing chef. He boils up a pot of water 
and lobs one of the frogs in. But it’s having none of this. The second its toes hit the scalding water
it jumps right out the window. The chef refills the pot, but this time 
he doesn’t turn on the heat. He plops the second frog in,
and this frog’s okay with that. The chef turns the heat on, very low, 
and the temperature of water slowly rises. So slowly that the frog doesn’t notice. In fact, it basks in the balmy water. Only when the surface begins to bubble
does the frog realize: it’s toast. What’s funny about this parable is that
it’s not scientifically true... for frogs. In reality, a frog will detect slowly
heating water and leap to safety. Humans, on the other hand,
are a different story. We’re perfectly happy to sit in the pot 
and slowly turn up the heat, all the while insisting it isn’t our hand
on the dial, arguing about whether we can 
trust thermometers, and questioning— 
even if they’re right, does it matter? It does. Since 1850, global average temperatures 
have risen by 1 degree Celsius. That may not sound like a lot, but it is. Why? 1 degree is an average. Many places have already gotten
much warmer than that. Some places in the Arctic 
have already warmed 4 degrees. If global average temperatures 
increase 1 more degree, the coldest nights in the Arctic
might get 10 degrees warmer. The warmest days in Mumbai 
might get 5 degrees hotter. So how did we get here? Almost everything that makes modern life
possible relies on fossil fuels: coal, oil, and gas full of carbon 
from ancient organic matter. When we burn fossil fuels, we release carbon dioxide 
that builds up in our atmosphere, where it remains for hundreds 
or even thousands of years, letting heat in, but not out. The heat comes from sunlight, which passes
through the atmosphere to Earth, where it gets absorbed 
and warms everything up. Warm objects emit infrared radiation,
which should pass back out into space, because most atmospheric gases 
don’t absorb it. But greenhouse gases—
carbon dioxide and methane— do absorb infrared wavelengths. So when we add more of those gases 
to the atmosphere, less heat makes it back out to space, 
and our planet warms up. If we keep emitting greenhouse gases 
at our current pace, scientists predict temperatures
will rise 4 degrees from their pre-industrial levels by 2100. They’ve identified 1.5 degrees of warming— global averages half a degree warmer 
than today’s— as a threshold beyond which 
the negative impacts of climate change will become increasingly severe. To keep from crossing that threshold, we need to get our greenhouse gas 
emissions down to zero as fast as possible. Or rather, we have to get emissions
down to what's called net zero, meaning we may still be putting some
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but we take out as much as we put in. This doesn’t mean we can just keep 
emitting and sequester all that carbon— we couldn’t keep up with our emissions 
through natural methods, and technological solutions would
be prohibitively expensive and require huge amounts
of permanent storage. Instead, while we switch 
from coal, oil, and natural gas to clean energy and fuels, 
which will take time, we can mitigate the damage by removing
carbon from the atmosphere. Jumping out of the proverbial pot 
isn’t an option, but we can do something the frogs can’t: reach over, and turn down the heat.
