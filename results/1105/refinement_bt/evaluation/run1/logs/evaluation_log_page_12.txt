**Transcript**:
There are more than one and a half billion
people out there using the internet every day, and just like you, they're looking for
answers. We here at SciShow are looking for answers
too, answers to questions about science and nature and the human body, Earth and the universe! So we're working with Google and YouTube to
answer ten of the most popular questions searched for on the internet. This is the World's Most Asked Questions! [Intro] Today’s question is: How can I get rid of
hiccups? People have all kinds of hiccup remedies that
they swear by, none of which seem to have much to do with each other -- like, swallowing
a teaspoon of sugar, or guzzling a glass of water, or just holding your breath. But to figure out how to get rid of hiccups
-- and why we get them in the first place -- you gotta start with getting to know your
diaphragm. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle under your
lungs that is one of the most important muscles you have, if you enjoy things like breathing. And a hiccup is just an involuntary spasm
of the diaphragm that causes it to contract suddenly. When that happens, you take in a gulp of air
really quickly, until your vocal folds -- the membranes at the top of your throat -- clamp
shut. That’s what causes the “hic” sound. Most of the time, the spasm stops as quickly
as it started, and you can just say “excuse me” and get on with your life. But sometimes, those spasms won’t stop ... which
means it’s time to get your diaphragm to relax. To do this, you basically gotta hit the reset
button on your nervous system -- or at least the part that controls your diaphragm. You can do that in a couple of different ways. One is to stimulate your vagus nerve -- that's
a nerve that runs down your neck from the base of your brain, and it regulates some
of your body’s most important functions, including your heartbeat and your breathing. Basically, you need to stimulate this nerve
-- distract it, if you will -- so it’ll stop constantly zapping your diaphragm. So, some people have luck getting rid of hiccups
by swallowing a teaspoon of sugar. Sounds delicious, but it’s harder than it
sounds. The act of gulping down those dry granules
can provide just enough confusing stimulus for your vagus nerve to start focusing on
your throat, and leave your diaphragm alone. Another more common approach to kicking the
hiccups is to increase the level of carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. That might seem a little weird, but your natural
breathing rhythms are regulated by your CO2 levels, and if they get too high, your nervous
system will signal your diaphragm and lungs to make sure they’re doing their job. And this is what’s behind most of the hiccup-busting
techniques you’ve probably heard of -- like holding your breath, or breathing into a paper
bag, or drinking a tall glass of water. All of that stuff stops your intake of oxygen
and ramps up your internal CO2 concentration, which signals your diaphragm to get its head
in the game and fix things. If the human body weren't so weird, it wouldn't
be so fascinating. And speaking of hiccup cures, of those of
you who filled out our SciShow Survey, 54% said that holding your breath was your preferred
method for relieving hiccups, while at a close second was drinking water, at 37%. We're loving answering these questions, but
of all the questions in the world, what do YOU most want answered? Let us know on Facebook or Twitter or in the
comments down below, and we will answer the best questions in a new video at the end of
the month. Don’t forget to use the hashtag #WMAQ, for

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: Why do hiccups sometimes stop on their own, but other times require intervention? Options: A. Because of the diaphragm's natural contractions, B. Because of the vagus nerve's constant stimulation, C. Because the body needs to reset its nervous system, D. Because of the body's natural reflexes to regulate breathing Correct Option: C**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks how to stop hiccups and has options related to resetting the nervous system or relaxing the diaphragm.

A closer match is not available in the provided generated MCQs, but if I had to choose one, I would suggest **Question 7** as the most similar, with the understanding that it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

If I were to modify the generated MCQs to create a better match, I would suggest rephrasing **Question 7** to directly ask about stopping hiccups and revising the options to better align with the ground truth MCQ.

**Modified Question 7: How do we stop hiccups? Options: A. We have to stimulate our diaphragm more, B. We have to hit the reset button on our nervous system and get our diaphragm to relax, C. We have to regulate our breathing patterns, D. We can't stop hiccups, they stop themselves Correct Option: B**

This modified question would be a better match for the ground truth MCQ. However, since I am limited to selecting from the original generated MCQs, I will stick with **Question 7** as the most similar, despite its limitations.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **7**

lungs that is one of the most important muscles you have, if you enjoy things like breathing. And a hiccup is just an involuntary spasm
of the diaphragm that causes it to contract suddenly. When that happens, you take in a gulp of air
really quickly, until your vocal folds -- the membranes at the top of your throat -- clamp
shut. That’s what causes the “hic” sound. Most of the time, the spasm stops as quickly
as it started, and you can just say “excuse me” and get on with your life. But sometimes, those spasms won’t stop ... which
means it’s time to get your diaphragm to relax. To do this, you basically gotta hit the reset
button on your nervous system -- or at least the part that controls your diaphragm. You can do that in a couple of different ways. One is to stimulate your vagus nerve -- that's
a nerve that runs down your neck from the base of your brain, and it regulates some
of your body’s most important functions, including your heartbeat and your breathing. Basically, you need to stimulate this nerve
-- distract it, if you will -- so it’ll stop constantly zapping your diaphragm. So, some people have luck getting rid of hiccups
by swallowing a teaspoon of sugar. Sounds delicious, but it’s harder than it
sounds. The act of gulping down those dry granules
can provide just enough confusing stimulus for your vagus nerve to start focusing on
your throat, and leave your diaphragm alone. Another more common approach to kicking the
hiccups is to increase the level of carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. That might seem a little weird, but your natural
breathing rhythms are regulated by your CO2 levels, and if they get too high, your nervous
system will signal your diaphragm and lungs to make sure they’re doing their job. And this is what’s behind most of the hiccup-busting
techniques you’ve probably heard of -- like holding your breath, or breathing into a paper
bag, or drinking a tall glass of water. All of that stuff stops your intake of oxygen
and ramps up your internal CO2 concentration, which signals your diaphragm to get its head
in the game and fix things. If the human body weren't so weird, it wouldn't
be so fascinating. And speaking of hiccup cures, of those of
you who filled out our SciShow Survey, 54% said that holding your breath was your preferred
method for relieving hiccups, while at a close second was drinking water, at 37%. We're loving answering these questions, but

**Transcript**:
[Music] Hey there, engineer buddies! I just want to thank you so much
for helping out in the last episode. I needed to get my phone out of the storm
drain, and together, we designed a solution. Our robot was just one of many possible solutions, and maybe you had an even better idea at home. If you did, please send it my way.
I'd love to check it out! But I've got a whole new challenge for you. Have you ever just wanted
some space to yourself? A place to relax, do your own thing,
eat Nutella straight off your fingers, and burp with abandon? Yeah, I need that.
That is a thing I need. You know what can help? I bet you already guessed it! Engineering. So how do we use the engineering
process to solve this problem? [Music] Well, first, we've got to define the problem. I need a place that is secluded and quiet. I need it to provide privacy
and a sense of my-ownness. Sounds pretty great, right? What about a big box to use as my space? It's secluded and it can be all my own. Solution-wise, it's a start, but a small one. We need to consider more options. What if I made adjustments to a
space I already have: my room? I could hang blankets from the ceiling
to help block out sounds from outside, and then I could also sing my
head off to T Swift if I wanted to without bothering the rest of my family. To top things off, I could add
a "Do Not Enter" sign to my door. Like, a serious sign. 
Bold font, all caps. Respect my sign! Okay, we've got two options. What else? What if instead of adjusting a space
I already have, I create a new space? There's a word for what we're
talking about here: architecture. Maybe we could become not just engineers,
but architects: engineers who design buildings. Even though the title of the job is a little
different, the process is still the same. So before doing architecture, we've got to weigh our options and choose
the best design to take into trials. Let's think about the box idea first. It's probably too small. I'd either be squished or
be half hanging out of it. Okay, how about tricking out my room? Again, while I'd feel like I have a sense
of privacy, I'd know that at any point, any one of my family members could bust in, and the blankets on the walls 
would muffle some of the sound, but wouldn't totally block them out. But hey, here's an idea:
what about a tree house? It would be totally my own, it would be far enough from my house that any weird burps or loud renditions
of "Shake It Off" wouldn't bug my family. Of course, it would take some
work. Some architecture work. So architect, activate!  [Music] Let's build the treehouse! It'll have a drop-down rope ladder that
I can pull up for optimal privacy, and it'll have windows so I can spot
when someone's on the way over and properly prepare myself. I can even use the blanket wall idea from
my second proposal to muffle the sound. Of course, I'll need space for lounging
and reading and dancing around, but before we start building,
you know what we've got to do? Build the prototype and test it. And in order to conduct useful trials,
we need to isolate the variables. What are the variables of
this particular mission? The size of the treehouse we choose
and the weight of the treehouse are really important variables
because we gotta make sure the treehouse can stay in the tree. What about variables when it comes
to soundproofing the thing? The number and the size of the
blankets that I use would be one, and so would be the amount of noise
I plan on making inside the treehouse. And we have to keep in
mind failure points, too. Like, the tree might be able to support
little old me in a small wooden tree house, but if I have a friend or two over,
the load might be too heavy. That would be a serious failure point. As for keeping things nice and quiet,
maybe my thickest heaviest blankets can block a soft rendition
of "You Belong With Me," but they might fail when I belt out
"Shake It Off" or have a burping contest. You've gotta test these things! So we'll keep working with the variables
until we've got a working design. Then, it's time to build. [Music] Architects use the same process,
the engineering process, when planning buildings from
skyscrapers to small family homes. I came up with what I think
will be a great treehouse, but as always, there can be lots
of different successful solutions. So here's your challenge: can you come
up with your own architecture solution? What would your building look like? How would it meet the success
criteria and navigate the variables? Let us know! [Music]

I can pull up for optimal privacy, and it'll have windows so I can spot
when someone's on the way over and properly prepare myself. I can even use the blanket wall idea from
my second proposal to muffle the sound. Of course, I'll need space for lounging
and reading and dancing around, but before we start building,
you know what we've got to do? Build the prototype and test it. And in order to conduct useful trials,
we need to isolate the variables. What are the variables of
this particular mission? The size of the treehouse we choose
and the weight of the treehouse are really important variables
because we gotta make sure the treehouse can stay in the tree. What about variables when it comes
to soundproofing the thing? The number and the size of the
blankets that I use would be one, and so would be the amount of noise
I plan on making inside the treehouse. And we have to keep in
mind failure points, too. Like, the tree might be able to support
little old me in a small wooden tree house, but if I have a friend or two over,
the load might be too heavy. That would be a serious failure point. As for keeping things nice and quiet,
maybe my thickest heaviest blankets can block a soft rendition
of "You Belong With Me," but they might fail when I belt out
"Shake It Off" or have a burping contest. You've gotta test these things! So we'll keep working with the variables
until we've got a working design. Then, it's time to build. [Music] Architects use the same process,
the engineering process, when planning buildings from
skyscrapers to small family homes. I came up with what I think
will be a great treehouse, but as always, there can be lots
of different successful solutions. So here's your challenge: can you come
up with your own architecture solution? What would your building look like? How would it meet the success
criteria and navigate the variables? Let us know! [Music]

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

However, the question intent is not an exact match. Question 5 asks about the variables that are important to consider when designing the treehouse, while the ground truth MCQ asks why it is important to look at the size of the tree and the weight of the treehouse.

A more similar question is Question 6, which asks about a potential failure point when considering the weight capacity of the treehouse. This question is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ, as it deals with the importance of considering the weight of the treehouse.

But the most similar question is actually Question 9's option A, which mentions "the weight capacity of the treehouse" as a variable to be tested and refined.

However, if I had to choose one of the questions as it is, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 6.

Hey, today we are going to have fun with learning
about Black History and a man named Malcolm X. With Black History in the United States, many
African-Americans mention Malcolm X. Do you know who Malcolm X is? Malcolm X was an African-American Civil Rights
Activist and Minister. Right now we will learn a little bit about
his life. Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19,
1925 in Omaha, Nebraska. Malcolm was the fourth of eight children born
to Louise, a homemaker, and Earl Little, a preacher. His father spoke out against racism and was
often picked on by a group named the Ku Klux Klan. It was so bad the littles had to move from
Omaha and his father was later found murdered. After the death of Malcolm’s father, Malcolm's
mother became very sick and could not take care of her children. This is where Malcolm and his siblings were
placed in foster care. Seeing all of this Malcolm would get into
trouble later on finding himself in a juvenile detention center, and later on finding himself
in prison after getting in trouble. It was there his life would change when he
discovered a religion known as Islam. After choosing the religion of Islam and joining
the Nation of Islam, Malcolm Little would soon change his name from to Malcolm X, where
he would go on to be a well-known leader of the Nation of Islam. During this time another African-American
Civil Rights Activist was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Although Dr. King spoke about peaceful protests,
Malcolm X was known for saying, “By any means necessary,” and "You don't have to
have a peaceful revolution," when speaking against racism. Malcolm X would later leave the Nation of
Islam and become a traditional Muslim where he changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. Malcolm X’s life came to an end after he
was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York, New York. That is all for me and I hope you enjoyed
learning about Black History and Malcolm X a civil rights activist and preacher. I hope you had fun learning with F.R.E.S.B.E.R.G

**Transcript**:
The evil wizard MoldeVort 
has been trying to kill you for years, and today it looks like 
he’s going to succeed. But your friends are on their way, 
and if you can survive until they arrive, they should be able to help stop him. The evil wizard’s protective charms 
ward off every spell you know, so in an act of desperation 
you throw the only object in reach at him: Pythagoras’s cursed chessboard. It works, but with a catch. MoldeVort starts in one corner 
of the 5x5 board. You have a few minutes to choose 
four distinct positive whole numbers. MoldeVort gets to say one of them, 
and if you can pick a square on the board whose center is exactly 
that distance away, the curse will force him 
to move to that spot. Then he’ll have to choose 
any of the four numbers, and the process repeats until 
you can’t keep him inside the board with legal moves. Then he’ll break free of the spell 
and almost certainly kill you. What four numbers can you choose 
to keep MoldeVort trapped by your spell long enough for help to arrive? 
And what’s your strategy? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to keep MoldeVort 
where you want him. And one way to figure out how to do that is to play out the game 
as MoldeVort would: always trying to escape. You’re dealing with a relatively 
small board, so the numbers can’t be too big. Let’s start by trying 1, 2, 3, 4 
to see what happens. Moldevort could escape those numbers
in just three moves. By saying 2, then 3, he would force you to let him into one
of the middle points of the grid, and then a 4 would break him free. But that means you’ll need to allow
a number larger than 4, which is the distance from one end 
of a row to another. How is that even possible? Through diagonal moves. There are, in fact, points that are 
distance 5 from each other, which we know thanks 
to the Pythagorean Theorem. That states that the squares 
of the sides of a right triangle add up to the square of its hypotenuse. One of the most famous 
Pythagorean triples is 3, 4, 5, and that triangle is hiding all over 
your chessboard. So if MoldeVort was here, and he said 5,
you could move him to these spaces. There’s another insight that will help. The board is very symmetrical: 
If MoldeVort is in a corner, it doesn’t really matter 
to you which corner it is. So we can think of the corners 
as being functionally the same, and color them all blue. Similarly, the spaces neighboring 
the corners behave the same as each other, and we’ll make them red. Finally, the midpoints of the sides 
are a third type. So instead of having to develop a strategy for each of the 16 spaces 
on the outside of the board, we can reduce the problem to just three. Meanwhile, all the inside spaces 
are bad for us, because if MoldeVort ever reaches one, he’ll be able to say any number 
larger than 3 and go free. Orange spaces are trouble too, 
since any number except 1, 2, or 4 would take him to an inside space 
or off the board. So orange is out and you’ll need 
to keep him on blue and red. That means 2 is bad, since it could take MoldeVort 
to orange on the first turn. But the four other smallest numbers, 
1, 3, 4, and 5, might work. Let’s try them and see what happens. If MoldeVort says 1, you can make 
him go from blue to red or red to blue. And the same works if he says 3. Thanks to our diagonals, 
this is even true if he says 5. If he says 4, you can keep him 
on the color he’s already on by moving the length of a row or column. So these four numbers work! Even if your friends don’t get here 
right away, you’ll be able to keep 
the world’s most evil wizard contained for as long as you need.

**Question 4: What is the significance of the Pythagorean Theorem in this scenario?**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that directly asks about the role or function of the numbers in the scenario.

A closer match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the purpose or function of the numbers, similar to the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the role of the numbers.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 7: Which numbers can the protagonist choose to keep the evil wizard trapped?** is the closest match, as it is related to the numbers and their purpose in the scenario.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more suitable match would be a question that directly asks about the role or function of the numbers.

**Transcript**:
The evil wizard MoldeVort 
has been trying to kill you for years, and today it looks like 
he’s going to succeed. But your friends are on their way, 
and if you can survive until they arrive, they should be able to help stop him. The evil wizard’s protective charms 
ward off every spell you know, so in an act of desperation 
you throw the only object in reach at him: Pythagoras’s cursed chessboard. It works, but with a catch. MoldeVort starts in one corner 
of the 5x5 board. You have a few minutes to choose 
four distinct positive whole numbers. MoldeVort gets to say one of them, 
and if you can pick a square on the board whose center is exactly 
that distance away, the curse will force him 
to move to that spot. Then he’ll have to choose 
any of the four numbers, and the process repeats until 
you can’t keep him inside the board with legal moves. Then he’ll break free of the spell 
and almost certainly kill you. What four numbers can you choose 
to keep MoldeVort trapped by your spell long enough for help to arrive? 
And what’s your strategy? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to keep MoldeVort 
where you want him. And one way to figure out how to do that is to play out the game 
as MoldeVort would: always trying to escape. You’re dealing with a relatively 
small board, so the numbers can’t be too big. Let’s start by trying 1, 2, 3, 4 
to see what happens. Moldevort could escape those numbers
in just three moves. By saying 2, then 3, he would force you to let him into one
of the middle points of the grid, and then a 4 would break him free. But that means you’ll need to allow
a number larger than 4, which is the distance from one end 
of a row to another. How is that even possible? Through diagonal moves. There are, in fact, points that are 
distance 5 from each other, which we know thanks 
to the Pythagorean Theorem. That states that the squares 
of the sides of a right triangle add up to the square of its hypotenuse. One of the most famous 
Pythagorean triples is 3, 4, 5, and that triangle is hiding all over 
your chessboard. So if MoldeVort was here, and he said 5,
you could move him to these spaces. There’s another insight that will help. The board is very symmetrical: 
If MoldeVort is in a corner, it doesn’t really matter 
to you which corner it is. So we can think of the corners 
as being functionally the same, and color them all blue. Similarly, the spaces neighboring 
the corners behave the same as each other, and we’ll make them red. Finally, the midpoints of the sides 
are a third type. So instead of having to develop a strategy for each of the 16 spaces 
on the outside of the board, we can reduce the problem to just three. Meanwhile, all the inside spaces 
are bad for us, because if MoldeVort ever reaches one, he’ll be able to say any number 
larger than 3 and go free. Orange spaces are trouble too, 
since any number except 1, 2, or 4 would take him to an inside space 
or off the board. So orange is out and you’ll need 
to keep him on blue and red. That means 2 is bad, since it could take MoldeVort 
to orange on the first turn. But the four other smallest numbers, 
1, 3, 4, and 5, might work. Let’s try them and see what happens. If MoldeVort says 1, you can make 
him go from blue to red or red to blue. And the same works if he says 3. Thanks to our diagonals, 
this is even true if he says 5. If he says 4, you can keep him 
on the color he’s already on by moving the length of a row or column. So these four numbers work! Even if your friends don’t get here 
right away, you’ll be able to keep 
the world’s most evil wizard contained for as long as you need.

**Transcript**:
The evil wizard MoldeVort 
has been trying to kill you for years, and today it looks like 
he’s going to succeed. But your friends are on their way, 
and if you can survive until they arrive, they should be able to help stop him. The evil wizard’s protective charms 
ward off every spell you know, so in an act of desperation 
you throw the only object in reach at him: Pythagoras’s cursed chessboard. It works, but with a catch. MoldeVort starts in one corner 
of the 5x5 board. You have a few minutes to choose 
four distinct positive whole numbers. MoldeVort gets to say one of them, 
and if you can pick a square on the board whose center is exactly 
that distance away, the curse will force him 
to move to that spot. Then he’ll have to choose 
any of the four numbers, and the process repeats until 
you can’t keep him inside the board with legal moves. Then he’ll break free of the spell 
and almost certainly kill you. What four numbers can you choose 
to keep MoldeVort trapped by your spell long enough for help to arrive? 
And what’s your strategy? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to keep MoldeVort 
where you want him. And one way to figure out how to do that is to play out the game 
as MoldeVort would: always trying to escape. You’re dealing with a relatively 
small board, so the numbers can’t be too big. Let’s start by trying 1, 2, 3, 4 
to see what happens. Moldevort could escape those numbers
in just three moves. By saying 2, then 3, he would force you to let him into one
of the middle points of the grid, and then a 4 would break him free. But that means you’ll need to allow
a number larger than 4, which is the distance from one end 
of a row to another. How is that even possible? Through diagonal moves. There are, in fact, points that are 
distance 5 from each other, which we know thanks 
to the Pythagorean Theorem. That states that the squares 
of the sides of a right triangle add up to the square of its hypotenuse. One of the most famous 
Pythagorean triples is 3, 4, 5, and that triangle is hiding all over 
your chessboard. So if MoldeVort was here, and he said 5,
you could move him to these spaces. There’s another insight that will help. The board is very symmetrical: 
If MoldeVort is in a corner, it doesn’t really matter 
to you which corner it is. So we can think of the corners 
as being functionally the same, and color them all blue. Similarly, the spaces neighboring 
the corners behave the same as each other, and we’ll make them red. Finally, the midpoints of the sides 
are a third type. So instead of having to develop a strategy for each of the 16 spaces 
on the outside of the board, we can reduce the problem to just three. Meanwhile, all the inside spaces 
are bad for us, because if MoldeVort ever reaches one, he’ll be able to say any number 
larger than 3 and go free. Orange spaces are trouble too, 
since any number except 1, 2, or 4 would take him to an inside space 
or off the board. So orange is out and you’ll need 
to keep him on blue and red. That means 2 is bad, since it could take MoldeVort 
to orange on the first turn. But the four other smallest numbers, 
1, 3, 4, and 5, might work. Let’s try them and see what happens. If MoldeVort says 1, you can make 
him go from blue to red or red to blue. And the same works if he says 3. Thanks to our diagonals, 
this is even true if he says 5. If he says 4, you can keep him 
on the color he’s already on by moving the length of a row or column. So these four numbers work! Even if your friends don’t get here 
right away, you’ll be able to keep 
the world’s most evil wizard contained for as long as you need.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

This question asks about the significance of the Pythagorean Theorem in the scenario, and the correct option (C) states that it helps the protagonist calculate the distance between spaces. This is closely related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks how distance is measured on the chessboard and has the correct option (A) stating that it is measured as straight line distances from the center of each square.

However, an even more similar question is Question 9, which asks about the role of the diagonals in the scenario. The correct option (C) states that they help the protagonist calculate the distance between spaces, which is closely related to the concept of measuring distance as straight line distances from the center of each square.

But the most similar question is actually Question 11, which asks about the significance of the Pythagorean triple 3, 4, 5 in the scenario. The correct option (C) states that it helps the protagonist calculate the distance between spaces, which is closely related to the concept of measuring distance as straight line distances from the center of each square.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that Question 4, Question 9, and Question 11 all relate to the concept of distance measurement, but none of them directly ask how distance is measured on the chessboard.

A more direct match is not available in the provided generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, but with a clarification that it's not a perfect match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the suffix that does not make the "L" sound, whereas the generated MCQs focus on the usage of the letter "L" in word tales, its frequency, and exceptions to the rules.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 8. However, please note that Question 8 does not ask about suffixes or sounds, but rather about exceptions to the rule of using "L" after certain letters.

A more suitable generated MCQ is not available in the provided set. Therefore, I must emphasize that the similarity between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs is limited.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 6: Which of the following words is an exception to the rule of using "l" after the letters "m" and "n"? Options: A. Metal, B. Travel, C. Signal, D. None of the above Correct Option: C**

However, this question is asking for an example of an exception, whereas the ground truth MCQ is asking for which word is NOT an exception. A more similar question would be one that asks for a word that is not an exception.

A more similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 14 is not the most similar, but it is the closest after Question 6 and 7. However, Question 7 is essentially the same as Question 6.**

However, if we look at the options in Question 7 and the ground truth MCQ, we can see that the ground truth MCQ has the word "towel" as an option which is not present in any of the generated MCQs. But we can see that Question 7 and the ground truth MCQ both contain the word "signal" as an option.

But if we look at the intent of the question and the options provided, we can see that **Question 7** is essentially asking the same thing as the ground truth MCQ, but it is asking for an example of an exception instead of which word is not an exception.

However, **Question 6** is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of the options provided.

But if we have to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the intent of the question, I would say that **Question 6 and Question 7** are not the most similar, but **Question 6** is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of the options provided.

However, I can see that **Question 14** is essentially the same as **Question 6 and Question 7**.

However, I can see that the most similar generated MCQ is actually **Question 6**.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **6**

**Transcript**:
A new virus emerges 
and spreads like wildfire. In order to contain it, researchers must first collect data 
about who’s been infected. Two main viral testing techniques 
are critical: one tells you if you have the virus and the other shows 
if you’ve already had it. So, how exactly do these tests work? PCR, or polymerase chain 
reaction testing, targets the virus’s genetic material 
in the body and is used to diagnose someone 
who is currently infected. Yet, this genetic material may be present 
in such imperceptible amounts that actually detecting it is difficult. This is where PCR comes in: it’s widely used to amplify genetic 
information to large enough quantities that it can be readily observed. To develop a PCR test 
for a never-before-seen virus, researchers first sequence 
its genetic material, or genome, and identify regions that are unique 
to that specific virus. PCR then targets 
these particular segments. A PCR test begins by collecting a sample: this can be blood for hepatitis viruses, 
feces for poliovirus, and samples from the nose or throat 
for coronaviruses. The sample is taken 
to a central laboratory where PCR is performed to test 
for the presence of the virus’ genome. Genetic information can be encoded 
via DNA or RNA. HPV, for example, uses DNA, 
while SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, uses RNA. Before running the PCR, 
the viral RNA— if present— must be reverse transcribed 
to make a strand of complementary DNA. Researchers then run the PCR. If the virus is present in the sample, 
its unique regions of genetic code will be identified by complementary 
primers and copied by enzymes. One strand of DNA becomes 
hundreds of millions, which are detected using probes marked
with fluorescent dye. If the PCR machine senses fluorescence, the sample has tested positive 
for the virus, meaning the individual is infected. Immunoassays, on the other hand, tap into the immune system’s 
memory of the virus, showing if someone has previously 
been infected. They work by targeting virus-specific
antibodies generated by the immune system during infection. These are specialized classes of proteins that identify and fight foreign 
substances, like viruses. Immunoassays may detect IgG antibodies, 
the most abundant class, and IgM antibodies, the type that’s first 
produced in response to a new infection. The presence of IgM antibodies suggests 
a recent infection, but since it can take the body over 
a week to produce a detectable amount, they’re unreliable in diagnosing 
current infections. Meanwhile, IgG antibodies circulate 
for an extended period after infection; their presence usually indicates 
that someone was exposed and recovered. Before the immunoassay, health professionals draw blood 
from an individual. This sample then comes into contact 
with a portion of the virus of interest. If the body has, in fact, been exposed 
to the virus in the past, the body’s virus-specific antibodies 
will bind to it during the test. This reaction produces a change in color, 
indicating that the sample tested positive and that the individual has been 
exposed to the virus. Immunoassays are especially important when it comes to retroactively 
diagnosing people who were infected but went untested. And there’s exciting potential for those
who have developed immunity to a virus: in some cases, their blood plasma 
could be used as treatment in people who are currently fighting it. PCR and immunoassays are always 
in the process of becoming more accurate and efficient. For example, innovations in PCR have led to the use
of self-contained testing devices that relay results within one hour. Digital PCR, which quantifies individual 
pieces of target DNA, shows promise in further
boosting accuracy. And although immunoassays are difficult 
to develop quickly, researchers in Singapore were able 
to create one for SARS-CoV-2 even before COVID-19 was declared 
a pandemic. These tests— along with the scientists 
who develop them and the health professionals 
who administer them— are absolutely essential. And when deployed early, 
they can save millions of lives.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why do scientists even need to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing?

**Transcript**:
A new virus emerges 
and spreads like wildfire. In order to contain it, researchers must first collect data 
about who’s been infected. Two main viral testing techniques 
are critical: one tells you if you have the virus and the other shows 
if you’ve already had it. So, how exactly do these tests work? PCR, or polymerase chain 
reaction testing, targets the virus’s genetic material 
in the body and is used to diagnose someone 
who is currently infected. Yet, this genetic material may be present 
in such imperceptible amounts that actually detecting it is difficult. This is where PCR comes in: it’s widely used to amplify genetic 
information to large enough quantities that it can be readily observed. To develop a PCR test 
for a never-before-seen virus, researchers first sequence 
its genetic material, or genome, and identify regions that are unique 
to that specific virus. PCR then targets 
these particular segments. A PCR test begins by collecting a sample: this can be blood for hepatitis viruses, 
feces for poliovirus, and samples from the nose or throat 
for coronaviruses. The sample is taken 
to a central laboratory where PCR is performed to test 
for the presence of the virus’ genome. Genetic information can be encoded 
via DNA or RNA. HPV, for example, uses DNA, 
while SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, uses RNA. Before running the PCR, 
the viral RNA— if present— must be reverse transcribed 
to make a strand of complementary DNA. Researchers then run the PCR. If the virus is present in the sample, 
its unique regions of genetic code will be identified by complementary 
primers and copied by enzymes. One strand of DNA becomes 
hundreds of millions, which are detected using probes marked
with fluorescent dye. If the PCR machine senses fluorescence, the sample has tested positive 
for the virus, meaning the individual is infected. Immunoassays, on the other hand, tap into the immune system’s 
memory of the virus, showing if someone has previously 
been infected. They work by targeting virus-specific
antibodies generated by the immune system during infection. These are specialized classes of proteins that identify and fight foreign 
substances, like viruses. Immunoassays may detect IgG antibodies, 
the most abundant class, and IgM antibodies, the type that’s first 
produced in response to a new infection. The presence of IgM antibodies suggests 
a recent infection, but since it can take the body over 
a week to produce a detectable amount, they’re unreliable in diagnosing 
current infections. Meanwhile, IgG antibodies circulate 
for an extended period after infection; their presence usually indicates 
that someone was exposed and recovered. Before the immunoassay, health professionals draw blood 
from an individual. This sample then comes into contact 
with a portion of the virus of interest. If the body has, in fact, been exposed 
to the virus in the past, the body’s virus-specific antibodies 
will bind to it during the test. This reaction produces a change in color, 
indicating that the sample tested positive and that the individual has been 
exposed to the virus. Immunoassays are especially important when it comes to retroactively 
diagnosing people who were infected but went untested. And there’s exciting potential for those
who have developed immunity to a virus: in some cases, their blood plasma 
could be used as treatment in people who are currently fighting it. PCR and immunoassays are always 
in the process of becoming more accurate and efficient. For example, innovations in PCR have led to the use
of self-contained testing devices that relay results within one hour. Digital PCR, which quantifies individual 
pieces of target DNA, shows promise in further
boosting accuracy. And although immunoassays are difficult 
to develop quickly, researchers in Singapore were able 
to create one for SARS-CoV-2 even before COVID-19 was declared 
a pandemic. These tests— along with the scientists 
who develop them and the health professionals 
who administer them— are absolutely essential. And when deployed early, 
they can save millions of lives.

**Transcript**:
Nipah. Hendra. Ebola. Marburg. SARS. These
are some of the world’s scariest viruses. Hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola are extremely
fatal – they kill up to 90 percent of people infected – while SARS, a coronavirus, has
a lower mortality rate but spreads incredibly rapidly. All of these nasty pathogens have
surfaced in humans in just the last 50 years, and they are all carried by bats. Which, to be clear, really isn’t bats’
fault: the recent rise in outbreaks is likely due to humans and our animals creeping ever-farther
into bats’ territory, especially in the tropics. In Malaysia, for example, the spread
of commercial pig farms into bat-inhabited forests led to the first human outbreak - via
pigs - of Nipah. And in Australia, human hendra cases are cropping up as destruction native
forests forces fruit bats to feed in suburban gardens. But still: bats do appear to carry more human-killing
diseases than pretty much any other animal. One big reason is that, with a few notable
exceptions, bats love company  — different kinds of bats  often roost together in huge
numbers and close quarters, which helps viruses spread not just between individuals, but also
between species . What’s more, most infected bats don’t
die — they live pretty normal bat lives,  flapping around and giving the viruses time
to spread. In fact, flight may be the reason bats are so resilient to infection. As a rule, mammals can’t produce the immense
amount of energy needed for flight without also producing a lot of reactive waste products
that damage our DNA. So when our bat cousins took to the air, they leveled-up their in-flight
DNA damage repair kits and other defenses, including specialized cells that keep viral
invaders in check. So bats can survive the deadly viruses - but
what may matter even more, for humans anyway, is how the viruses survive the bats. Nasty as they are, most viruses are also extremely
finicky — in order to thrive, they require the perfectly controlled climate inside a
normal, resting, on-the-ground mammal. But when bats take to the air, their internal
temperatures cruise to around 40°C. Those frequent in-flight saunas are far too toasty
for your average virus, but a few hardy viruses have evolved to tolerate the heat.  Which,
incidentally, means they can definitely weather a meager human fever. Essentially, flight
may have helped bats gain virtual immunity to viruses AND trained viruses to be virtually
immune to us. Stupid flying. So, what should we land-lubbers do? We need
bats for insect control and pollination - and a whole bunch of other things - maybe we could
even learn some immune tricks from them - like how to be really good at not getting cancer!
Plus, bats aren’t the biggest carriers of human disease. Humans are - just do the math.
Perhaps we’d be better off leaving bats alone, and trying to control the spread of
diseases carried by a different kind of flying mammal.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to coronaviruses and RNA viruses, while the ground truth MCQ is related to verb tenses and the use of the suffix "-ed" to form the past tense.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the question format (True or False) and the presence of a clear correct option, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ.

But if you really need an index, I can tell you that the generated MCQs are not similar to the ground truth MCQ, but the closest in terms of being a "True or False" question is not present, but the closest in terms of having a clear correct option would be Question 6, but it's not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

So I would say that there is no similar generated MCQ, but if you need an index, I can tell you that Question 6 is the closest, but it's not similar.

Index: No similar generated MCQ, but if you need an index: 6 (keep in mind that Question 6 is not similar to the ground truth MCQ)

**Transcript**:
For almost a decade, scientists chased 
the source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains 
and most isolated caverns. They finally found it here: 
in the bats of Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes 
that look like a crown— or "corona" in Latin. There are hundreds 
of known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, 
and can cause disease. The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, 
MERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes 
the disease COVID-19. Of the seven human coronaviruses, 
four cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections 
of the nose and throat. Two infect the lungs, 
and cause much more severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID-19, 
has features of each: it spreads easily, 
but can severely impact the lungs. When an infected person coughs, 
droplets containing the virus spray out. The virus can infect a new person when
the droplets enter their nose or mouth. Coronaviruses transmit best 
in enclosed spaces, where people are close together. Cold weather keeps their delicate casing
from drying out, enabling the virus to survive 
for longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight 
may damage it. These seasonal variations matter more 
for established viruses. But because no one is yet immune 
to a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it
doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread. In the body, the protein spikes embed
in the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack 
the host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes. Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA. All viruses are either RNA viruses 
or DNA viruses. RNA viruses tend to be smaller, 
with fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts 
and replicate quickly in those hosts. In general, RNA viruses don’t have 
a proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do. So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have 
mistakes called mutations. Many of these mutations are useless 
or even harmful. But some make the virus better suited
for certain environments— like a new host species. Epidemics often occur when a virus 
jumps from animals to humans. This is true of the RNA viruses 
that caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, 
and the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, 
or strains, of the original one. Coronaviruses have a few key differences 
from most RNA viruses. They’re some of the largest, 
meaning they have the most genes. That creates more opportunity 
for harmful mutations. To counteract this risk, 
coronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication 
errors and corrects mistakes. This makes coronaviruses 
much more stable, with a slower mutation rate, 
than other RNA viruses. While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate 
is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them. After an infection, our immune systems 
can recognize germs and destroy them more quickly 
if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick. But mutations can make a virus 
less recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can also make antiviral drugs 
and vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored 
very specifically to a virus. That’s why we need a new flu vaccine
every year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly 
that new strains pop up constantly. The slower mutation rate 
of coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, 
and vaccines might be able to recognize them 
for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. Still, we don’t know how long our bodies
remain immune to different coronaviruses. There’s never been an approved treatment
or vaccine for a coronavirus. We haven’t focused on treating 
the ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing
treatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those 
treatments completed clinical trials. As we continue to encroach 
on other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus 
jumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, 
it doesn’t have to be devastating.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a completely different topic, such as a story about a caterpillar, reading, and eating habits.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose an index, I would say -1 or "Not Found" because there isn't a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

If you could provide more generated MCQs that are related to the topic of coronaviruses, I would be happy to help you identify the most similar one.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 10, Question 4
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
For almost a decade, scientists chased 
the source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains 
and most isolated caverns. They finally found it here: 
in the bats of Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes 
that look like a crown— or "corona" in Latin. There are hundreds 
of known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, 
and can cause disease. The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, 
MERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes 
the disease COVID-19. Of the seven human coronaviruses, 
four cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections 
of the nose and throat. Two infect the lungs, 
and cause much more severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID-19, 
has features of each: it spreads easily, 
but can severely impact the lungs. When an infected person coughs, 
droplets containing the virus spray out. The virus can infect a new person when
the droplets enter their nose or mouth. Coronaviruses transmit best 
in enclosed spaces, where people are close together. Cold weather keeps their delicate casing
from drying out, enabling the virus to survive 
for longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight 
may damage it. These seasonal variations matter more 
for established viruses. But because no one is yet immune 
to a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it
doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread. In the body, the protein spikes embed
in the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack 
the host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes. Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA. All viruses are either RNA viruses 
or DNA viruses. RNA viruses tend to be smaller, 
with fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts 
and replicate quickly in those hosts. In general, RNA viruses don’t have 
a proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do. So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have 
mistakes called mutations. Many of these mutations are useless 
or even harmful. But some make the virus better suited
for certain environments— like a new host species. Epidemics often occur when a virus 
jumps from animals to humans. This is true of the RNA viruses 
that caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, 
and the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, 
or strains, of the original one. Coronaviruses have a few key differences 
from most RNA viruses. They’re some of the largest, 
meaning they have the most genes. That creates more opportunity 
for harmful mutations. To counteract this risk, 
coronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication 
errors and corrects mistakes. This makes coronaviruses 
much more stable, with a slower mutation rate, 
than other RNA viruses. While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate 
is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them. After an infection, our immune systems 
can recognize germs and destroy them more quickly 
if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick. But mutations can make a virus 
less recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can also make antiviral drugs 
and vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored 
very specifically to a virus. That’s why we need a new flu vaccine
every year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly 
that new strains pop up constantly. The slower mutation rate 
of coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, 
and vaccines might be able to recognize them 
for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. Still, we don’t know how long our bodies
remain immune to different coronaviruses. There’s never been an approved treatment
or vaccine for a coronavirus. We haven’t focused on treating 
the ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing
treatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those 
treatments completed clinical trials. As we continue to encroach 
on other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus 
jumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, 
it doesn’t have to be devastating.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is related to the story about a caterpillar, while the generated MCQs are related to a different story, "There was an old lady who swallowed a fly".

However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one, I would say Question 3 is the most similar in terms of the theme of "consequences of eating something" but it's still very different from the ground truth MCQ.

So, I would say the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 3 (but with a note that it's still not very similar).

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the first thing the caterpillar eats in the story "I thought the caterpillar would never be full," while the generated MCQs are related to a different story, "There was an old lady who swallowed a fly."

Since there is no matching generated MCQ, I would say that there is no similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one based on the closest possible match in terms of question intent (i.e., asking about eating or consuming something), I would say that Question 2 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Index: No match (or Question 2, but with a very low confidence level)

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about a caterpillar eating oranges, while the generated MCQs are about a nursery rhyme involving an old lady swallowing various animals.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the fact that it involves a question about consuming something, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match. But please note that this is a very loose match and the question intent, options, and content are still quite different.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different story or rhyme, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the story about a caterpillar.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the theme of eating and consequences, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match. But this is a very weak match, as the question intent, options, and content are still quite different.

Therefore, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, it would be:

None (or Question 5, but with a very low confidence level)

It's worth noting that the generated MCQs seem to be related to a different story or rhyme, and it would be better to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the story about the caterpillar.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about a caterpillar eating a green leaf and the consequences of its actions, while the generated MCQs are about a completely different topic, a nursery rhyme about an old lady swallowing various objects.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall theme of consequences of actions, I would choose Question 5: What might happen if you swallow a fly, according to the rhyme? Options: A. You'll get a prize, B. You might die, C. You'll get a treat, D. You'll get a cold Correct Option: B.

This question is still quite different from the ground truth MCQ, but it's the closest in terms of theme. The index of this generated MCQ is 5.

Please note that this is a very weak match, and it's not recommended to use this generated MCQ as a replacement for the ground truth MCQ. A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically designed to match the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one that is the least dissimilar in terms of format, I would say Question 6, but it is still very dissimilar.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is related to the story "There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly" and asks why the old lady swallowed a bird. The generated MCQs, on the other hand, appear to be related to a different topic, such as Native American tribes and their cultures.

Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I would not be able to provide an index of the most similar generated MCQ. However, I can suggest that a new set of generated MCQs that are relevant to the story "There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly" would be needed to find a match.

**Transcript**:
[Music] Not everybody likes the same kind of food, right? That's probably a good thing. 
I mean, all the more pizza for me! But whether we eat milkshakes or mangoes, 
pizzas or pears, tacos or toast, we use the energy that's in 
our food to stay alive. But how did that energy get
 into our food in the first place? The answer is that energy 
flows between living things. It's almost like each form of food 
is a link in a chain...a food chain! You might have heard that humans are on the top of the food chain because we eat pretty much everything, and except for the occasional 
video game monster and maybe the odd bear, 
nothing tries to eat us. But what is a food chain, exactly? A food chain is a model that shows 
how energy flows between living things. You can think of animals and plants in the same food chain as all living in the same neighborhood, 
which scientists call a "habitat." And they all have a job to do, 
interacting with each other, day in and day out. Together, they form a kind of system. A self-contained collection of different things 
that all work together as a whole. And, they also interact with the 
non-living stuff around them, like the water, the air, the ground, and the sun. Put it all together, and what do you get? A special system 
called an "ecosystem!" And food chains show us 
what eats what in an ecosystem. Now, everything that's alive is in a food chain. Including you, my friend! And actually, most living things 
are in more than one food chain, depending on what, or who, 
they're munching on at the moment. I mean, you don't eat the same thing 
for dinner every night, do you? Didn't think so! Now, let's see how a food chain works, by making a diagram of how 
these interactions happen in nature. First, all of the energy that's 
in a food chain starts with the Sun. I can't stress that enough, people! Plants take the energy from the Sun's rays and change it into chemical energy. So, when a nice patch of 
lush, green grass starts to grow, it's capturing some of the energy 
from the Sun to do it. Then when an animal, like a rabbit, 
wanders by and nibbles on that grass, the energy from the plant is 
transferred into the rabbit's body. Now, if hungry hawk decides that the 
rabbit would make a yummy supper, then the energy from the rabbit 
is transferred to the hawk. And in this ecosystem, nothing is large 
or brave enough to take on the hawk. I mean, just look at her! So, we've hit the top of the food chain, and we've just made a nifty model of it. So, a food chain is a model that shows how energy flows between living things in an ecosystem. Energy in a food chain starts with the Sun, which is turned into chemical energy by plants. And this energy moves up the food chain 
as animals eat the plants, and then other animals eat those animals. And speaking of energy, I'm starving! So I'm off to take my place in the food chain. See you next time!

**Transcript**:
[Music] Not everybody likes the same kind of food, right? That's probably a good thing. 
I mean, all the more pizza for me! But whether we eat milkshakes or mangoes, 
pizzas or pears, tacos or toast, we use the energy that's in 
our food to stay alive. But how did that energy get
 into our food in the first place? The answer is that energy 
flows between living things. It's almost like each form of food 
is a link in a chain...a food chain! You might have heard that humans are on the top of the food chain because we eat pretty much everything, and except for the occasional 
video game monster and maybe the odd bear, 
nothing tries to eat us. But what is a food chain, exactly? A food chain is a model that shows 
how energy flows between living things. You can think of animals and plants in the same food chain as all living in the same neighborhood, 
which scientists call a "habitat." And they all have a job to do, 
interacting with each other, day in and day out. Together, they form a kind of system. A self-contained collection of different things 
that all work together as a whole. And, they also interact with the 
non-living stuff around them, like the water, the air, the ground, and the sun. Put it all together, and what do you get? A special system 
called an "ecosystem!" And food chains show us 
what eats what in an ecosystem. Now, everything that's alive is in a food chain. Including you, my friend! And actually, most living things 
are in more than one food chain, depending on what, or who, 
they're munching on at the moment. I mean, you don't eat the same thing 
for dinner every night, do you? Didn't think so! Now, let's see how a food chain works, by making a diagram of how 
these interactions happen in nature. First, all of the energy that's 
in a food chain starts with the Sun. I can't stress that enough, people! Plants take the energy from the Sun's rays and change it into chemical energy. So, when a nice patch of 
lush, green grass starts to grow, it's capturing some of the energy 
from the Sun to do it. Then when an animal, like a rabbit, 
wanders by and nibbles on that grass, the energy from the plant is 
transferred into the rabbit's body. Now, if hungry hawk decides that the 
rabbit would make a yummy supper, then the energy from the rabbit 
is transferred to the hawk. And in this ecosystem, nothing is large 
or brave enough to take on the hawk. I mean, just look at her! So, we've hit the top of the food chain, and we've just made a nifty model of it. So, a food chain is a model that shows how energy flows between living things in an ecosystem. Energy in a food chain starts with the Sun, which is turned into chemical energy by plants. And this energy moves up the food chain 
as animals eat the plants, and then other animals eat those animals. And speaking of energy, I'm starving! So I'm off to take my place in the food chain. See you next time!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the interaction between animals and plants in a habitat, while the generated MCQs are about unrelated topics such as haircuts, nerves, and pain.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the general concept of systems and interactions, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but only in a very general sense. Question 5 asks about the relationship between nerves and the sense of touch, and the correct answer mentions that nerves help us sense the world around us. This is a very broad concept that could be related to the idea of animals and plants interacting in a habitat, but it's a huge stretch.

So, my answer would be: None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say Question 5, with the caveat that it's a very poor match.

Index: 5 (with the caveat that it's a very poor match)

**Transcript**:
[ ♪ Intro ♪ ] It’s that time again! I’m getting a haircut later today. lots of people get them   Sometimes people decide to cut their hair
much shorter, and sometimes they just get a trim, like I am. Even Squeaks had a little trim when he got
a piece of gum stuck his fur, remember, Squeaks? [Squeaks squeaks] But there’s something that all haircuts
have in common: They don’t hurt! When you think about it, it might seem kind
of weird that they don’t. I mean, if you get a cut on almost any other
part of your body, like your finger, it definitely hurts! But when someone cuts your hair, as long as
you hold very still, it doesn’t hurt at all! There’s also another place on our bodies
that it doesn’t hurt to cut, and we do it all the time. Can you guess what it is, Squeaks? [Squeaks guesses] That’s right — our nails! The reason it doesn’t hurt to cut your hair,
toenails, or fingernails is that they don’t have nerves inside them. A nerve is a type of body part you have all
over the inside of your body, kind of like how you have muscles all over. These nerves have a special job to do: they
carry messages between different places in your body. Now, you have lots of body parts. So nerves have lots of jobs. But one of the biggest jobs nerves have is
to help you sense the world around you. Nerves are the reason you can see, hear, smell,
taste … and yes, feel things! Nerves are a big part of the sense of touch. Squeaks, can I touch your nose to show how
this works? [Squeaks squeaks] When you touch something [taps Squeaks on
the nose], it brushes up against your skin. And, like most parts of your body, your skin
has nerves in it. When something touches your skin, it activates,
or kind of ‘turns on’ the nerves. These nerves can feel all kinds of different
things. Some of them feel whether something is warm
or cold. Others can help us tell if something is smooth
or rough. And there are also some that are in charge
of sensing pain. When I tap Squeaks’ nose, some of the nerves
in my finger get switched on, and each one sends a message. Those messages travel through my hands … up
my arm … through a big bundle of nerves that’s in my back … and all the way to
my brain! Then, my brain decodes the messages. It checks if I’ve ever touched anything
like this before, and combines that with any other information it can get, like if I can
see the thing I’m feeling. This all happens really fast, which is how
I can figure out what I’m touching right away — Squeaks’ nose! [Squeaks sneezes] Oh, I’m sorry ! I guess your nose is kinda
ticklish, Squeaks! So, our sense of touch takes more than just
our hands. It also takes our nerves, and our brains,
too! But what about our hair? Well, try this. Pat the top of your head. Just like the skin that’s on your fingers,
the skin that’s under your hair has nerves. So your fingers can feel the top of your head,
and your head can feel your fingers touching it! Just like how Squeaks felt my finger with
his nose. Now find the very end of a piece of hair and
try squeezing it, without pulling on it at all. Your fingers can feel your hair, but your
hair can’t feel your fingers! That’s because there are no nerves inside
your hair. And as long as you’re not pulling on your
hair, or moving it around too much, you’re not going to feel a thing. The same goes for the very ends of your fingernails
and toenails. They don’t have nerves in them either. No nerves means no sense of touch, so they
don’t feel anything. And if there’s no sense of touch, there’s
no pain. So the next time you get a haircut, now you’ll
know why it doesn’t hurt! [Squeaks squeaks] Yikes, you’re right Squeaks — I should
go if I don’t want to be late for my haircut! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: What is the role of nerves in our body? Options: A. To provide blood flow, B. To carry oxygen, C. To send messages to the brain, D. To regulate body temperature Correct Option: C**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the brain decoding messages from nerves, while Question 8 asks about the role of nerves in sending messages to the brain. Both questions relate to the communication between nerves and the brain.

However, if I had to choose a question that more closely matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match. The ground truth MCQ is quite specific about the brain decoding messages from nerves, and none of the generated MCQs capture this exact concept.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: **8** (with the caveat that it's not an exact match)

[ ♪ Intro ♪ ] It’s that time again! I’m getting a haircut later today. lots of people get them   Sometimes people decide to cut their hair
much shorter, and sometimes they just get a trim, like I am. Even Squeaks had a little trim when he got
a piece of gum stuck his fur, remember, Squeaks? [Squeaks squeaks] But there’s something that all haircuts
have in common: They don’t hurt! When you think about it, it might seem kind
of weird that they don’t. I mean, if you get a cut on almost any other
part of your body, like your finger, it definitely hurts! But when someone cuts your hair, as long as
you hold very still, it doesn’t hurt at all! There’s also another place on our bodies
that it doesn’t hurt to cut, and we do it all the time. Can you guess what it is, Squeaks? [Squeaks guesses] That’s right — our nails! The reason it doesn’t hurt to cut your hair,
toenails, or fingernails is that they don’t have nerves inside them. A nerve is a type of body part you have all
over the inside of your body, kind of like how you have muscles all over. These nerves have a special job to do: they
carry messages between different places in your body. Now, you have lots of body parts. So nerves have lots of jobs. But one of the biggest jobs nerves have is
to help you sense the world around you. Nerves are the reason you can see, hear, smell,
taste … and yes, feel things! Nerves are a big part of the sense of touch. Squeaks, can I touch your nose to show how
this works? [Squeaks squeaks] When you touch something [taps Squeaks on
the nose], it brushes up against your skin. And, like most parts of your body, your skin
has nerves in it. When something touches your skin, it activates,
or kind of ‘turns on’ the nerves. These nerves can feel all kinds of different
things. Some of them feel whether something is warm
or cold. Others can help us tell if something is smooth
or rough. And there are also some that are in charge
of sensing pain. When I tap Squeaks’ nose, some of the nerves

♪INTRO♪ Hey, Squeaks... (Squeaks squeaks) Oh, I'm ok. My leg just feels kinda weird... It’s tingling, but in a way that feels prickly! [Squeaks Squeaks] Oh yeah, you're right! I think my leg is asleep! Maybe this has happened to you before, too. Sometimes if you’ve been doing something
that presses on your arms or legs for a while, like sitting in one position or leaning on
your elbow, it’ll start to go numb and you can’t feel as much with that part of your
body. Then, once you move so you’re not sitting
or leaning that way anymore, your arm or leg starts to get all prickly, almost like you’re
getting lots of tiny pokes all over, even though there’s nothing actually poking you. People sometimes call that feeling pins and
needles. And that sounds a lot like what happened to
me! It’s something that can feel pretty weird,
even though it happens to people all the time. When we say that an arm or leg fell asleep,
we don’t really mean that it was asleep the way you are when you fall asleep at night. It’s just called that because you can’t
feel much with it while it’s numb, almost like it’s sleeping. And that tingling, pins and needles feeling
you get when you shift your position is kind of like your arm or leg is waking up! You get that prickly feeling because your
body is a little bit confused. You might already know that there’s blood
moving everywhere in your body all the time, pumped through little tubes called blood vessels
by your heart. It’s really important that the blood moves
through all the parts of your body, because that’s how they get energy so they can work
properly. But when you sit in one position or lean on
your arm or leg for a while, you’re pressing on those blood vessels and making the tubes
smaller, so not as much blood can get through. And without enough blood, your arm or leg
can start to go numb. The reason you can feel something when you
touch it is because of little things called nerves that are all over your body. Whenever you pick up a toy or touch something
that’s hot or cold or hurts, these nerves are like little messengers that tell your
brain all about what you’re touching. But the nerves only work well if they’re
getting enough blood. I must have sat in a way that was pressing
on his leg for a few minutes, the nerves in my leg weren’t getting enough blood. So my leg stopped being able to feel as much
— it went numb and fell asleep. But then I moved! And once my body wasn’t pressing on his
leg anymore, more blood started moving through it again and his nerves woke up. But nerves get a liiiittle confused when they
wake up. At first, they don’t really know /what/
you’re feeling. They start telling your brain that you’re
feeling tiny little pokes, even though nothing is really touching you! That’s where the pins and needles feeling
comes from. Pretty soon, your nerves get used to having
enough blood again and go right back to normal. So to keep yourself from getting pins and
needles, you can just make sure you don’t sit or lean in one position for too long. And if you do get them, all you have to do
is just wait. You can shake around the arm or leg in the
meantime to help the blood get flowing again, but either way, the prickling will go away
after a minute or two. Whew, Squeaks! It feels like my nerves are finally getting
back to normal! My leg is better now! But now the next time I get pins and needles,
I’ll know all about why it happens. And so will you! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun

♪INTRO♪ Hey, Squeaks... (Squeaks squeaks) Oh, I'm ok. My leg just feels kinda weird... It’s tingling, but in a way that feels prickly! [Squeaks Squeaks] Oh yeah, you're right! I think my leg is asleep! Maybe this has happened to you before, too. Sometimes if you’ve been doing something
that presses on your arms or legs for a while, like sitting in one position or leaning on
your elbow, it’ll start to go numb and you can’t feel as much with that part of your
body. Then, once you move so you’re not sitting
or leaning that way anymore, your arm or leg starts to get all prickly, almost like you’re
getting lots of tiny pokes all over, even though there’s nothing actually poking you. People sometimes call that feeling pins and
needles. And that sounds a lot like what happened to
me! It’s something that can feel pretty weird,
even though it happens to people all the time. When we say that an arm or leg fell asleep,
we don’t really mean that it was asleep the way you are when you fall asleep at night. It’s just called that because you can’t
feel much with it while it’s numb, almost like it’s sleeping. And that tingling, pins and needles feeling
you get when you shift your position is kind of like your arm or leg is waking up! You get that prickly feeling because your
body is a little bit confused. You might already know that there’s blood
moving everywhere in your body all the time, pumped through little tubes called blood vessels
by your heart. It’s really important that the blood moves
through all the parts of your body, because that’s how they get energy so they can work
properly. But when you sit in one position or lean on
your arm or leg for a while, you’re pressing on those blood vessels and making the tubes
smaller, so not as much blood can get through. And without enough blood, your arm or leg
can start to go numb. The reason you can feel something when you
touch it is because of little things called nerves that are all over your body. Whenever you pick up a toy or touch something
that’s hot or cold or hurts, these nerves are like little messengers that tell your
brain all about what you’re touching. But the nerves only work well if they’re
getting enough blood. I must have sat in a way that was pressing
on his leg for a few minutes, the nerves in my leg weren’t getting enough blood. So my leg stopped being able to feel as much
— it went numb and fell asleep. But then I moved! And once my body wasn’t pressing on his
leg anymore, more blood started moving through it again and his nerves woke up. But nerves get a liiiittle confused when they
wake up. At first, they don’t really know /what/
you’re feeling. They start telling your brain that you’re
feeling tiny little pokes, even though nothing is really touching you! That’s where the pins and needles feeling
comes from. Pretty soon, your nerves get used to having
enough blood again and go right back to normal. So to keep yourself from getting pins and
needles, you can just make sure you don’t sit or lean in one position for too long. And if you do get them, all you have to do
is just wait. You can shake around the arm or leg in the
meantime to help the blood get flowing again, but either way, the prickling will go away
after a minute or two. Whew, Squeaks! It feels like my nerves are finally getting
back to normal! My leg is better now! But now the next time I get pins and needles,
I’ll know all about why it happens. And so will you! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of emotional state or sentiment.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Cat's emotional state at the beginning of the story, specifically how he feels about teaching Kitty School. The closest generated MCQ that deals with emotional state is Question 9, which asks about the emotional state of the student when the Pluralator goes out of control.

Although the context and content are different, both questions deal with emotional states. Therefore, I would say that Question 9 is the closest match, but it's still not a good match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 9

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is least dissimilar.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about what Cat does NOT teach the kittens at school, with options related to activities (music, exercise, building, art).

The generated MCQs are mostly unrelated to the ground truth MCQ, but Question 4 is the least dissimilar in terms of format and content. However, it is still unrelated to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, but it's still a very poor match.

Index: 4

Please note that this is a very weak match, and it's not recommended to use this generated MCQ as a substitute for the ground truth MCQ. A new generated MCQ that is specifically designed to match the ground truth MCQ would be a better option.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the topic of open and closed syllables as discussed in the transcript.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that the topic of the generated MCQs is mostly related to compound words, which is not relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would need generated MCQs that cover the topic of open and closed syllables.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is related to compound words and the elimination of one of the letter "Ls" when a word with two "Ls" is joined with another word.

However, since I need to provide an answer, I will select the generated MCQ that is least dissimilar to the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs are even remotely similar to the ground truth MCQ.

In this case, I will select "None" as the answer, but since I need to provide a numerical index, I will select the first generated MCQ (index 1) as a placeholder, even though it is not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 1 (Note: This is a placeholder answer, as none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the meaning of the word "eliminated" based on the context of the video, while the generated MCQs are about resources, human resources, services, and other unrelated topics.

However, if I had to choose the one that is closest in terms of question intent (i.e., defining a term), I would say that Question 6 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

A more suitable answer would be "No matching MCQ found". However, since you asked for the index of the most similar generated MCQ, I will provide it:

Index: 6 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

This question has multiple options that describe different actions, and the correct answer is "All of the above", similar to the ground truth MCQ.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 4

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about Peter's excitement at the end of the story, which is related to the snowstorm, but none of the generated MCQs mention Peter or a snowstorm.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the context of the transcript, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say Question 9 is the most similar, only because it mentions Ms. Linda, who is the narrator in the transcript. However, the question intent, options, and content are still unrelated to the ground truth MCQ.

Index: 9 (Note: This is a very weak match and should be taken as an indication that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.)

There are more than one and a half billion
people out there using the internet every day, and just like you, they're looking for
answers. We here at SciShow are looking for answers
too, answers to questions about science and nature and the human body, Earth and the universe! So we're working with Google and YouTube to
answer ten of the most popular questions searched for on the internet. This is the World's Most Asked Questions! [Intro] Today’s question is: How can I get rid of
hiccups? People have all kinds of hiccup remedies that
they swear by, none of which seem to have much to do with each other -- like, swallowing
a teaspoon of sugar, or guzzling a glass of water, or just holding your breath. But to figure out how to get rid of hiccups
-- and why we get them in the first place -- you gotta start with getting to know your
diaphragm. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle under your
lungs that is one of the most important muscles you have, if you enjoy things like breathing. And a hiccup is just an involuntary spasm
of the diaphragm that causes it to contract suddenly. When that happens, you take in a gulp of air
really quickly, until your vocal folds -- the membranes at the top of your throat -- clamp
shut. That’s what causes the “hic” sound. Most of the time, the spasm stops as quickly
as it started, and you can just say “excuse me” and get on with your life. But sometimes, those spasms won’t stop ... which
means it’s time to get your diaphragm to relax. To do this, you basically gotta hit the reset
button on your nervous system -- or at least the part that controls your diaphragm. You can do that in a couple of different ways. One is to stimulate your vagus nerve -- that's
a nerve that runs down your neck from the base of your brain, and it regulates some
of your body’s most important functions, including your heartbeat and your breathing. Basically, you need to stimulate this nerve
-- distract it, if you will -- so it’ll stop constantly zapping your diaphragm. So, some people have luck getting rid of hiccups
by swallowing a teaspoon of sugar. Sounds delicious, but it’s harder than it
sounds. The act of gulping down those dry granules
can provide just enough confusing stimulus for your vagus nerve to start focusing on
your throat, and leave your diaphragm alone. Another more common approach to kicking the
hiccups is to increase the level of carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. That might seem a little weird, but your natural
breathing rhythms are regulated by your CO2 levels, and if they get too high, your nervous
system will signal your diaphragm and lungs to make sure they’re doing their job. And this is what’s behind most of the hiccup-busting
techniques you’ve probably heard of -- like holding your breath, or breathing into a paper
bag, or drinking a tall glass of water. All of that stuff stops your intake of oxygen
and ramps up your internal CO2 concentration, which signals your diaphragm to get its head
in the game and fix things. If the human body weren't so weird, it wouldn't
be so fascinating. And speaking of hiccup cures, of those of
you who filled out our SciShow Survey, 54% said that holding your breath was your preferred
method for relieving hiccups, while at a close second was drinking water, at 37%. We're loving answering these questions, but
of all the questions in the world, what do YOU most want answered? Let us know on Facebook or Twitter or in the
comments down below, and we will answer the best questions in a new video at the end of
the month. Don’t forget to use the hashtag #WMAQ, for
World's Most Asked Questions, and stay tuned for more answers here on SciShow.

**Transcript**:
There are more than one and a half billion
people out there using the internet every day, and just like you, they're looking for
answers. We here at SciShow are looking for answers
too, answers to questions about science and nature and the human body, Earth and the universe! So we're working with Google and YouTube to
answer ten of the most popular questions searched for on the internet. This is the World's Most Asked Questions! [Intro] Today’s question is: How can I get rid of
hiccups? People have all kinds of hiccup remedies that
they swear by, none of which seem to have much to do with each other -- like, swallowing
a teaspoon of sugar, or guzzling a glass of water, or just holding your breath. But to figure out how to get rid of hiccups
-- and why we get them in the first place -- you gotta start with getting to know your
diaphragm. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle under your
lungs that is one of the most important muscles you have, if you enjoy things like breathing. And a hiccup is just an involuntary spasm
of the diaphragm that causes it to contract suddenly. When that happens, you take in a gulp of air
really quickly, until your vocal folds -- the membranes at the top of your throat -- clamp
shut. That’s what causes the “hic” sound. Most of the time, the spasm stops as quickly
as it started, and you can just say “excuse me” and get on with your life. But sometimes, those spasms won’t stop ... which
means it’s time to get your diaphragm to relax. To do this, you basically gotta hit the reset
button on your nervous system -- or at least the part that controls your diaphragm. You can do that in a couple of different ways. One is to stimulate your vagus nerve -- that's
a nerve that runs down your neck from the base of your brain, and it regulates some
of your body’s most important functions, including your heartbeat and your breathing. Basically, you need to stimulate this nerve
-- distract it, if you will -- so it’ll stop constantly zapping your diaphragm. So, some people have luck getting rid of hiccups
by swallowing a teaspoon of sugar. Sounds delicious, but it’s harder than it
sounds. The act of gulping down those dry granules
can provide just enough confusing stimulus for your vagus nerve to start focusing on
your throat, and leave your diaphragm alone. Another more common approach to kicking the
hiccups is to increase the level of carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. That might seem a little weird, but your natural
breathing rhythms are regulated by your CO2 levels, and if they get too high, your nervous
system will signal your diaphragm and lungs to make sure they’re doing their job. And this is what’s behind most of the hiccup-busting
techniques you’ve probably heard of -- like holding your breath, or breathing into a paper
bag, or drinking a tall glass of water. All of that stuff stops your intake of oxygen
and ramps up your internal CO2 concentration, which signals your diaphragm to get its head
in the game and fix things. If the human body weren't so weird, it wouldn't
be so fascinating. And speaking of hiccup cures, of those of
you who filled out our SciShow Survey, 54% said that holding your breath was your preferred
method for relieving hiccups, while at a close second was drinking water, at 37%. We're loving answering these questions, but
of all the questions in the world, what do YOU most want answered? Let us know on Facebook or Twitter or in the

**Transcript**:
[Music] Hey there, engineer buddies! I just want to thank you so much
for helping out in the last episode. I needed to get my phone out of the storm
drain, and together, we designed a solution. Our robot was just one of many possible solutions, and maybe you had an even better idea at home. If you did, please send it my way.
I'd love to check it out! But I've got a whole new challenge for you. Have you ever just wanted
some space to yourself? A place to relax, do your own thing,
eat Nutella straight off your fingers, and burp with abandon? Yeah, I need that.
That is a thing I need. You know what can help? I bet you already guessed it! Engineering. So how do we use the engineering
process to solve this problem? [Music] Well, first, we've got to define the problem. I need a place that is secluded and quiet. I need it to provide privacy
and a sense of my-ownness. Sounds pretty great, right? What about a big box to use as my space? It's secluded and it can be all my own. Solution-wise, it's a start, but a small one. We need to consider more options. What if I made adjustments to a
space I already have: my room? I could hang blankets from the ceiling
to help block out sounds from outside, and then I could also sing my
head off to T Swift if I wanted to without bothering the rest of my family. To top things off, I could add
a "Do Not Enter" sign to my door. Like, a serious sign. 
Bold font, all caps. Respect my sign! Okay, we've got two options. What else? What if instead of adjusting a space
I already have, I create a new space? There's a word for what we're
talking about here: architecture. Maybe we could become not just engineers,
but architects: engineers who design buildings. Even though the title of the job is a little
different, the process is still the same. So before doing architecture, we've got to weigh our options and choose
the best design to take into trials. Let's think about the box idea first. It's probably too small. I'd either be squished or
be half hanging out of it. Okay, how about tricking out my room? Again, while I'd feel like I have a sense
of privacy, I'd know that at any point, any one of my family members could bust in, and the blankets on the walls 
would muffle some of the sound, but wouldn't totally block them out. But hey, here's an idea:
what about a tree house? It would be totally my own, it would be far enough from my house that any weird burps or loud renditions
of "Shake It Off" wouldn't bug my family. Of course, it would take some
work. Some architecture work. So architect, activate!  [Music] Let's build the treehouse! It'll have a drop-down rope ladder that
I can pull up for optimal privacy, and it'll have windows so I can spot
when someone's on the way over and properly prepare myself. I can even use the blanket wall idea from
my second proposal to muffle the sound. Of course, I'll need space for lounging
and reading and dancing around, but before we start building,
you know what we've got to do? Build the prototype and test it. And in order to conduct useful trials,
we need to isolate the variables. What are the variables of
this particular mission? The size of the treehouse we choose
and the weight of the treehouse are really important variables
because we gotta make sure the treehouse can stay in the tree. What about variables when it comes
to soundproofing the thing? The number and the size of the
blankets that I use would be one, and so would be the amount of noise
I plan on making inside the treehouse. And we have to keep in
mind failure points, too. Like, the tree might be able to support
little old me in a small wooden tree house, but if I have a friend or two over,
the load might be too heavy. That would be a serious failure point. As for keeping things nice and quiet,
maybe my thickest heaviest blankets can block a soft rendition
of "You Belong With Me," but they might fail when I belt out
"Shake It Off" or have a burping contest. You've gotta test these things! So we'll keep working with the variables
until we've got a working design. Then, it's time to build. [Music] Architects use the same process,
the engineering process, when planning buildings from
skyscrapers to small family homes. I came up with what I think
will be a great treehouse, but as always, there can be lots
of different successful solutions. So here's your challenge: can you come
up with your own architecture solution? What would your building look like? How would it meet the success
criteria and navigate the variables? Let us know! [Music]

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: In the video, we see that one failure point is if she builds a treehouse, she may be able to stay in but can't have friends over. What is a failure point?
Options: A. A place where a solution to a problem fails., B. A place where a solution to a problem has limits., C. A place where a solution to a problem causes a collapse in the solution., D. A place where a solution to the problem causes another unknown variable.
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is one potential failure point that the speaker mentions when considering the weight capacity of the treehouse?
Options: A. The tree might not be able to support the weight of the treehouse., B. The tree might be able to support the weight of the treehouse, but not the weight of the people inside it., C. The tree might be able to support the weight of the people inside the treehouse, but not the weight of the treehouse itself., D. The treehouse might not be able to support the weight of the people inside it, but the tree itself can support the weight of the treehouse.
Correct Option: B

**Transcript**:
[Music] Hey there, engineer buddies! I just want to thank you so much
for helping out in the last episode. I needed to get my phone out of the storm
drain, and together, we designed a solution. Our robot was just one of many possible solutions, and maybe you had an even better idea at home. If you did, please send it my way.
I'd love to check it out! But I've got a whole new challenge for you. Have you ever just wanted
some space to yourself? A place to relax, do your own thing,
eat Nutella straight off your fingers, and burp with abandon? Yeah, I need that.
That is a thing I need. You know what can help? I bet you already guessed it! Engineering. So how do we use the engineering
process to solve this problem? [Music] Well, first, we've got to define the problem. I need a place that is secluded and quiet. I need it to provide privacy
and a sense of my-ownness. Sounds pretty great, right? What about a big box to use as my space? It's secluded and it can be all my own. Solution-wise, it's a start, but a small one. We need to consider more options. What if I made adjustments to a
space I already have: my room? I could hang blankets from the ceiling
to help block out sounds from outside, and then I could also sing my
head off to T Swift if I wanted to without bothering the rest of my family. To top things off, I could add
a "Do Not Enter" sign to my door. Like, a serious sign. 
Bold font, all caps. Respect my sign! Okay, we've got two options. What else? What if instead of adjusting a space
I already have, I create a new space? There's a word for what we're
talking about here: architecture. Maybe we could become not just engineers,
but architects: engineers who design buildings. Even though the title of the job is a little
different, the process is still the same. So before doing architecture, we've got to weigh our options and choose
the best design to take into trials. Let's think about the box idea first. It's probably too small. I'd either be squished or
be half hanging out of it. Okay, how about tricking out my room? Again, while I'd feel like I have a sense
of privacy, I'd know that at any point, any one of my family members could bust in, and the blankets on the walls 
would muffle some of the sound, but wouldn't totally block them out. But hey, here's an idea:
what about a tree house? It would be totally my own, it would be far enough from my house that any weird burps or loud renditions
of "Shake It Off" wouldn't bug my family. Of course, it would take some
work. Some architecture work. So architect, activate!  [Music] Let's build the treehouse! It'll have a drop-down rope ladder that
I can pull up for optimal privacy, and it'll have windows so I can spot
when someone's on the way over and properly prepare myself. I can even use the blanket wall idea from
my second proposal to muffle the sound. Of course, I'll need space for lounging
and reading and dancing around, but before we start building,
you know what we've got to do? Build the prototype and test it. And in order to conduct useful trials,
we need to isolate the variables. What are the variables of
this particular mission? The size of the treehouse we choose
and the weight of the treehouse are really important variables
because we gotta make sure the treehouse can stay in the tree. What about variables when it comes
to soundproofing the thing? The number and the size of the
blankets that I use would be one, and so would be the amount of noise
I plan on making inside the treehouse. And we have to keep in
mind failure points, too. Like, the tree might be able to support
little old me in a small wooden tree house, but if I have a friend or two over,
the load might be too heavy. That would be a serious failure point. As for keeping things nice and quiet,
maybe my thickest heaviest blankets can block a soft rendition
of "You Belong With Me," but they might fail when I belt out
"Shake It Off" or have a burping contest. You've gotta test these things! So we'll keep working with the variables
until we've got a working design. Then, it's time to build. [Music] Architects use the same process,
the engineering process, when planning buildings from
skyscrapers to small family homes. I came up with what I think
will be a great treehouse, but as always, there can be lots
of different successful solutions. So here's your challenge: can you come
up with your own architecture solution? What would your building look like? How would it meet the success
criteria and navigate the variables? Let us know! [Music]

Hey, today we are going to have fun with learning
about Black History and a man named Malcolm X. With Black History in the United States, many
African-Americans mention Malcolm X. Do you know who Malcolm X is? Malcolm X was an African-American Civil Rights
Activist and Minister. Right now we will learn a little bit about
his life. Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19,
1925 in Omaha, Nebraska. Malcolm was the fourth of eight children born
to Louise, a homemaker, and Earl Little, a preacher. His father spoke out against racism and was
often picked on by a group named the Ku Klux Klan. It was so bad the littles had to move from
Omaha and his father was later found murdered. After the death of Malcolm’s father, Malcolm's
mother became very sick and could not take care of her children. This is where Malcolm and his siblings were
placed in foster care. Seeing all of this Malcolm would get into
trouble later on finding himself in a juvenile detention center, and later on finding himself
in prison after getting in trouble. It was there his life would change when he
discovered a religion known as Islam. After choosing the religion of Islam and joining
the Nation of Islam, Malcolm Little would soon change his name from to Malcolm X, where
he would go on to be a well-known leader of the Nation of Islam. During this time another African-American
Civil Rights Activist was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Although Dr. King spoke about peaceful protests,
Malcolm X was known for saying, “By any means necessary,” and "You don't have to
have a peaceful revolution," when speaking against racism. Malcolm X would later leave the Nation of
Islam and become a traditional Muslim where he changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. Malcolm X’s life came to an end after he
was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York, New York. That is all for me and I hope you enjoyed
learning about Black History and Malcolm X a civil rights activist and preacher. I hope you had fun learning with F.R.E.S.B.E.R.G

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: While Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X approached the Civil Rights Movement differently, they did have two things in common. What were they?

Hey, today we are going to have fun with learning
about Black History and a man named Malcolm X. With Black History in the United States, many
African-Americans mention Malcolm X. Do you know who Malcolm X is? Malcolm X was an African-American Civil Rights
Activist and Minister. Right now we will learn a little bit about
his life. Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19,
1925 in Omaha, Nebraska. Malcolm was the fourth of eight children born
to Louise, a homemaker, and Earl Little, a preacher. His father spoke out against racism and was
often picked on by a group named the Ku Klux Klan. It was so bad the littles had to move from
Omaha and his father was later found murdered. After the death of Malcolm’s father, Malcolm's
mother became very sick and could not take care of her children. This is where Malcolm and his siblings were
placed in foster care. Seeing all of this Malcolm would get into
trouble later on finding himself in a juvenile detention center, and later on finding himself
in prison after getting in trouble. It was there his life would change when he
discovered a religion known as Islam. After choosing the religion of Islam and joining
the Nation of Islam, Malcolm Little would soon change his name from to Malcolm X, where
he would go on to be a well-known leader of the Nation of Islam. During this time another African-American
Civil Rights Activist was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Although Dr. King spoke about peaceful protests,
Malcolm X was known for saying, “By any means necessary,” and "You don't have to
have a peaceful revolution," when speaking against racism. Malcolm X would later leave the Nation of
Islam and become a traditional Muslim where he changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. Malcolm X’s life came to an end after he
was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York, New York. That is all for me and I hope you enjoyed

**Transcript**:
The evil wizard MoldeVort 
has been trying to kill you for years, and today it looks like 
he’s going to succeed. But your friends are on their way, 
and if you can survive until they arrive, they should be able to help stop him. The evil wizard’s protective charms 
ward off every spell you know, so in an act of desperation 
you throw the only object in reach at him: Pythagoras’s cursed chessboard. It works, but with a catch. MoldeVort starts in one corner 
of the 5x5 board. You have a few minutes to choose 
four distinct positive whole numbers. MoldeVort gets to say one of them, 
and if you can pick a square on the board whose center is exactly 
that distance away, the curse will force him 
to move to that spot. Then he’ll have to choose 
any of the four numbers, and the process repeats until 
you can’t keep him inside the board with legal moves. Then he’ll break free of the spell 
and almost certainly kill you. What four numbers can you choose 
to keep MoldeVort trapped by your spell long enough for help to arrive? 
And what’s your strategy? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to keep MoldeVort 
where you want him. And one way to figure out how to do that is to play out the game 
as MoldeVort would: always trying to escape. You’re dealing with a relatively 
small board, so the numbers can’t be too big. Let’s start by trying 1, 2, 3, 4 
to see what happens. Moldevort could escape those numbers
in just three moves. By saying 2, then 3, he would force you to let him into one
of the middle points of the grid, and then a 4 would break him free. But that means you’ll need to allow
a number larger than 4, which is the distance from one end 
of a row to another. How is that even possible? Through diagonal moves. There are, in fact, points that are 
distance 5 from each other, which we know thanks 
to the Pythagorean Theorem. That states that the squares 
of the sides of a right triangle add up to the square of its hypotenuse. One of the most famous 
Pythagorean triples is 3, 4, 5, and that triangle is hiding all over 
your chessboard. So if MoldeVort was here, and he said 5,
you could move him to these spaces. There’s another insight that will help. The board is very symmetrical: 
If MoldeVort is in a corner, it doesn’t really matter 
to you which corner it is. So we can think of the corners 
as being functionally the same, and color them all blue. Similarly, the spaces neighboring 
the corners behave the same as each other, and we’ll make them red. Finally, the midpoints of the sides 
are a third type. So instead of having to develop a strategy for each of the 16 spaces 
on the outside of the board, we can reduce the problem to just three. Meanwhile, all the inside spaces 
are bad for us, because if MoldeVort ever reaches one, he’ll be able to say any number 
larger than 3 and go free. Orange spaces are trouble too, 
since any number except 1, 2, or 4 would take him to an inside space 
or off the board. So orange is out and you’ll need 
to keep him on blue and red. That means 2 is bad, since it could take MoldeVort 
to orange on the first turn. But the four other smallest numbers, 
1, 3, 4, and 5, might work. Let’s try them and see what happens. If MoldeVort says 1, you can make 
him go from blue to red or red to blue. And the same works if he says 3. Thanks to our diagonals, 
this is even true if he says 5. If he says 4, you can keep him 
on the color he’s already on by moving the length of a row or column. So these four numbers work! Even if your friends don’t get here 
right away, you’ll be able to keep 
the world’s most evil wizard contained for as long as you need.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The evil wizard MoldeVort 
has been trying to kill you for years, and today it looks like 
he’s going to succeed. But your friends are on their way, 
and if you can survive until they arrive, they should be able to help stop him. The evil wizard’s protective charms 
ward off every spell you know, so in an act of desperation 
you throw the only object in reach at him: Pythagoras’s cursed chessboard. It works, but with a catch. MoldeVort starts in one corner 
of the 5x5 board. You have a few minutes to choose 
four distinct positive whole numbers. MoldeVort gets to say one of them, 
and if you can pick a square on the board whose center is exactly 
that distance away, the curse will force him 
to move to that spot. Then he’ll have to choose 
any of the four numbers, and the process repeats until 
you can’t keep him inside the board with legal moves. Then he’ll break free of the spell 
and almost certainly kill you. What four numbers can you choose 
to keep MoldeVort trapped by your spell long enough for help to arrive? 
And what’s your strategy? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to keep MoldeVort 
where you want him. And one way to figure out how to do that is to play out the game 
as MoldeVort would: always trying to escape. You’re dealing with a relatively 
small board, so the numbers can’t be too big. Let’s start by trying 1, 2, 3, 4 
to see what happens. Moldevort could escape those numbers
in just three moves. By saying 2, then 3, he would force you to let him into one
of the middle points of the grid, and then a 4 would break him free. But that means you’ll need to allow
a number larger than 4, which is the distance from one end 
of a row to another. How is that even possible? Through diagonal moves. There are, in fact, points that are 
distance 5 from each other, which we know thanks 
to the Pythagorean Theorem. That states that the squares 
of the sides of a right triangle add up to the square of its hypotenuse. One of the most famous 
Pythagorean triples is 3, 4, 5, and that triangle is hiding all over 
your chessboard. So if MoldeVort was here, and he said 5,
you could move him to these spaces. There’s another insight that will help. The board is very symmetrical: 
If MoldeVort is in a corner, it doesn’t really matter 
to you which corner it is. So we can think of the corners 
as being functionally the same, and color them all blue. Similarly, the spaces neighboring 
the corners behave the same as each other, and we’ll make them red. Finally, the midpoints of the sides 
are a third type. So instead of having to develop a strategy for each of the 16 spaces 
on the outside of the board, we can reduce the problem to just three. Meanwhile, all the inside spaces 
are bad for us, because if MoldeVort ever reaches one, he’ll be able to say any number 
larger than 3 and go free. Orange spaces are trouble too, 
since any number except 1, 2, or 4 would take him to an inside space 
or off the board. So orange is out and you’ll need 
to keep him on blue and red. That means 2 is bad, since it could take MoldeVort 
to orange on the first turn. But the four other smallest numbers, 
1, 3, 4, and 5, might work. Let’s try them and see what happens. If MoldeVort says 1, you can make 
him go from blue to red or red to blue. And the same works if he says 3. Thanks to our diagonals, 
this is even true if he says 5. If he says 4, you can keep him 
on the color he’s already on by moving the length of a row or column. So these four numbers work! Even if your friends don’t get here 
right away, you’ll be able to keep 
the world’s most evil wizard contained for as long as you need.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How can MoldeVort get free?
Options: A. If he can overpower the spell with magical strength., B. If he can’t make a legal move without going off the board or off the center of a square., C. If he finds the enchanted chess pieces., D. If he can reverse the spell using a symmetry spell.
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the consequence of the evil wizard reaching an inside space on the board?

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A new virus emerges 
and spreads like wildfire. In order to contain it, researchers must first collect data 
about who’s been infected. Two main viral testing techniques 
are critical: one tells you if you have the virus and the other shows 
if you’ve already had it. So, how exactly do these tests work? PCR, or polymerase chain 
reaction testing, targets the virus’s genetic material 
in the body and is used to diagnose someone 
who is currently infected. Yet, this genetic material may be present 
in such imperceptible amounts that actually detecting it is difficult. This is where PCR comes in: it’s widely used to amplify genetic 
information to large enough quantities that it can be readily observed. To develop a PCR test 
for a never-before-seen virus, researchers first sequence 
its genetic material, or genome, and identify regions that are unique 
to that specific virus. PCR then targets 
these particular segments. A PCR test begins by collecting a sample: this can be blood for hepatitis viruses, 
feces for poliovirus, and samples from the nose or throat 
for coronaviruses. The sample is taken 
to a central laboratory where PCR is performed to test 
for the presence of the virus’ genome. Genetic information can be encoded 
via DNA or RNA. HPV, for example, uses DNA, 
while SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, uses RNA. Before running the PCR, 
the viral RNA— if present— must be reverse transcribed 
to make a strand of complementary DNA. Researchers then run the PCR. If the virus is present in the sample, 
its unique regions of genetic code will be identified by complementary 
primers and copied by enzymes. One strand of DNA becomes 
hundreds of millions, which are detected using probes marked
with fluorescent dye. If the PCR machine senses fluorescence, the sample has tested positive 
for the virus, meaning the individual is infected. Immunoassays, on the other hand, tap into the immune system’s 
memory of the virus, showing if someone has previously 
been infected. They work by targeting virus-specific
antibodies generated by the immune system during infection. These are specialized classes of proteins that identify and fight foreign 
substances, like viruses. Immunoassays may detect IgG antibodies, 
the most abundant class, and IgM antibodies, the type that’s first 
produced in response to a new infection. The presence of IgM antibodies suggests 
a recent infection, but since it can take the body over 
a week to produce a detectable amount, they’re unreliable in diagnosing 
current infections. Meanwhile, IgG antibodies circulate 
for an extended period after infection; their presence usually indicates 
that someone was exposed and recovered. Before the immunoassay, health professionals draw blood 
from an individual. This sample then comes into contact 
with a portion of the virus of interest. If the body has, in fact, been exposed 
to the virus in the past, the body’s virus-specific antibodies 
will bind to it during the test. This reaction produces a change in color, 
indicating that the sample tested positive and that the individual has been 
exposed to the virus. Immunoassays are especially important when it comes to retroactively 
diagnosing people who were infected but went untested. And there’s exciting potential for those
who have developed immunity to a virus: in some cases, their blood plasma 
could be used as treatment in people who are currently fighting it. PCR and immunoassays are always 
in the process of becoming more accurate and efficient. For example, innovations in PCR have led to the use
of self-contained testing devices that relay results within one hour. Digital PCR, which quantifies individual 
pieces of target DNA, shows promise in further
boosting accuracy. And although immunoassays are difficult 
to develop quickly, researchers in Singapore were able 
to create one for SARS-CoV-2 even before COVID-19 was declared 
a pandemic. These tests— along with the scientists 
who develop them and the health professionals 
who administer them— are absolutely essential. And when deployed early, 
they can save millions of lives.

are some of the world’s scariest viruses. Hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola are extremely
fatal – they kill up to 90 percent of people infected – while SARS, a coronavirus, has
a lower mortality rate but spreads incredibly rapidly. All of these nasty pathogens have
surfaced in humans in just the last 50 years, and they are all carried by bats. Which, to be clear, really isn’t bats’
fault: the recent rise in outbreaks is likely due to humans and our animals creeping ever-farther
into bats’ territory, especially in the tropics. In Malaysia, for example, the spread
of commercial pig farms into bat-inhabited forests led to the first human outbreak - via
pigs - of Nipah. And in Australia, human hendra cases are cropping up as destruction native
forests forces fruit bats to feed in suburban gardens. But still: bats do appear to carry more human-killing
diseases than pretty much any other animal. One big reason is that, with a few notable
exceptions, bats love company  — different kinds of bats  often roost together in huge
numbers and close quarters, which helps viruses spread not just between individuals, but also
between species . What’s more, most infected bats don’t
die — they live pretty normal bat lives,  flapping around and giving the viruses time
to spread. In fact, flight may be the reason bats are so resilient to infection. As a rule, mammals can’t produce the immense
amount of energy needed for flight without also producing a lot of reactive waste products
that damage our DNA. So when our bat cousins took to the air, they leveled-up their in-flight
DNA damage repair kits and other defenses, including specialized cells that keep viral
invaders in check. So bats can survive the deadly viruses - but
what may matter even more, for humans anyway, is how the viruses survive the bats. Nasty as they are, most viruses are also extremely
finicky — in order to thrive, they require the perfectly controlled climate inside a
normal, resting, on-the-ground mammal. But when bats take to the air, their internal
temperatures cruise to around 40°C. Those frequent in-flight saunas are far too toasty
for your average virus, but a few hardy viruses have evolved to tolerate the heat.  Which,
incidentally, means they can definitely weather a meager human fever. Essentially, flight
may have helped bats gain virtual immunity to viruses AND trained viruses to be virtually
immune to us. Stupid flying. So, what should we land-lubbers do? We need
bats for insect control and pollination - and a whole bunch of other things - maybe we could
even learn some immune tricks from them - like how to be really good at not getting cancer!
Plus, bats aren’t the biggest carriers of human disease. Humans are - just do the math.
Perhaps we’d be better off leaving bats alone, and trying to control the spread of
diseases carried by a different kind of flying mammal.

**Transcript**:
For almost a decade, scientists chased 
the source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains 
and most isolated caverns. They finally found it here: 
in the bats of Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes 
that look like a crown— or "corona" in Latin. There are hundreds 
of known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, 
and can cause disease. The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, 
MERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes 
the disease COVID-19. Of the seven human coronaviruses, 
four cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections 
of the nose and throat. Two infect the lungs, 
and cause much more severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID-19, 
has features of each: it spreads easily, 
but can severely impact the lungs. When an infected person coughs, 
droplets containing the virus spray out. The virus can infect a new person when
the droplets enter their nose or mouth. Coronaviruses transmit best 
in enclosed spaces, where people are close together. Cold weather keeps their delicate casing
from drying out, enabling the virus to survive 
for longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight 
may damage it. These seasonal variations matter more 
for established viruses. But because no one is yet immune 
to a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it
doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread. In the body, the protein spikes embed
in the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack 
the host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes. Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA. All viruses are either RNA viruses 
or DNA viruses. RNA viruses tend to be smaller, 
with fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts 
and replicate quickly in those hosts. In general, RNA viruses don’t have 
a proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do. So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have 
mistakes called mutations. Many of these mutations are useless 
or even harmful. But some make the virus better suited
for certain environments— like a new host species. Epidemics often occur when a virus 
jumps from animals to humans. This is true of the RNA viruses 
that caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, 
and the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, 
or strains, of the original one. Coronaviruses have a few key differences 
from most RNA viruses. They’re some of the largest, 
meaning they have the most genes. That creates more opportunity 
for harmful mutations. To counteract this risk, 
coronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication 
errors and corrects mistakes. This makes coronaviruses 
much more stable, with a slower mutation rate, 
than other RNA viruses. While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate 
is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them. After an infection, our immune systems 
can recognize germs and destroy them more quickly 
if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick. But mutations can make a virus 
less recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can also make antiviral drugs 
and vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored 
very specifically to a virus. That’s why we need a new flu vaccine
every year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly 
that new strains pop up constantly. The slower mutation rate 
of coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, 
and vaccines might be able to recognize them 
for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. Still, we don’t know how long our bodies
remain immune to different coronaviruses. There’s never been an approved treatment
or vaccine for a coronavirus. We haven’t focused on treating 
the ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing
treatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those 
treatments completed clinical trials. As we continue to encroach 
on other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus 
jumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, 
it doesn’t have to be devastating.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Coronaviruses are a bit different from other RNA viruses. How?
Options: A. They are quite large with many genes, B. They are usually much more stable, C. They often have a faster mutation rate, D. A and b are both answers, E. All of the above are answers
Correct Option: D

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
For almost a decade, scientists chased 
the source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains 
and most isolated caverns. They finally found it here: 
in the bats of Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes 
that look like a crown— or "corona" in Latin. There are hundreds 
of known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, 
and can cause disease. The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, 
MERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes 
the disease COVID-19. Of the seven human coronaviruses, 
four cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections 
of the nose and throat. Two infect the lungs, 
and cause much more severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID-19, 
has features of each: it spreads easily, 
but can severely impact the lungs. When an infected person coughs, 
droplets containing the virus spray out. The virus can infect a new person when
the droplets enter their nose or mouth. Coronaviruses transmit best 
in enclosed spaces, where people are close together. Cold weather keeps their delicate casing
from drying out, enabling the virus to survive 
for longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight 
may damage it. These seasonal variations matter more 
for established viruses. But because no one is yet immune 
to a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it
doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread. In the body, the protein spikes embed
in the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack 
the host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes. Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA. All viruses are either RNA viruses 
or DNA viruses. RNA viruses tend to be smaller, 
with fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts 
and replicate quickly in those hosts. In general, RNA viruses don’t have 
a proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do. So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have 
mistakes called mutations. Many of these mutations are useless 
or even harmful. But some make the virus better suited
for certain environments— like a new host species. Epidemics often occur when a virus 
jumps from animals to humans. This is true of the RNA viruses 
that caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, 
and the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, 
or strains, of the original one. Coronaviruses have a few key differences 
from most RNA viruses. They’re some of the largest, 
meaning they have the most genes. That creates more opportunity 
for harmful mutations. To counteract this risk, 
coronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication 
errors and corrects mistakes. This makes coronaviruses 
much more stable, with a slower mutation rate, 
than other RNA viruses. While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate 
is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them. After an infection, our immune systems 
can recognize germs and destroy them more quickly 
if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick. But mutations can make a virus 
less recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can also make antiviral drugs 
and vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored 
very specifically to a virus. That’s why we need a new flu vaccine
every year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly 
that new strains pop up constantly. The slower mutation rate 
of coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, 
and vaccines might be able to recognize them 
for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. Still, we don’t know how long our bodies
remain immune to different coronaviruses. There’s never been an approved treatment
or vaccine for a coronavirus. We haven’t focused on treating 
the ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing
treatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those 
treatments completed clinical trials. As we continue to encroach 
on other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus 
jumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, 
it doesn’t have to be devastating.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 10, Ground Truth Question 6, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
For almost a decade, scientists chased 
the source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains 
and most isolated caverns. They finally found it here: 
in the bats of Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes 
that look like a crown— or "corona" in Latin. There are hundreds 
of known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, 
and can cause disease. The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, 
MERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes 
the disease COVID-19. Of the seven human coronaviruses, 
four cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections 
of the nose and throat. Two infect the lungs, 
and cause much more severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID-19, 
has features of each: it spreads easily, 
but can severely impact the lungs. When an infected person coughs, 
droplets containing the virus spray out. The virus can infect a new person when
the droplets enter their nose or mouth. Coronaviruses transmit best 
in enclosed spaces, where people are close together. Cold weather keeps their delicate casing
from drying out, enabling the virus to survive 
for longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight 
may damage it. These seasonal variations matter more 
for established viruses. But because no one is yet immune 
to a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it
doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread. In the body, the protein spikes embed
in the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack 
the host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes. Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA. All viruses are either RNA viruses 
or DNA viruses. RNA viruses tend to be smaller, 
with fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts 
and replicate quickly in those hosts. In general, RNA viruses don’t have 
a proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do. So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have 
mistakes called mutations. Many of these mutations are useless 
or even harmful. But some make the virus better suited
for certain environments— like a new host species. Epidemics often occur when a virus 
jumps from animals to humans. This is true of the RNA viruses 
that caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, 
and the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, 
or strains, of the original one. Coronaviruses have a few key differences 
from most RNA viruses. They’re some of the largest, 
meaning they have the most genes. That creates more opportunity 
for harmful mutations. To counteract this risk, 
coronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication 
errors and corrects mistakes. This makes coronaviruses 
much more stable, with a slower mutation rate, 
than other RNA viruses. While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate 
is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them. After an infection, our immune systems 
can recognize germs and destroy them more quickly 
if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick. But mutations can make a virus 
less recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can also make antiviral drugs 
and vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored 
very specifically to a virus. That’s why we need a new flu vaccine
every year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly 
that new strains pop up constantly. The slower mutation rate 
of coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, 
and vaccines might be able to recognize them 
for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. Still, we don’t know how long our bodies
remain immune to different coronaviruses. There’s never been an approved treatment
or vaccine for a coronavirus. We haven’t focused on treating 
the ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing
treatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those 
treatments completed clinical trials. As we continue to encroach 
on other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus 
jumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, 
it doesn’t have to be devastating.

**Transcript**:
[Music] Not everybody likes the same kind of food, right? That's probably a good thing. 
I mean, all the more pizza for me! But whether we eat milkshakes or mangoes, 
pizzas or pears, tacos or toast, we use the energy that's in 
our food to stay alive. But how did that energy get
 into our food in the first place? The answer is that energy 
flows between living things. It's almost like each form of food 
is a link in a chain...a food chain! You might have heard that humans are on the top of the food chain because we eat pretty much everything, and except for the occasional 
video game monster and maybe the odd bear, 
nothing tries to eat us. But what is a food chain, exactly? A food chain is a model that shows 
how energy flows between living things. You can think of animals and plants in the same food chain as all living in the same neighborhood, 
which scientists call a "habitat." And they all have a job to do, 
interacting with each other, day in and day out. Together, they form a kind of system. A self-contained collection of different things 
that all work together as a whole. And, they also interact with the 
non-living stuff around them, like the water, the air, the ground, and the sun. Put it all together, and what do you get? A special system 
called an "ecosystem!" And food chains show us 
what eats what in an ecosystem. Now, everything that's alive is in a food chain. Including you, my friend! And actually, most living things 
are in more than one food chain, depending on what, or who, 
they're munching on at the moment. I mean, you don't eat the same thing 
for dinner every night, do you? Didn't think so! Now, let's see how a food chain works, by making a diagram of how 
these interactions happen in nature. First, all of the energy that's 
in a food chain starts with the Sun. I can't stress that enough, people! Plants take the energy from the Sun's rays and change it into chemical energy. So, when a nice patch of 
lush, green grass starts to grow, it's capturing some of the energy 
from the Sun to do it. Then when an animal, like a rabbit, 
wanders by and nibbles on that grass, the energy from the plant is 
transferred into the rabbit's body. Now, if hungry hawk decides that the 
rabbit would make a yummy supper, then the energy from the rabbit 
is transferred to the hawk. And in this ecosystem, nothing is large 
or brave enough to take on the hawk. I mean, just look at her! So, we've hit the top of the food chain, and we've just made a nifty model of it. So, a food chain is a model that shows how energy flows between living things in an ecosystem. Energy in a food chain starts with the Sun, which is turned into chemical energy by plants. And this energy moves up the food chain 
as animals eat the plants, and then other animals eat those animals. And speaking of energy, I'm starving! So I'm off to take my place in the food chain. See you next time!

**Transcript**:
[Music] Not everybody likes the same kind of food, right? That's probably a good thing. 
I mean, all the more pizza for me! But whether we eat milkshakes or mangoes, 
pizzas or pears, tacos or toast, we use the energy that's in 
our food to stay alive. But how did that energy get
 into our food in the first place? The answer is that energy 
flows between living things. It's almost like each form of food 
is a link in a chain...a food chain! You might have heard that humans are on the top of the food chain because we eat pretty much everything, and except for the occasional 
video game monster and maybe the odd bear, 
nothing tries to eat us. But what is a food chain, exactly? A food chain is a model that shows 
how energy flows between living things. You can think of animals and plants in the same food chain as all living in the same neighborhood, 
which scientists call a "habitat." And they all have a job to do, 
interacting with each other, day in and day out. Together, they form a kind of system. A self-contained collection of different things 
that all work together as a whole. And, they also interact with the 
non-living stuff around them, like the water, the air, the ground, and the sun. Put it all together, and what do you get? A special system 
called an "ecosystem!" And food chains show us 
what eats what in an ecosystem. Now, everything that's alive is in a food chain. Including you, my friend! And actually, most living things 
are in more than one food chain, depending on what, or who, 
they're munching on at the moment. I mean, you don't eat the same thing 
for dinner every night, do you? Didn't think so! Now, let's see how a food chain works, by making a diagram of how 
these interactions happen in nature. First, all of the energy that's 
in a food chain starts with the Sun. I can't stress that enough, people! Plants take the energy from the Sun's rays and change it into chemical energy. So, when a nice patch of 
lush, green grass starts to grow, it's capturing some of the energy 
from the Sun to do it. Then when an animal, like a rabbit, 
wanders by and nibbles on that grass, the energy from the plant is 
transferred into the rabbit's body. Now, if hungry hawk decides that the 
rabbit would make a yummy supper, then the energy from the rabbit 
is transferred to the hawk. And in this ecosystem, nothing is large 
or brave enough to take on the hawk. I mean, just look at her! So, we've hit the top of the food chain, and we've just made a nifty model of it. So, a food chain is a model that shows how energy flows between living things in an ecosystem. Energy in a food chain starts with the Sun, which is turned into chemical energy by plants. And this energy moves up the food chain 
as animals eat the plants, and then other animals eat those animals. And speaking of energy, I'm starving! So I'm off to take my place in the food chain. See you next time!

[ ♪ Intro ♪ ] It’s that time again! I’m getting a haircut later today. lots of people get them   Sometimes people decide to cut their hair
much shorter, and sometimes they just get a trim, like I am. Even Squeaks had a little trim when he got
a piece of gum stuck his fur, remember, Squeaks? [Squeaks squeaks] But there’s something that all haircuts
have in common: They don’t hurt! When you think about it, it might seem kind
of weird that they don’t. I mean, if you get a cut on almost any other
part of your body, like your finger, it definitely hurts! But when someone cuts your hair, as long as
you hold very still, it doesn’t hurt at all! There’s also another place on our bodies
that it doesn’t hurt to cut, and we do it all the time. Can you guess what it is, Squeaks? [Squeaks guesses] That’s right — our nails! The reason it doesn’t hurt to cut your hair,
toenails, or fingernails is that they don’t have nerves inside them. A nerve is a type of body part you have all
over the inside of your body, kind of like how you have muscles all over. These nerves have a special job to do: they
carry messages between different places in your body. Now, you have lots of body parts. So nerves have lots of jobs. But one of the biggest jobs nerves have is
to help you sense the world around you. Nerves are the reason you can see, hear, smell,
taste … and yes, feel things! Nerves are a big part of the sense of touch. Squeaks, can I touch your nose to show how
this works? [Squeaks squeaks] When you touch something [taps Squeaks on
the nose], it brushes up against your skin. And, like most parts of your body, your skin
has nerves in it. When something touches your skin, it activates,
or kind of ‘turns on’ the nerves. These nerves can feel all kinds of different
things. Some of them feel whether something is warm
or cold. Others can help us tell if something is smooth
or rough. And there are also some that are in charge
of sensing pain. When I tap Squeaks’ nose, some of the nerves
in my finger get switched on, and each one sends a message. Those messages travel through my hands … up
my arm … through a big bundle of nerves that’s in my back … and all the way to
my brain! Then, my brain decodes the messages. It checks if I’ve ever touched anything
like this before, and combines that with any other information it can get, like if I can
see the thing I’m feeling. This all happens really fast, which is how
I can figure out what I’m touching right away — Squeaks’ nose! [Squeaks sneezes] Oh, I’m sorry ! I guess your nose is kinda
ticklish, Squeaks! So, our sense of touch takes more than just
our hands. It also takes our nerves, and our brains,
too! But what about our hair? Well, try this. Pat the top of your head. Just like the skin that’s on your fingers,
the skin that’s under your hair has nerves. So your fingers can feel the top of your head,
and your head can feel your fingers touching it! Just like how Squeaks felt my finger with
his nose. Now find the very end of a piece of hair and
try squeezing it, without pulling on it at all. Your fingers can feel your hair, but your
hair can’t feel your fingers! That’s because there are no nerves inside
your hair. And as long as you’re not pulling on your
hair, or moving it around too much, you’re not going to feel a thing. The same goes for the very ends of your fingernails
and toenails. They don’t have nerves in them either. No nerves means no sense of touch, so they
don’t feel anything. And if there’s no sense of touch, there’s
no pain. So the next time you get a haircut, now you’ll
know why it doesn’t hurt! [Squeaks squeaks] Yikes, you’re right Squeaks — I should
go if I don’t want to be late for my haircut! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun

♪INTRO♪ Hey, Squeaks... (Squeaks squeaks) Oh, I'm ok. My leg just feels kinda weird... It’s tingling, but in a way that feels prickly! [Squeaks Squeaks] Oh yeah, you're right! I think my leg is asleep! Maybe this has happened to you before, too. Sometimes if you’ve been doing something
that presses on your arms or legs for a while, like sitting in one position or leaning on
your elbow, it’ll start to go numb and you can’t feel as much with that part of your
body. Then, once you move so you’re not sitting
or leaning that way anymore, your arm or leg starts to get all prickly, almost like you’re
getting lots of tiny pokes all over, even though there’s nothing actually poking you. People sometimes call that feeling pins and
needles. And that sounds a lot like what happened to
me! It’s something that can feel pretty weird,
even though it happens to people all the time. When we say that an arm or leg fell asleep,
we don’t really mean that it was asleep the way you are when you fall asleep at night. It’s just called that because you can’t
feel much with it while it’s numb, almost like it’s sleeping. And that tingling, pins and needles feeling
you get when you shift your position is kind of like your arm or leg is waking up! You get that prickly feeling because your
body is a little bit confused. You might already know that there’s blood
moving everywhere in your body all the time, pumped through little tubes called blood vessels
by your heart. It’s really important that the blood moves
through all the parts of your body, because that’s how they get energy so they can work
properly. But when you sit in one position or lean on
your arm or leg for a while, you’re pressing on those blood vessels and making the tubes
smaller, so not as much blood can get through. And without enough blood, your arm or leg
can start to go numb. The reason you can feel something when you
touch it is because of little things called nerves that are all over your body. Whenever you pick up a toy or touch something
that’s hot or cold or hurts, these nerves are like little messengers that tell your
brain all about what you’re touching. But the nerves only work well if they’re
getting enough blood. I must have sat in a way that was pressing
on his leg for a few minutes, the nerves in my leg weren’t getting enough blood. So my leg stopped being able to feel as much
— it went numb and fell asleep. But then I moved! And once my body wasn’t pressing on his
leg anymore, more blood started moving through it again and his nerves woke up. But nerves get a liiiittle confused when they
wake up. At first, they don’t really know /what/
you’re feeling. They start telling your brain that you’re
feeling tiny little pokes, even though nothing is really touching you! That’s where the pins and needles feeling
comes from. Pretty soon, your nerves get used to having
enough blood again and go right back to normal. So to keep yourself from getting pins and
needles, you can just make sure you don’t sit or lean in one position for too long. And if you do get them, all you have to do
is just wait. You can shake around the arm or leg in the
meantime to help the blood get flowing again, but either way, the prickling will go away
after a minute or two. Whew, Squeaks! It feels like my nerves are finally getting
back to normal! My leg is better now! But now the next time I get pins and needles,
I’ll know all about why it happens. And so will you! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun

**Transcript**:
♪INTRO♪ Hey, Squeaks... (Squeaks squeaks) Oh, I'm ok. My leg just feels kinda weird... It’s tingling, but in a way that feels prickly! [Squeaks Squeaks] Oh yeah, you're right! I think my leg is asleep! Maybe this has happened to you before, too. Sometimes if you’ve been doing something
that presses on your arms or legs for a while, like sitting in one position or leaning on
your elbow, it’ll start to go numb and you can’t feel as much with that part of your
body. Then, once you move so you’re not sitting
or leaning that way anymore, your arm or leg starts to get all prickly, almost like you’re
getting lots of tiny pokes all over, even though there’s nothing actually poking you. People sometimes call that feeling pins and
needles. And that sounds a lot like what happened to
me! It’s something that can feel pretty weird,
even though it happens to people all the time. When we say that an arm or leg fell asleep,
we don’t really mean that it was asleep the way you are when you fall asleep at night. It’s just called that because you can’t
feel much with it while it’s numb, almost like it’s sleeping. And that tingling, pins and needles feeling
you get when you shift your position is kind of like your arm or leg is waking up! You get that prickly feeling because your
body is a little bit confused. You might already know that there’s blood
moving everywhere in your body all the time, pumped through little tubes called blood vessels
by your heart. It’s really important that the blood moves
through all the parts of your body, because that’s how they get energy so they can work
properly. But when you sit in one position or lean on
your arm or leg for a while, you’re pressing on those blood vessels and making the tubes
smaller, so not as much blood can get through. And without enough blood, your arm or leg
can start to go numb. The reason you can feel something when you
touch it is because of little things called nerves that are all over your body. Whenever you pick up a toy or touch something
that’s hot or cold or hurts, these nerves are like little messengers that tell your
brain all about what you’re touching. But the nerves only work well if they’re
getting enough blood. I must have sat in a way that was pressing
on his leg for a few minutes, the nerves in my leg weren’t getting enough blood. So my leg stopped being able to feel as much
— it went numb and fell asleep. But then I moved! And once my body wasn’t pressing on his
leg anymore, more blood started moving through it again and his nerves woke up. But nerves get a liiiittle confused when they
wake up. At first, they don’t really know /what/
you’re feeling. They start telling your brain that you’re
feeling tiny little pokes, even though nothing is really touching you! That’s where the pins and needles feeling
comes from. Pretty soon, your nerves get used to having
enough blood again and go right back to normal. So to keep yourself from getting pins and
needles, you can just make sure you don’t sit or lean in one position for too long. And if you do get them, all you have to do
is just wait. You can shake around the arm or leg in the
meantime to help the blood get flowing again, but either way, the prickling will go away
after a minute or two. Whew, Squeaks! It feels like my nerves are finally getting
back to normal! My leg is better now! But now the next time I get pins and needles,
I’ll know all about why it happens. And so will you! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun
with Squeaks and me, hit the subscribe button, and we’ll see you next time here at the
Fort! ♪Outro♪
