Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Dialogue gives a story color, makes it exciting and moves it forward. Romeo: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? Juliet: What satisfaction canst thou have tonight? Romeo: The exchange of thy love's faithful vows for mine. Without dialogue: (cricket sounds) So what goes into writing effective dialogue? Well, there are social skills: making friends, solving conflicts, being pleasant and polite. We won't be using any of those today. Instead, we'll be working on -- let's call them "anti-social skills." If you're a writer, you may already have a few of these. The first is eavesdropping. If you're riding a bus and hear an interesting conversation, you could write it all down. Of course, when you write fiction, you're not describing real people, you're making up characters. But sometimes the words you overhear can give you ideas. "I did not," says one person. "I saw you," the other replies. Who might be saying those words? Maybe it's two kids in a class, and the boy thinks the girl pushed him. Maybe it's a couple, but one of them is a vampire, and the woman vampire saw the man flirting with a zombie. Or maybe not. Maybe the characters are a teenager and his mother, and they're supposed to be vegetarians, but the mother saw him eating a burger. So let's say you've decided on some characters. This is anti-social skill number two: start pretending they're real. What are they like? Where are they from? What music do they listen to? Spend some time with them. If you're on a bus, think about what they might be doing if they were there too. Would they talk on the phone, listen to music, draw pictures, sleep? What we say depends on who we are. An older person might speak differently than a younger person. Someone from the south might speak differently than someone from the north. Once you know your characters, you can figure out how they talk. At this stage, it's helpful to use anti-social skill number three: muttering to yourself. When you speak your character's words, you can hear whether they sound natural, and fix them if necessary. Remember, most people are usually pretty informal when they speak. They use simple language and contractions. So, "Do not attempt to lie to me" sounds more natural as "Don't try to lie to me." Also keep it short. People tend to speak in short bursts, not lengthy speeches. And let the dialogue do the work. Ask yourself: do I really need that adverb? For instance, "'Your money or your life,' she said threateningly." Here, "threateningly" is redundant, so you can get rid of it. But if the words and the actions don't match, an adverb can be helpful. "'Your money or your life,' she said lovingly." So, to recap: First, eavesdrop. Next, pretend imaginary people are real. Finally, mutter to yourself, and write it all down. You already have everything you need. This is fictional dialogue, or "How to Hear Voices in Your Head."

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You step into an elevator. It starts going down, fast. What would happen if you jumped right when it started going down? Would the ceiling hit your head? Ouch! Do you stay suspended in the air while the elevator plummets down? Let's examine the elevator problem one step at a time. First, consider a scale. You know, the kind of scale you weigh yourself on. When you step on a scale to weigh yourself, there are two forces involved. One, gravity pulls you down. Two, the scale pushes you up. What? You didn't know a scale could push? Of course it can! If it didn't push up on you, you would go crashing through the floor. This upward push is called the normal force and yes, it is normally there. Since you're just standing there on the scale, you're not moving. Therefore, you're not accelerating. Newton's second law of motion -- net force equals mass times acceleration -- tells us that if the acceleration equals zero, the net force must equal zero. Which means that the force of gravity pulling you down must be equal to the force of the scale pushing you up. Now let's suppose you're standing on that scale in an elevator. At first, the elevator is standing still, so you and the scale are standing still. The two forces on you are equal and opposite. You can read how hard the scale is pushing by looking at it. We call that your weight. Then, the elevator starts falling down. You and the scale are in the elevator, so you are falling down too, faster and faster. That means you are accelerating downward. Now there is a net force in the same direction as the acceleration -- down. Since gravity hasn't changed, that must mean the scale isn't pushing up as hard. So the scale is reading a smaller number. The faster the elevator accelerates, the less the scale pushes up. What if you jumped? Would you stop falling? Would the elevator hit your head? Well, what's pulling the elevator down? Gravity. Is gravity pulling on you? Of course. So your relative position in the elevator will stay the same. The ceiling will only hit you if you can jump up to the ceiling. Now consider: what would happen if the elevator accelerated upward and, even more frightening, if someone snuck in and cut the cable holding the elevator, what would happen then? Think about it.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I identified the most similar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about another example of something that affects how our weight appears on a scale because of the force of gravity and the normal force. The correct option is "Both A and B", which refers to standing on a scale on an airplane that is taking off from the runway and standing on a scale in the International Space Station.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 is the most similar, as it discusses how the elevator's acceleration affects the scale reading. However, it does not provide another example like the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
 So why does this turn
into this in the fall? I live in Boston, which
means that about this time each year, the
leaves on the trees start to turn their colors. Leaves get their color
from three main compounds. The first is chlorophyll,
which might sound familiar. Chlorophyll is involved
in photosynthesis, which is the process
by which plants turn CO2 and water
into sugar and oxygen by harnessing the
energy from the sun. Chlorophyll gives most plants
their distinctive green color. The second group of compounds
are the carotenoids, which sounds a little bit
like carrot, which makes sense because carotenoids give leaves
there yellow and orange hues. Carotenoids are present with
chlorophyll in organelles called chloroplasts year round. And these chloroplasts
are just the organelles where photosynthesis occurs. Finally, there's a
group of compounds known as anthocyanins. And anthocyanins give
plants reddish hues. And they're often
found in things like cranberries,
and blueberries, and lots of dark red leaves. These anthocyanins
are actually produced in the fall when chlorophyll
starts to break down, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Now, for most of the
year, chlorophyll is so bright green
that it blocks out some of the yellow
and orange hues coming from the carotenoids. For most of the growing
season, chlorophyll is constantly being broken
down and reproduced. But as it starts
to get colder out, the cool night air closes
off the veins of the leaves. And it gets harder for
water and nutrients to move into the chloroplasts
and rebuild chlorophyll. So what this means is
that the chlorophyll is being broken down, but
it's not being reproduced. So the green color of the
leaves starts to disappear. This means that the yellows and
the oranges of the carotenoids can start to show through. But that's not all. Anthocyanins, by contrast,
are not present year round in the leaves. Instead, they are actively
produced in the fall right before the leaves
drop off the trees. So why would a
plant suddenly want to start producing a red
pigment in a leaf that's about to drop off anyways? Scientists haven't reached
a definitive conclusion yet. But they do have some
pretty good ideas. One is that the red pigments act
as a sort of direct sunscreen as the canopy starts
to drop leaves. The leaves that remain
are exposed to more light. And those leaves are losing
the sunlight-absorbing powers of their chlorophyll. Another cool idea is that the
red pigment might actually trick migrating insects into
thinking that the tree is unhealthy and discouraging
them from laying their eggs on those trees. So all of this leads us to
some pretty cool science that you can do at home to
visualize the pigments found in leaves where you live. So all you need
for this experiment is isopropyl alcohol, some
strips of filter paper-- I used coffee filters-- a couple glasses,
scissors, and some leaves. And if you want
to be super cool, pick a few different
kinds of leaves, so that you can compare the
compounds you find within them. Step one, chop each of your
kinds of leaves up into lots of little tiny pieces. We really want to release
all of these compounds out of the leaves. So the smaller and the
finer you chop them, the better this
is going to work. Next, cover the leaves
in isopropyl alcohol. Now, this is just
rubbing alcohol, so it's not very dangerous. But you do want to make sure
you don't get this in your eyes or drink it. The next step is to grind up
these leaves in the alcohol. Now, ideally, you would be doing
this with a mortar and pestle. but I don't have that. And so I am using
a wooden spoon. Now, at this point,
you should start to see the alcohol change colors
as those pigments are released from the leaves. If you want to speed
this reaction up a bit, you can set all of your
glasses into a hot water bath and leave them for
about 30 minutes. After this, you can really
see the color change in the alcohol. Now, I strained the
leaves out of my alcohol, so that it was a
little easier to see. But you could probably
leave them in there as well. Next, cut your filter
paper into strips and place a strip into each
glass so that one side of it is touching the alcohol and the
other side is out in the air. Now, I repeated this
experiment later with longer strips
of filter paper and hung one side
out of the edge. And this actually worked
a little bit better. Now, you want to let your
glasses sit for about an hour. So what we're doing here
is called chromatography, which just means that we
are separating a mixture. Here, we are using
paper chromatography to separate the different
compounds within the leaves. So the alcohol,
our mobile phase, is being drawn up the paper
strip, our stationary phase, and it's pulling leaf
pigments along with it. Depending on their
chemical structure, molecules will have
different polarities and will want to interact
with that paper differently. Some will want to stick
tightly onto the paper, while others will move more
easily with the liquid. This means that some compounds
will travel along the paper faster than others, separating
the compounds along the strip, and giving you distinct
bands of compounds. Cool. So we actually got some
really good separation between the yellow
carotenoids on top and the green chlorophyll
on the bottom. And the longer you leave these,
the better that separation will get. Now, this is an experiment
you can easily do at home, and you should. I want to see what the
compounds from leaves from all around the world look like. So make a video response of
you doing this experiment, and leave it below. And I'll check them all out. And yeah, go on. Go forth. Do science.

**Transcript**:
Caffeine a legal stimulant that most of us are pretty familiar with, many of us use every day, and some of us are addicted to. If you are a caffeine user, you probably know your limits. For me one small cup of coffee in the morning can help keep me alert and focused, whereas  two small cups of coffee in the morning can turn me into a cat on catnip. Well for the purposes of this video and to best demonstrate the physical and mental effects of caffeine, I'm going to get very very caffeinated very very fast. For science. Go big or go home. Caffeine is a stimulant drug that acts on your central nervous system. Because caffeine is both lipid and water soluble it  can easily pass through the blood-brain barrier and act on the interior of your brain Once there, caffeine works by diminishing the effect of a neurotransmitter called adenosine. Adenosine acts as a suppressor for your nervous system, reducing neural activity and slowing everything down. Caffeine and adenosine have similar shapes so caffeine can bind to the same neuroreceptors that adenosine does. But because caffeine is not adenosine, it doesn't turn these neuroreceptors on. This is called competitive inhibition. Caffeine competes with adenosine to bind with the same receptors, And because caffeine is bound, adenosine cannot bind and its effects are inhibited. Long story short, caffeine prevents adenosine from slowing down your nervous system. So this explain part of why you feel more awake, alert and active with caffeine flowing through your veins. But adenosine inhibition isn't the only thing that caffeine does. Oh no. Caffeine also stimulates the production of adrenaline or epinephrine. Adrenaline is a pretty well known hormone involved in the fight-or-flight response. It causes all sort of physiological reactions! It increases your heart rate, increases the blood flow to your muscles, opens up your airways, causes your blood
pressure to rise, and also causes you're  your liver to release extra sugar into your blood stream for an added boost of energy. It also causes your muscle to tighten up, which would be useful if you were the lone human on the savannah, deciding or not to fight or flee from that lion over the distance, But as a modern twenty something sitting in from of my camera, it just give me the jitters. Finally caffeine also plays with the dopamine levels in your brain. Awesome, yeah. Caffeine increases the amount of dopamine present in your brain by slowing down its reabsorption, Much in the same way that cocaine increases the amount of dopamine present by slowing down how quickly it can be sucked back into your brain tissue. This means that caffeine also makes you feel good and this interaction with dopamine is how you can actually build a caffeine addiction. So now you're a happy, jittery, fight or flight ready bundle caffeine! Now what? Well the now what really depends on how your specific body metabolizes caffeine. The average half-life of caffeine in the human body is about six hours. so this means that if you have two hundred milligrams of caffeine in your average cup of coffee at 9am in the morning, then 6 hours later half of that will be left, so at 3pm you will have a hundred milligrams of caffeine left, and then another 6 hours later you will have half of the hundred you will have half of the hundred so you will have 50 milligrams of caffeine left at 9 o'clock at night. But dude, who stops at just one cup of coffee? Not this chick. So how much caffeine is too much caffeine? A lethal dose of caffeine is about two hundred milligrams per kilogram so it would take about nine thousand five hundred milligrams of caffeine to kill me. Now, there are about two hundred milligrams of caffeine in a standard cup of coffee, so that's about forty eight cups of coffee, which is a surprisingly low number, but I would have to drink all 48 of those before my body started to metabolize the caffeine, which means I would literally have to chug 48 cups of coffee. I literally wouldn't be able to drink that much coffee, both because my stomach couldn't hold that volume of liquid and also because as every coffee drinker knows, caffeine is a diuretic. before I got to cup forty anyways, the stimulant effect of caffeine would be  jacked up so high that that the alertness and awakeness would be transformed into mania,  disorientation and hallucinations... great! What would eventually kill you would be ventricular fibrillation, which basically means  that your heart would caffeine jitter itself to death. So moral of the story, caffeine is a drug. It is a stimulant that has some pretty noticeable effects on your body, can cause addiction, and, in high enough doses, can kill you. So caffeinate wisely! Go forth, do science! My hand is actually not shaking too bad right now. Don't try this at home, I know a lot of people do drink that much caffeine all on one day and  sometimes I approach it,  but I certainly don't do it over the span of 20 minutes. I actually don't feel as terrible as I thought I would have after that amount, but I certainly don't feel good either.

A lethal dose of caffeine is about two hundred milligrams per kilogram so it would take about nine thousand five hundred milligrams of caffeine to kill me. Now, there are about two hundred milligrams of caffeine in a standard cup of coffee, so that's about forty eight cups of coffee, which is a surprisingly low number, but I would have to drink all 48 of those before my body started to metabolize the caffeine, which means I would literally have to chug 48 cups of coffee. I literally wouldn't be able to drink that much coffee, both because my stomach couldn't hold that volume of liquid and also because as every coffee drinker knows, caffeine is a diuretic. before I got to cup forty anyways, the stimulant effect of caffeine would be  jacked up so high that that the alertness and awakeness would be transformed into mania,  disorientation and hallucinations... great! What would eventually kill you would be ventricular fibrillation, which basically means  that your heart would caffeine jitter itself to death. So moral of the story, caffeine is a drug. It is a stimulant that has some pretty noticeable effects on your body, can cause addiction, and, in high enough doses, can kill you. So caffeinate wisely! Go forth, do science! My hand is actually not shaking too bad right now. Don't try this at home, I know a lot of people do drink that much caffeine all on one day and  sometimes I approach it,  but I certainly don't do it over the span of 20 minutes. I actually don't feel as terrible as I thought I would have after that amount, but I certainly don't feel good either.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar She's only a few feet away. The closer he gets, the more nervous he becomes, the budding zit on his nose growing bigger and bigger until it practically eclipses his face. She looks at him hovering nearby, sees the massive zit, and giggles. He slumps away, feeling sick. Stress can sure make a mess, and it happens to both teens and adults. But how does it happen? Let's rewind to before the zit, to before Justin even sees his crush. Already late for school, Justin got to class just in time to hear the teacher say "pop quiz." He hadn't done his homework the night before, and felt more unprepared than the ambushed World War II soldiers he was supposed to write about. A sudden rush of panic swept over his body, leaving him with sweaty palms, a foggy mind and a racing heart. He stumbled out of class in a daze, and ran straight into his all-time crush, spiking up his stress. Stress is a general biological response to a potential danger. In primitive caveman terms, stress can make you fight for your life, or run for your life, if, for example, you're confronted by a hungry saber-tooth tiger. Special chemicals called stress hormones run through your body, giving you more oxygen and power to run away from danger or to face it and fight for your life, hence the term "fight or flight." But when you don't fight, or take flight, you face the plight. When we're taking final exams, sitting in traffic or pondering pollution, we internalize stress. It all begins in the brain. The hypothalamus, the master controller of your hormones, releases something called corticotropin-releasing hormone. This triggers the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland found at the base of the brain, to release adrenocorticotropic hormone which then stimulates the adrenal gland sitting on top of the kidneys to release cortisol, the major stress hormone. These natural chemicals are a great help when you need to run away quickly, or do superhuman feats of courage, but when you're simply sitting, these stress hormones collect in the body and affect your overall health. Stress hormones increase inflammation in the body, suppress the immune system, which makes you more susceptible to infection by acne-causing bacteria, and can even increase oil production in the skin. And this is the perfect storm for forming a pimple. Cortisol is a major stress hormone involved in making skin cells churn out oily lipids from special glands called sebaceous glands. But when there's too much of these oily lipids, called sebum, they can plug up the swollen, inflamed pores and trap the pesky, acne-causing bacteria inside, where they set up house and thrive. Add a dash of inflammatory neuropeptides released by the nervous system when you're -- well, nervous -- and angry zits follow. To make matters worse, Justin is a boy, meaning he's got more testosterone than girls. Testosterone is another hormone that increases oil production in the skin. So, his already oily skin, together with a boost in oil and inflammation from stress, is the perfect environment for bacteria to swell, swell, swell up into a major zit. So what could've Justin done to avoid the big pimple? Stressful situations are unavoidable. But we can try to change our responses so that we're not so stressed in the end. And had he been confident in approaching her, she might not have noticed the pimple, or he might not have had one.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar She's only a few feet away. The closer he gets, the more nervous he becomes, the budding zit on his nose growing bigger and bigger until it practically eclipses his face. She looks at him hovering nearby, sees the massive zit, and giggles. He slumps away, feeling sick. Stress can sure make a mess, and it happens to both teens and adults. But how does it happen? Let's rewind to before the zit, to before Justin even sees his crush. Already late for school, Justin got to class just in time to hear the teacher say "pop quiz." He hadn't done his homework the night before, and felt more unprepared than the ambushed World War II soldiers he was supposed to write about. A sudden rush of panic swept over his body, leaving him with sweaty palms, a foggy mind and a racing heart. He stumbled out of class in a daze, and ran straight into his all-time crush, spiking up his stress. Stress is a general biological response to a potential danger. In primitive caveman terms, stress can make you fight for your life, or run for your life, if, for example, you're confronted by a hungry saber-tooth tiger. Special chemicals called stress hormones run through your body, giving you more oxygen and power to run away from danger or to face it and fight for your life, hence the term "fight or flight." But when you don't fight, or take flight, you face the plight. When we're taking final exams, sitting in traffic or pondering pollution, we internalize stress. It all begins in the brain. The hypothalamus, the master controller of your hormones, releases something called corticotropin-releasing hormone. This triggers the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland found at the base of the brain, to release adrenocorticotropic hormone which then stimulates the adrenal gland sitting on top of the kidneys to release cortisol, the major stress hormone. These natural chemicals are a great help when you need to run away quickly, or do superhuman feats of courage, but when you're simply sitting, these stress hormones collect in the body and affect your overall health. Stress hormones increase inflammation in the body, suppress the immune system, which makes you more susceptible to infection by acne-causing bacteria, and can even increase oil production in the skin. And this is the perfect storm for forming a pimple. Cortisol is a major stress hormone involved in making skin cells churn out oily lipids from special glands called sebaceous glands. But when there's too much of these oily lipids, called sebum, they can plug up the swollen, inflamed pores and trap the pesky, acne-causing bacteria inside, where they set up house and thrive. Add a dash of inflammatory neuropeptides released by the nervous system when you're -- well, nervous -- and angry zits follow. To make matters worse, Justin is a boy, meaning he's got more testosterone than girls. Testosterone is another hormone that increases oil production in the skin. So, his already oily skin, together with a boost in oil and inflammation from stress, is the perfect environment for bacteria to swell, swell, swell up into a major zit. So what could've Justin done to avoid the big pimple? Stressful situations are unavoidable. But we can try to change our responses so that we're not so stressed in the end. And had he been confident in approaching her, she might not have noticed the pimple, or he might not have had one.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Literary critic Northrop Frye once observed that in our primitive days, our literary heroes were -- well, nearly gods, and as civilization advanced, they came down the mountain of the gods, so to speak, and became more human, more flawed, less heroic. From the divine heroes like Hercules, down the mountain below the miraculous but mortal heroes such as Beowulf, the great leaders such as King Arthur, and the great but flawed heroes like Macbeth or Othello. Below even the unlikely but eventual heroes such as Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, or Hiccup, until we reach the bottom and meet the anti-hero. Contrary to the sound, the anti-hero is not the villain, not the antagonist. The anti-hero is actually the main character in some contemporary works of literature. Guy Montag in "Fahrenheit 451," Winston Smith in "1984," who unwittingly ends up challenging those in power -- that is, those who abuse their power to brainwash the populace to believe that the ills of society have been eliminated. Ideally, those who challenge the establishment should be wise, confident, brave, physically strong, with a type of charisma that inpires followers. The anti-hero, however, at best demonstrates a few underdeveloped traits, at worst, is totally inept. The story of the anti-hero usually unfolds something like this. The anti-hero initially conforms, ignorantly accepting the established views, a typical, unquestioning, brainwashed member of society. The anti-hero struggles to conform, all the while starting to object, perhaps finding other outsiders with whom to voice his questions, and naïvely, unwisely, sharing those questions with an authority figure. The anti-hero openly challenges society, and tries to fight against the lies and tactics used to oppress the populace. This step, for the anti-hero, is seldom a matter of brave, wise and heroic opposition. Maybe the anti-hero fights and succeeds in destroying the oppressive government, with a lot of impossible luck. Perhaps he or she runs away, escapes to fight another day. All too often though, the anti-hero is killed, or brainwashed to return to conformity with the masses. No heroic triumph here, no brave individual standing up against impersonal institutions of a modern world, inspiring others to fight, or resourcefully outwitting and outgunning the massive army of the evil empire. Our storytelling ancestors calmed our fears of powerlessness by giving us Hercules and other heroes strong enough to fight off the demons and monsters that we suspected haunted the night beyond our campfires. But eventually, we realized the monsters did not lie out there, they reside inside of us. Beowulf's greatest enemy was mortality. Othello's, jealousy. Hiccup, self-doubt. And in the tales of the ineffectual anti-hero, in the stories of Guy Montag and Winston Smith, lie the warnings of contemporary storytellers playing on very primitive fears: that we are not strong enough to defeat the monsters. Only this time, not the monsters chased away by the campfire, but the very monsters who built the campfire in the first place.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Literary critic Northrop Frye once observed that in our primitive days, our literary heroes were -- well, nearly gods, and as civilization advanced, they came down the mountain of the gods, so to speak, and became more human, more flawed, less heroic. From the divine heroes like Hercules, down the mountain below the miraculous but mortal heroes such as Beowulf, the great leaders such as King Arthur, and the great but flawed heroes like Macbeth or Othello. Below even the unlikely but eventual heroes such as Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, or Hiccup, until we reach the bottom and meet the anti-hero. Contrary to the sound, the anti-hero is not the villain, not the antagonist. The anti-hero is actually the main character in some contemporary works of literature. Guy Montag in "Fahrenheit 451," Winston Smith in "1984," who unwittingly ends up challenging those in power -- that is, those who abuse their power to brainwash the populace to believe that the ills of society have been eliminated. Ideally, those who challenge the establishment should be wise, confident, brave, physically strong, with a type of charisma that inpires followers. The anti-hero, however, at best demonstrates a few underdeveloped traits, at worst, is totally inept. The story of the anti-hero usually unfolds something like this. The anti-hero initially conforms, ignorantly accepting the established views, a typical, unquestioning, brainwashed member of society. The anti-hero struggles to conform, all the while starting to object, perhaps finding other outsiders with whom to voice his questions, and naïvely, unwisely, sharing those questions with an authority figure. The anti-hero openly challenges society, and tries to fight against the lies and tactics used to oppress the populace. This step, for the anti-hero, is seldom a matter of brave, wise and heroic opposition. Maybe the anti-hero fights and succeeds in destroying the oppressive government, with a lot of impossible luck. Perhaps he or she runs away, escapes to fight another day. All too often though, the anti-hero is killed, or brainwashed to return to conformity with the masses. No heroic triumph here, no brave individual standing up against impersonal institutions of a modern world, inspiring others to fight, or resourcefully outwitting and outgunning the massive army of the evil empire. Our storytelling ancestors calmed our fears of powerlessness by giving us Hercules and other heroes strong enough to fight off the demons and monsters that we suspected haunted the night beyond our campfires. But eventually, we realized the monsters did not lie out there, they reside inside of us. Beowulf's greatest enemy was mortality. Othello's, jealousy. Hiccup, self-doubt. And in the tales of the ineffectual anti-hero, in the stories of Guy Montag and Winston Smith, lie the warnings of contemporary storytellers playing on very primitive fears: that we are not strong enough to defeat the monsters. Only this time, not the monsters chased away by the campfire, but the very monsters who built the campfire in the first place.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically high school physics education in the US, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the concept of an anti-hero in literature.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on question structure and format, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match. This question has multiple options that describe different aspects of a topic, similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, the content and intent of Question 4 are still unrelated to the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would not recommend any of the generated MCQs as a match for the ground truth MCQ. A new set of generated MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of anti-heroes in literature would be needed to find a suitable match.

**Transcript**:
Dear Mr. President, Do you know much about physics? I mean, you're the President of the United
States: a country with five thousand nuclear weapons, birthplace of the world's computing
and telecommunications industry, home of the first atomic clock and creator of the global
positioning system. But chances are, if you just took regular
American high school physics, you don't know one iota about the science behind these things
(No offense). That's because high school physics students
across most of America are not required to learn about pretty much any physical phenomena
discovered or explained more recently than 1865. Yes, 1865. That's the year the civil war ended and well
over a decade before Albert Einstein was even born! You know what can happen in 150 years, Mr.
President? A lot. Velcro, for one. But let me list some useful and important
ideas of the last 150 years of physics that aren't a required part of most standard US
high school physics courses: Photons. The structure of atoms. The existence of Antimatter. GPS. Lasers. Transistors. Diodes and LEDs. Quarks. Chaos Theory. Electron Microscopy. MRI scanning. The Big Bang. Black Holes. Star formation. The fact that gravity bends light. The fact that the universe is expanding. The Higgs Boson and the weak and strong nuclear
forces and all the rest of quantum mechanics and relativity and the topic of every single
Nobel Prize in Physics since… always. Basically, most of the important stuff. I mean, Mr. President, imagine if history
classes didn't talk about the abolition of slavery, world wars I or II, the great depression,
the rise of the US as a global superpower, the cold war or the civil rights movement
or heaven forbid the first African American President. Or imagine if biology classes didn't talk
about DNA, or hormones, or cell reproduction or the modern germ theory of disease or ecology. Or if geologists didn't talk about plate tectonics. And computer scientists… well… in 1865 a computer was a person who
computed your taxes. Now, if you were lucky enough to have an ambitious
teacher or take Advanced Placement Physics, then you might have learned about some of
Einstein's discoveries of 1905! Yes! Current events! But learning about how Einstein's work helped
set the stage for a century of amazing developments in our understanding of the universe is not
a part of the standard curriculum. So why, Mr. President, am I addressing this
letter to you? Well, you appoint the Secretary of Education,

**Transcript**:
Dear Mr. President, Do you know much about physics? I mean, you're the President of the United
States: a country with five thousand nuclear weapons, birthplace of the world's computing
and telecommunications industry, home of the first atomic clock and creator of the global
positioning system. But chances are, if you just took regular
American high school physics, you don't know one iota about the science behind these things
(No offense). That's because high school physics students
across most of America are not required to learn about pretty much any physical phenomena
discovered or explained more recently than 1865. Yes, 1865. That's the year the civil war ended and well
over a decade before Albert Einstein was even born! You know what can happen in 150 years, Mr.
President? A lot. Velcro, for one. But let me list some useful and important
ideas of the last 150 years of physics that aren't a required part of most standard US
high school physics courses: Photons. The structure of atoms. The existence of Antimatter. GPS. Lasers. Transistors. Diodes and LEDs. Quarks. Chaos Theory. Electron Microscopy. MRI scanning. The Big Bang. Black Holes. Star formation. The fact that gravity bends light. The fact that the universe is expanding. The Higgs Boson and the weak and strong nuclear
forces and all the rest of quantum mechanics and relativity and the topic of every single
Nobel Prize in Physics since… always. Basically, most of the important stuff. I mean, Mr. President, imagine if history
classes didn't talk about the abolition of slavery, world wars I or II, the great depression,
the rise of the US as a global superpower, the cold war or the civil rights movement
or heaven forbid the first African American President. Or imagine if biology classes didn't talk
about DNA, or hormones, or cell reproduction or the modern germ theory of disease or ecology. Or if geologists didn't talk about plate tectonics. And computer scientists… well… in 1865 a computer was a person who
computed your taxes. Now, if you were lucky enough to have an ambitious
teacher or take Advanced Placement Physics, then you might have learned about some of
Einstein's discoveries of 1905! Yes! Current events! But learning about how Einstein's work helped
set the stage for a century of amazing developments in our understanding of the universe is not
a part of the standard curriculum. So why, Mr. President, am I addressing this
letter to you? Well, you appoint the Secretary of Education,
for one - and I do believe that high school physics is somewhat related to education. Now, maybe your education secretary says,
"ancient physics is already hard to teach to high schoolers. And you want us to teach them modern physics
which is even harder?! Students can't really appreciate the beauty

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is one reason the video gives as a reason why those who are in charge of shaping high school Physics curricula do not include any topics that were discovered/developed after 1865?
Options: A. Many high school physics teachers do not themselves understand post-1865 topics well enough to teach them., B. There are already too many physics concepts teachers are supposed to teach--there is not enough time in the school year to teach any more., C. High school students have not taken enough math/do not have a strong enough math background to appreciate/understand post-1865 topics in physics., D. Post-1865 topics in physics are not as important to understanding physics as the fundamentals physics, as developed by Isaac Newton and others from ~1687 through 1865.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The universe contains about 100 billion galaxies. Each of those galaxies contains about 100 billion stars. Many of those stars have planets orbiting them. So how do we look for life in all that immensity? It's like searching for a needle in trillions of haystacks. We might want to focus our search on planets that we know can support life as we know it -- what we call habitable worlds. What do such planets look like? To answer that question, we don't look out there. Instead, we look at ourselves. At Earth. Because this is the one planet in the universe that we know for certain is habitable. When we look at Earth from space, we see a blue, watery world. It's no coincidence that three quarters of the surface is covered by oceans. Because of its unique chemical and physical properties, water is absolutely essential for all life as we know it. And so we get especially excited about other worlds on which water is abundant. Fortunately, water is very common in the universe. But life needs water in the form of liquid, not ice, and not vapor, and that's a little bit less common. For a planet to have liquid water at its surface, three things are important. First, the planet needs to be large enough that the force of gravity keeps the water molecules from flying off into space. For example, Mars is smaller than Earth, and so has less gravity, and that's one important reason that Mars has a very thin atmosphere, and no oceans at its surface. Second, the planet needs to have an atmosphere. Why? Because without an atmosphere, the planet is in a vacuum, and liquid water isn't stable in a vacuum. For example, our moon has no atmosphere, and so if you spill some water on the moon, it will either boil away as vapor, or freeze solid to make ice. Without the pressure of an atmosphere, liquid water can't survive. Third, the planet needs to be at the right distance from its star. Too close, and the surface temperature will exceed the boiling point of water, and oceans will turn to vapor. Too far, and the surface temperature will fall below the freezing point of water, causing the oceans to turn to ice. Fire or ice. For life as we know it, neither will suffice. You can imagine that the perfect zone where water stays liquid looks kind of like a belt around a star. We call that belt the habitable zone. So when we search for habitable worlds, we definitely want to look for planets in the habitable zones around their stars. Those regions are the best bets to find planets like Earth. But while habitable zones are a pretty good place to begin the search for planets with life, there are a couple of complications. First, a planet isn't necessarily habitable just because it's in the habitable zone. Consider the planet Venus in our solar system. If you were an alien astronomer, you'd think Venus is a pretty good bet for life. It's the right size, it has an atmosphere, and it's in the habitable zone of our sun. An alien astronomer might see it as Earth's twin. But Venus is not habitable, at least not at its surface. Not by life as we know it. It's too hot. That's because Venus' atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide, an important greenhouse gas. In fact, its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide, and is almost 100 times thicker than our own. As a result, the temperature on Venus is hot enough to melt lead, and the planet is dry as a bone. So finding planets of the right size and distance from their stars is only a beginning. We also want to know about the makeup of their atmospheres. The second complication emerges when we look a little more deeply at planet Earth. In the last 30 years, we've discovered microbes living in all sorts of extreme environments. We find them in fissures of rock miles beneath our feet, in boiling waters of the ocean floor, in acidic waters of thermal springs, and in cloud droplets miles above our heads. These so-called extremophiles aren't rare. Some scientists estimate that the mass of microbes living deep underground equals the mass of all the life at Earth's surface. These subterranean microbes don't need oceans or sunshine. These discoveries suggest that Earth-like planets may be only the tip of the astrobiological iceberg. It's possible that life might persist in aquifers beneath the surface of Mars. Microbes may thrive on Jupiter's moon Europa, where liquid water ocean probably lies beneath the icy crust. Another ocean beneath the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus is the source of geysers erupting into space. Could these geysers be raining microbes? Could we fly through them to find out? And what about life as we don't know it, using a liquid other than water? Maybe we are the crazy creatures living in an unusual and extreme environment. Maybe the real habitable zone is so large that there are billions of needles in those trillions of haystacks. Maybe in the big scheme of things, Earth is only one of many different kinds of habitable worlds. The only way to find out is to go out and explore.

For example, Mars is smaller than Earth, and so has less gravity, and that's one important reason that Mars has a very thin atmosphere, and no oceans at its surface. Second, the planet needs to have an atmosphere. Why? Because without an atmosphere, the planet is in a vacuum, and liquid water isn't stable in a vacuum. For example, our moon has no atmosphere, and so if you spill some water on the moon, it will either boil away as vapor, or freeze solid to make ice. Without the pressure of an atmosphere, liquid water can't survive. Third, the planet needs to be at the right distance from its star. Too close, and the surface temperature will exceed the boiling point of water, and oceans will turn to vapor. Too far, and the surface temperature will fall below the freezing point of water, causing the oceans to turn to ice. Fire or ice. For life as we know it, neither will suffice. You can imagine that the perfect zone where water stays liquid looks kind of like a belt around a star. We call that belt the habitable zone. So when we search for habitable worlds, we definitely want to look for planets in the habitable zones around their stars. Those regions are the best bets to find planets like Earth. But while habitable zones are a pretty good place to begin the search for planets with life, there are a couple of complications. First, a planet isn't necessarily habitable just because it's in the habitable zone. Consider the planet Venus in our solar system. If you were an alien astronomer, you'd think Venus is a pretty good bet for life. It's the right size, it has an atmosphere, and it's in the habitable zone of our sun. An alien astronomer might see it as Earth's twin. But Venus is not habitable, at least not at its surface. Not by life as we know it. It's too hot. That's because Venus' atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide, an important greenhouse gas. In fact, its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide, and is almost 100 times thicker than our own. As a result, the temperature on Venus is hot enough to melt lead, and the planet is dry as a bone. So finding planets of the right size and distance from their stars is only a beginning. We also want to know about the makeup of their atmospheres. The second complication emerges when we look a little more deeply at planet Earth. In the last 30 years, we've discovered microbes living in all sorts of extreme environments. We find them in fissures of rock miles beneath our feet, in boiling waters of the ocean floor, in acidic waters of thermal springs, and in cloud droplets miles above our heads. These so-called extremophiles aren't rare. Some scientists estimate that the mass of microbes living deep underground equals the mass of all the life at Earth's surface. These subterranean microbes don't need oceans or sunshine. These discoveries suggest that Earth-like planets may be only the tip of the astrobiological iceberg. It's possible that life might persist in aquifers beneath the surface of Mars. Microbes may thrive on Jupiter's moon Europa, where liquid water ocean probably lies beneath the icy crust. Another ocean beneath the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus is the source of geysers erupting into space. Could these geysers be raining microbes? Could we fly through them to find out? And what about life as we don't know it, using a liquid other than water? Maybe we are the crazy creatures living in an unusual and extreme environment. Maybe the real habitable zone is so large that there are billions of needles in those trillions of haystacks. Maybe in the big scheme of things, Earth is only one of many different kinds of habitable worlds. The only way to find out is to go out and explore.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The universe contains about 100 billion galaxies. Each of those galaxies contains about 100 billion stars. Many of those stars have planets orbiting them. So how do we look for life in all that immensity? It's like searching for a needle in trillions of haystacks. We might want to focus our search on planets that we know can support life as we know it -- what we call habitable worlds. What do such planets look like? To answer that question, we don't look out there. Instead, we look at ourselves. At Earth. Because this is the one planet in the universe that we know for certain is habitable. When we look at Earth from space, we see a blue, watery world. It's no coincidence that three quarters of the surface is covered by oceans. Because of its unique chemical and physical properties, water is absolutely essential for all life as we know it. And so we get especially excited about other worlds on which water is abundant. Fortunately, water is very common in the universe. But life needs water in the form of liquid, not ice, and not vapor, and that's a little bit less common. For a planet to have liquid water at its surface, three things are important. First, the planet needs to be large enough that the force of gravity keeps the water molecules from flying off into space. For example, Mars is smaller than Earth, and so has less gravity, and that's one important reason that Mars has a very thin atmosphere, and no oceans at its surface.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar (Stories from the Sea: How Life Came to Land) Life for my kind wasn't always this way. There was a time when no animals lived on land. All life was in the ocean. The ocean's where all of us animals got our start, more than half a billion years ago, This is where all animal body types -- or phyla, as scientists call them -- first evolved. You know, there are more than 30 animal phyla, but only a handful of major ones had what it took to do something completely daring: step out of the ocean, and on to dry land. So, which of these land-dwelling phyla first invaded the land? Was it me and my mollusc friends, with our amazing mantles and single foot? Perhaps the chordate crowd, with their notochords, segmented muscles and big bony skeletons. Or maybe those lowly annelid worms, with their powerful ringed bodies. Or did the Arthropods first make landfall, with their little flexible suits of armor -- their exoskeleton? Ah, yes. The arthropods. From crustaceans to millipedes, spiders to insects, the arthropods outnumber all animals on land. So what's their secret? Their exoskeleton is key, but here's the real kicker: jointed appendages. They're like little living Swiss army knives: antennae, multiple mouth parts, an obscene number of legs, if you ask me. There's one group of arthropods -- the insects -- that really rule the land. Three body parts, six legs, and an annoying tendency to take over. Sure, they have to molt to grow, but that doesn't seem to pose a problem. The insects even invented the first wings, and conquered the skies. Ah, well. So what if arthropods were the first to reach land and invent flight, a hundred million years before the rest of us? So what if they pollinate crops around the world, and make up 75% of all land animal species? And that for every single human, there's 200 million of them? Sure, those leggy arthropods may still be in the lead when it comes to conquering land, but we still rule in the sea. There are more species of molluscs in the ocean than any other animal phylum. We're just getting started up here on land. Besides, the seas are rising. Just give us some time. Who knows who'll end up ruling this ocean planet?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Where did animal life first arise?
Options: A. In the ocean, B. On land, C. In outer space, D. Nobody knows, E. None of the above
Correct Option: A

The ocean's where all of us animals got our start, more than half a billion years ago, This is where all animal body types -- or phyla, as scientists call them -- first evolved. You know, there are more than 30 animal phyla, but only a handful of major ones had what it took to do something completely daring: step out of the ocean, and on to dry land. So, which of these land-dwelling phyla first invaded the land? Was it me and my mollusc friends, with our amazing mantles and single foot? Perhaps the chordate crowd, with their notochords, segmented muscles and big bony skeletons. Or maybe those lowly annelid worms, with their powerful ringed bodies. Or did the Arthropods first make landfall, with their little flexible suits of armor -- their exoskeleton? Ah, yes. The arthropods. From crustaceans to millipedes, spiders to insects, the arthropods outnumber all animals on land. So what's their secret? Their exoskeleton is key, but here's the real kicker: jointed appendages. They're like little living Swiss army knives: antennae, multiple mouth parts, an obscene number of legs, if you ask me. There's one group of arthropods -- the insects -- that really rule the land. Three body parts, six legs, and an annoying tendency to take over. Sure, they have to molt to grow, but that doesn't seem to pose a problem. The insects even invented the first wings, and conquered the skies. Ah, well. So what if arthropods were the first to reach land and invent flight, a hundred million years before the rest of us? So what if they pollinate crops around the world, and make up 75% of all land animal species? And that for every single human, there's 200 million of them? Sure, those leggy arthropods may still be in the lead when it comes to conquering land, but we still rule in the sea. There are more species of molluscs in the ocean than any other animal phylum. We're just getting started up here on land. Besides, the seas are rising. Just give us some time. Who knows who'll end up ruling this ocean planet?

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Lawn signs sprouting everywhere. Round-the-clock ads on radio and television. The phone rings. It's a robo-call from the president, or his opponent, asking for your money, and your vote. And while you're at it, watch their YouTube videos and like them on Facebook. Election time. We all know the look and feel of modern campaigns. But what was it like in the early days of the Republic, when, say, George Washington ran for office? Well, in fact, he didn't run. When Washington became the first president in 1789, there were no political parties, no conventions or primaries, no campaign, no election season. Not really any candidates. Even the year was odd. Literally. 1789 was the only presidential election ever held in an odd year. After the framers invented the constitution and the presidency 225 years ago, the country set about the business of choosing its first executive. Agreeing with Ben Franklin, many people thought "The first man at the helm will be a good one," and by that, Franklin meant George Washington. Greatest hero of the Revolution, Washington presided over the convention that created the constitution, rarely speaking. He never discussed the job of president, or of wanting it. And when the first presidential election took place, it was a crazy-quilt affair, with many hands stitching the pattern. Under the new constitution, each state was given a number of electors. who would cast a vote for two names. The man with the most votes would be president, the second-place finisher was vice president. Ah, but who picked the electors? That was left up to the states. Six of them let the people decide, or at least white men over 21 who owned property. In New Jersey, some women voted, a right later taken away. But in other states, the legislature picked the electors. At that time, many people thought democracy was one step away from mob rule and a decision this important should be left to wiser men. These electors then voted for president. All the states had to do was get their votes in on time. But there were glitches. Only 10 of the 13 states voted. Rhode Island and North Carolina hadn't ratified the constitution and couldn't vote. New York missed the deadline for naming its electors, and also was not counted. When the votes were tallied, it was unanimous. George Washington won easily. John Adams trailed far behind, finishing second, and became the vice president. Told of his victory, George Washington was not surprised. At Mount Vernon, his bags were already packed. He moved to New York City, the nation's temporary capital, and he would have to figure out just what a president was supposed to do. Since that first election, American democracy and elections have come a long way. The constitution has been changed to open up voting to more people: black men, women, Native Americans, and eighteen-year-olds included. Getting that basic right extended to all those people has been a long, hard struggle. So when you think you can't stand any more of those lawn signs, and TV ads, just remember: the right to vote wasn't always for everyone, and that's a piece of history worth knowing.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Lawn signs sprouting everywhere. Round-the-clock ads on radio and television. The phone rings. It's a robo-call from the president, or his opponent, asking for your money, and your vote. And while you're at it, watch their YouTube videos and like them on Facebook. Election time. We all know the look and feel of modern campaigns. But what was it like in the early days of the Republic, when, say, George Washington ran for office? Well, in fact, he didn't run. When Washington became the first president in 1789, there were no political parties, no conventions or primaries, no campaign, no election season. Not really any candidates. Even the year was odd. Literally. 1789 was the only presidential election ever held in an odd year. After the framers invented the constitution and the presidency 225 years ago, the country set about the business of choosing its first executive. Agreeing with Ben Franklin, many people thought "The first man at the helm will be a good one," and by that, Franklin meant George Washington. Greatest hero of the Revolution, Washington presided over the convention that created the constitution, rarely speaking. He never discussed the job of president, or of wanting it. And when the first presidential election took place, it was a crazy-quilt affair, with many hands stitching the pattern. Under the new constitution, each state was given a number of electors. who would cast a vote for two names. The man with the most votes would be president, the second-place finisher was vice president. Ah, but who picked the electors? That was left up to the states. Six of them let the people decide, or at least white men over 21 who owned property. In New Jersey, some women voted, a right later taken away. But in other states, the legislature picked the electors. At that time, many people thought democracy was one step away from mob rule and a decision this important should be left to wiser men. These electors then voted for president. All the states had to do was get their votes in on time. But there were glitches. Only 10 of the 13 states voted. Rhode Island and North Carolina hadn't ratified the constitution and couldn't vote. New York missed the deadline for naming its electors, and also was not counted. When the votes were tallied, it was unanimous. George Washington won easily. John Adams trailed far behind, finishing second, and became the vice president. Told of his victory, George Washington was not surprised. At Mount Vernon, his bags were already packed. He moved to New York City, the nation's temporary capital, and he would have to figure out just what a president was supposed to do. Since that first election, American democracy and elections have come a long way. The constitution has been changed to open up voting to more people: black men, women, Native Americans, and eighteen-year-olds included. Getting that basic right extended to all those people has been a long, hard struggle. So when you think you can't stand any more of those lawn signs, and TV ads, just remember: the right to vote wasn't always for everyone, and that's a piece of history worth knowing.

**Transcript**:
Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Most people have heard of the Electoral College during presidential election years. But what exactly is the Electoral College? Simply said, it is a group of people appointed by each state who formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States. To understand how this process began and how it continues today, we can look at the Constitution of the United States: article two, section one, clause two of the constitution. It specifies how many electors each state is entitled to have. Since 1964, there have been 538 electors in each presidential election. How do they decide on the number 538? Well, the number of electors is equal to the total voting membership of the United States Congress. 435 representatives, plus 100 senators, and 3 electors from the District of Columbia. Essentially, the Democratic candidate and Republican candidate are each trying to add up the electors in every state so that they surpass 270 electoral votes, or just over half the 538 votes, and win the presidency. So how do states even get electoral votes? Each state receives a particular number of electors based on population size. The census is conducted every 10 years, so every time the census happens, states might gain or lose a few electoral votes. Let's say you're a voter in California, a state with 55 electoral votes. If your candidate wins in California, they get all 55 of the state's electoral votes. If your candidate loses, they get none. This is why many presidential candidates want to win states like Texas, Florida, and New York. If you currently add up the electoral votes of those three states, you would have 96 electoral votes. Even if a candidate won North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire. Connecticut and West Virginia, they would only gain 31 electoral votes total from those eight states. Here is where it can get a little tricky. On a rare occasion, like in the year 2000, someone can win the popular vote but fail to gain 270 electoral votes. This means that the winner may have won and collected their electoral votes by small margins, winning just enough states with just enough electoral votes, but the losing candidate may have captured large voter margins in the remaining states. If this is the case, the very large margins secured by the losing candidate in the other states would add up to over 50% of the ballots cast nationally. Therefore, the losing candidate may have gained more than 50% of the ballots cast by voters, but failed to gain 270 of the electoral votes. Some critics of the electoral college argue the system gives an unfair advantage to states with large numbers of electoral votes. Think of it this way. It is possible for a candidate to not get a single person's vote -- not one vote -- in 39 states, or the District of Columbia, yet be elected president by winning the popular vote in just 11 of these 12 states: California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia or Virginia. This is why both parties pay attention to these states. However, others argue that the electoral college protects small states such as Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire, and even geographically large states with small populations like Alaska, Wyoming and the Dakotas. That's because a candidate can't completely ignore small states, because in a close election, every electoral vote counts. There are certain states that have a long history of voting for a particular party. These are known as "safe states." For the past four election cycles -- in 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 -- Democrats could count on states like Oregon, Maryland, Michigan and Massachusetts, whereas the Republicans could count on states like Mississippi, Alabama, Kansas and Idaho. States that are teetering between between parties are called "swing states." In the past four election cycles, Ohio and Florida have been swing states, twice providing electoral votes for a Democratic candidate, and twice providing electoral votes for a Republican candidate. Think about it. Do you live in a safe state? If so, is it a Democratic or Republican safe state? Do you live in a swing state? Are your neighboring states swing or safe? Is the population in your state increasing or decreasing? And do not forget, when you are watching the electoral returns on election night every four years and the big map of the United States is on the screen, know that the magic number is 270 and start adding.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Most people have heard of the Electoral College during presidential election years. But what exactly is the Electoral College? Simply said, it is a group of people appointed by each state who formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States. To understand how this process began and how it continues today, we can look at the Constitution of the United States: article two, section one, clause two of the constitution. It specifies how many electors each state is entitled to have. Since 1964, there have been 538 electors in each presidential election. How do they decide on the number 538? Well, the number of electors is equal to the total voting membership of the United States Congress. 435 representatives, plus 100 senators, and 3 electors from the District of Columbia. Essentially, the Democratic candidate and Republican candidate are each trying to add up the electors in every state so that they surpass 270 electoral votes, or just over half the 538 votes, and win the presidency. So how do states even get electoral votes? Each state receives a particular number of electors based on population size. The census is conducted every 10 years, so every time the census happens, states might gain or lose a few electoral votes. Let's say you're a voter in California, a state with 55 electoral votes. If your candidate wins in California, they get all 55 of the state's electoral votes. If your candidate loses, they get none. This is why many presidential candidates want to win states like Texas, Florida, and New York. If you currently add up the electoral votes of those three states, you would have 96 electoral votes. Even if a candidate won North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire. Connecticut and West Virginia, they would only gain 31 electoral votes total from those eight states. Here is where it can get a little tricky. On a rare occasion, like in the year 2000, someone can win the popular vote but fail to gain 270 electoral votes. This means that the winner may have won and collected their electoral votes by small margins, winning just enough states with just enough electoral votes, but the losing candidate may have captured large voter margins in the remaining states. If this is the case, the very large margins secured by the losing candidate in the other states would add up to over 50% of the ballots cast nationally. Therefore, the losing candidate may have gained more than 50% of the ballots cast by voters, but failed to gain 270 of the electoral votes. Some critics of the electoral college argue the system gives an unfair advantage to states with large numbers of electoral votes. Think of it this way. It is possible for a candidate to not get a single person's vote -- not one vote -- in 39 states, or the District of Columbia, yet be elected president by winning the popular vote in just 11 of these 12 states: California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia or Virginia. This is why both parties pay attention to these states. However, others argue that the electoral college protects small states such as Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire, and even geographically large states with small populations like Alaska, Wyoming and the Dakotas. That's because a candidate can't completely ignore small states, because in a close election, every electoral vote counts. There are certain states that have a long history of voting for a particular party. These are known as "safe states." For the past four election cycles -- in 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 -- Democrats could count on states like Oregon, Maryland, Michigan and Massachusetts, whereas the Republicans could count on states like Mississippi, Alabama, Kansas and Idaho.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can tell you that the generated MCQs seem to be related to the Bill of Rights, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the Electoral College and its description in the Constitution of the United States.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match, but only because it mentions the significance of a historical document (the Bill of Rights), whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the description of the Electoral College in a historical document (the Constitution of the United States). However, the content and options of Question 6 are not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would not recommend any of the generated MCQs as a match for the ground truth MCQ. A new generated MCQ that specifically asks about the Electoral College and its description in the Constitution of the United States would be a better match.

Index: No match (or 6, but with a very low confidence level)

Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Most people have heard of the Electoral College during presidential election years. But what exactly is the Electoral College? Simply said, it is a group of people appointed by each state who formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States. To understand how this process began and how it continues today, we can look at the Constitution of the United States: article two, section one, clause two of the constitution. It specifies how many electors each state is entitled to have. Since 1964, there have been 538 electors in each presidential election. How do they decide on the number 538? Well, the number of electors is equal to the total voting membership of the United States Congress. 435 representatives, plus 100 senators, and 3 electors from the District of Columbia. Essentially, the Democratic candidate and Republican candidate are each trying to add up the electors in every state so that they surpass 270 electoral votes, or just over half the 538 votes, and win the presidency. So how do states even get electoral votes? Each state receives a particular number of electors based on population size. The census is conducted every 10 years, so every time the census happens, states might gain or lose a few electoral votes. Let's say you're a voter in California, a state with 55 electoral votes. If your candidate wins in California, they get all 55 of the state's electoral votes. If your candidate loses, they get none. This is why many presidential candidates want to win states like Texas, Florida, and New York. If you currently add up the electoral votes of those three states, you would have 96 electoral votes. Even if a candidate won North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire. Connecticut and West Virginia, they would only gain 31 electoral votes total from those eight states. Here is where it can get a little tricky. On a rare occasion, like in the year 2000, someone can win the popular vote but fail to gain 270 electoral votes. This means that the winner may have won and collected their electoral votes by small margins, winning just enough states with just enough electoral votes, but the losing candidate may have captured large voter margins in the remaining states. If this is the case, the very large margins secured by the losing candidate in the other states would add up to over 50% of the ballots cast nationally. Therefore, the losing candidate may have gained more than 50% of the ballots cast by voters, but failed to gain 270 of the electoral votes. Some critics of the electoral college argue the system gives an unfair advantage to states with large numbers of electoral votes. Think of it this way. It is possible for a candidate to not get a single person's vote -- not one vote -- in 39 states, or the District of Columbia, yet be elected president by winning the popular vote in just 11 of these 12 states: California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia or Virginia. This is why both parties pay attention to these states. However, others argue that the electoral college protects small states such as Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire, and even geographically large states with small populations like Alaska, Wyoming and the Dakotas. That's because a candidate can't completely ignore small states, because in a close election, every electoral vote counts. There are certain states that have a long history of voting for a particular party. These are known as "safe states." For the past four election cycles -- in 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 -- Democrats could count on states like Oregon, Maryland, Michigan and Massachusetts, whereas the Republicans could count on states like Mississippi, Alabama, Kansas and Idaho. States that are teetering between between parties are called "swing states." In the past four election cycles, Ohio and Florida have been swing states, twice providing electoral votes for a Democratic candidate, and twice providing electoral votes for a Republican candidate. Think about it. Do you live in a safe state? If so, is it a Democratic or Republican safe state? Do you live in a swing state? Are your neighboring states swing or safe? Is the population in your state increasing or decreasing? And do not forget, when you are watching the electoral returns on election night every four years and the big map of the United States is on the screen, know that the magic number is 270 and start adding.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Take an adjective such as "implacable," or a verb like "proliferate," or even another noun, "crony," and add a suffix, such as "-ity," or "-tion," or "-ism." You've created a new noun. "Implacability," "proliferation," "cronyism." Sounds impressive, right? Wrong! You've just unleashed a flesh-eating zombie. Nouns made from other parts of speech are called nominalizations. Academics love them. So do lawyers, bureaucrats, business writers. I call them zombie nouns, because they consume the living. They cannibalize active verbs, they suck the lifeblood from adjectives, and they substitute abstract entities for human beings. Here's an example. "The proliferation of nominalizations in a discursive formation may be an indication of a tendency towards pomposity and abstraction." Huh? This sentence contains no fewer than seven nominalizations, yet it fails to tell us who is doing what. When we eliminate, or reanimate, most of the zombie nouns, so "tendency" becomes "tend," "abstraction" becomes "abstract," then we add a human subject and some active verbs, the sentence springs back to life. "Writers who overload their sentences with nominalizations tend to sound pompous and abstract." Only one zombie noun -- the key word "nominalizations" -- has been allowed to remain standing. At their best, nominalizations help us express complex ideas, perception, intelligence, epistemology. At their worst, they impede clear communication. To get a feeling for how zombie nouns work, release a few of them into a lively sentence and watch them sap all its energy. George Orwell played this game in his essay "Politics in the English Language." He started with a well-known verse from the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible. It says "I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all." Now here's Orwell's modern English version. "Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account." The Bible passage speaks to our senses and emotions with concrete nouns, descriptions of people, and punchy, abstract nouns such as "race," "battle," "riches," "time," "chance." Not a zombie among them. Orwell's satirical translation, on the other hand, is teeming with nominalizations and other vague abstractions. The zombies have taken over, and the humans have fled the village. Zombie nouns do their worst damage when they gather in jargon-generating packs and swallow every noun, verb and adjective in sight. So "globe" becomes "global," becomes "globalize," becomes "globalization." The grandfather of all nominalizations, antidisestablishmentarianism, contains at least two verbs, three adjectives, and six other nouns inside its distended belly. A paragraph heavily populated by nominalizations will send your readers straight to sleep. Rescue them from the zombie apocalypse with vigorous verb-driven sentences that are concrete and clearly structured. You want your sentences to live, not to join the living dead.

It says "I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all." Now here's Orwell's modern English version. "Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account." The Bible passage speaks to our senses and emotions with concrete nouns, descriptions of people, and punchy, abstract nouns such as "race," "battle," "riches," "time," "chance." Not a zombie among them. Orwell's satirical translation, on the other hand, is teeming with nominalizations and other vague abstractions. The zombies have taken over, and the humans have fled the village. Zombie nouns do their worst damage when they gather in jargon-generating packs and swallow every noun, verb and adjective in sight. So "globe" becomes "global," becomes "globalize," becomes "globalization." The grandfather of all nominalizations, antidisestablishmentarianism, contains at least two verbs, three adjectives, and six other nouns inside its distended belly. A paragraph heavily populated by nominalizations will send your readers straight to sleep. Rescue them from the zombie apocalypse with vigorous verb-driven sentences that are concrete and clearly structured. You want your sentences to live, not to join the living dead.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be unrelated to the topic of the transcript, which is about nominalizations and their effect on language.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of them match. But if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 8, because it is the only one that has a slightly similar format to the ground truth MCQ, with a question and options that could potentially be related to a language or linguistics topic. However, the content and intent of Question 8 are still unrelated to the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 8 (although it's still not a good match).

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically designed to match the topic and content of the transcript. Some possible examples of generated MCQs that might match the ground truth MCQ could be:

* Question: What is the effect of using nominalizations in writing?
Options: A. It makes the text more engaging, B. It makes the text more confusing, C. It makes the text more formal, D. It makes the text more concise.
* Question: Why should nominalizations be used with care in writing?
Options: A. Because they can make the text more interesting, B. Because they can make the text more complex, C. Because they can obscure the meaning of the text, D. Because they can make the text more concise.

These generated MCQs would be more likely to match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Transcriber: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Take an adjective such as "implacable," or a verb like "proliferate," or even another noun, "crony," and add a suffix, such as "-ity," or "-tion," or "-ism." You've created a new noun. "Implacability," "proliferation," "cronyism." Sounds impressive, right? Wrong! You've just unleashed a flesh-eating zombie. Nouns made from other parts of speech are called nominalizations. Academics love them. So do lawyers, bureaucrats, business writers. I call them zombie nouns, because they consume the living. They cannibalize active verbs, they suck the lifeblood from adjectives, and they substitute abstract entities for human beings. Here's an example. "The proliferation of nominalizations in a discursive formation may be an indication of a tendency towards pomposity and abstraction." Huh? This sentence contains no fewer than seven nominalizations, yet it fails to tell us who is doing what. When we eliminate, or reanimate, most of the zombie nouns, so "tendency" becomes "tend," "abstraction" becomes "abstract," then we add a human subject and some active verbs, the sentence springs back to life. "Writers who overload their sentences with nominalizations tend to sound pompous and abstract." Only one zombie noun -- the key word "nominalizations" -- has been allowed to remain standing. At their best, nominalizations help us express complex ideas, perception, intelligence, epistemology. At their worst, they impede clear communication. To get a feeling for how zombie nouns work, release a few of them into a lively sentence and watch them sap all its energy. George Orwell played this game in his essay "Politics in the English Language." He started with a well-known verse from the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible. It says "I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all." Now here's Orwell's modern English version. "Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account." The Bible passage speaks to our senses and emotions with concrete nouns, descriptions of people, and punchy, abstract nouns such as "race," "battle," "riches," "time," "chance."

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The first 10 amendments
to the U.S. Constitution -- also known as the Bill of Rights -- were ratified or passed
over 200 years ago. But even though they're a bit, well, old, these first 10 amendments are still
the most debated and discussed section of our Constitution today. So, can you remember what they are? Let's take a look. The First Amendment
is the freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly and petition. This may be the most revered
of the amendments. The First Amendment protects our rights
to say and write our opinions, worship how we please,
assemble together peacefully and petition our government,
if we feel the need. The Second Amendment
is the right to bear arms. The original intent
of the Second Amendment was to protect colonists
from the invading British soldiers, but it now guarantees
that you have the right to own a gun to defend
yourself and your property. The Third Amendment is called
the "Quartering" amendment. It was written in response
to the British occupation, and as a result of the colonists
having to house -- or quarter -- soldiers in their homes
during the American Revolution. Because of this amendment, our government can never force us
to house soldiers in our home. The Fourth Amendment
is the right to search and seizure. The police can't come into our home
without a search warrant and take our personal property. Today, many concerns have arisen
about our rights to privacy in technology. For example, can the government track
your location with your smartphone, or can social media postings
such as on Facebook and Twitter be used without a warrant? On to the Fifth:
It's all about due process. You've probably heard the phrase
"I plead the Fifth" in movies or on TV. They're talking about the Fifth Amendment, which says that you don't have to take
the witness stand against yourself if you may end up incriminating yourself. OK, we're halfway done. The Sixth and Seventh Amendments
are about how the legal system works. If you're accused of a crime, you have the right to a speedy
public trial and an impartial jury. You also have the right to a lawyer, and the right to take
the stand if you choose. This is important because it will prevent
the accused from sitting in prison forever and insists that the prosecution
proceed with undue delay. The Seventh says you have
the right to a jury trial, where 12 impartial peers decide
your innocence or guilt in the courtroom, as opposed to a judge doing it all alone. The Eight Amendment prohibits
cruel and unusual punishment. Is the death penalty cruel? Is it unusual? It's hard for Americans to agree
on the definitions of cruel and unusual. The Ninth and Tenth Amendments
are called the non-rights amendments. They say that the rights
not listed in the Bill of Rights are retained by the people in the states. We have other rights
that are not listed in the Constitution, and the states have the right
to make their own policies, like instituting state taxes. So now you know all 10 amendments. Can you remember them all? If not, remember this: the Bill of Rights is a crucial piece
of American history, and though society
has undergone many changes these past 200 and some years, the interpretation and application
of these amendments are as vital today as they were when they were written.

Transcriber: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The first 10 amendments
to the U.S. Constitution -- also known as the Bill of Rights -- were ratified or passed
over 200 years ago. But even though they're a bit, well, old, these first 10 amendments are still
the most debated and discussed section of our Constitution today. So, can you remember what they are? Let's take a look. The First Amendment
is the freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly and petition. This may be the most revered
of the amendments. The First Amendment protects our rights
to say and write our opinions, worship how we please,
assemble together peacefully and petition our government,
if we feel the need. The Second Amendment
is the right to bear arms. The original intent
of the Second Amendment was to protect colonists
from the invading British soldiers, but it now guarantees
that you have the right to own a gun to defend
yourself and your property. The Third Amendment is called
the "Quartering" amendment. It was written in response
to the British occupation, and as a result of the colonists
having to house -- or quarter -- soldiers in their homes
during the American Revolution. Because of this amendment, our government can never force us
to house soldiers in our home. The Fourth Amendment
is the right to search and seizure. The police can't come into our home
without a search warrant and take our personal property. Today, many concerns have arisen
about our rights to privacy in technology. For example, can the government track
your location with your smartphone, or can social media postings
such as on Facebook and Twitter be used without a warrant? On to the Fifth:
It's all about due process. You've probably heard the phrase
"I plead the Fifth" in movies or on TV. They're talking about the Fifth Amendment, which says that you don't have to take
the witness stand against yourself if you may end up incriminating yourself. OK, we're halfway done. The Sixth and Seventh Amendments
are about how the legal system works. If you're accused of a crime, you have the right to a speedy
public trial and an impartial jury. You also have the right to a lawyer, and the right to take
the stand if you choose. This is important because it will prevent
the accused from sitting in prison forever and insists that the prosecution
proceed with undue delay. The Seventh says you have
the right to a jury trial, where 12 impartial peers decide
your innocence or guilt in the courtroom, as opposed to a judge doing it all alone. The Eight Amendment prohibits
cruel and unusual punishment. Is the death penalty cruel? Is it unusual? It's hard for Americans to agree
on the definitions of cruel and unusual. The Ninth and Tenth Amendments
are called the non-rights amendments. They say that the rights
not listed in the Bill of Rights are retained by the people in the states. We have other rights
that are not listed in the Constitution, and the states have the right
to make their own policies, like instituting state taxes. So now you know all 10 amendments. Can you remember them all? If not, remember this: the Bill of Rights is a crucial piece
of American history, and though society
has undergone many changes these past 200 and some years, the interpretation and application
of these amendments are as vital today as they were when they were written.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is about the Bill of Rights, while the generated MCQs are about the digestive system.

However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that none of them are similar, but I can tell you that the question that is the least dissimilar in terms of the structure of the question would be:

 Question 5, but even this one doesn't have any relation with the ground truth MCQ.

But if I really had to choose one that is the most similar (which is not similar at all), I would say:

 Question 1, because this is the first question, but really there isn't a question that matches the ground truth MCQ.

But let me try to help, and I can give you an example of a generated MCQ that would be similar to the ground truth MCQ:

Example of a similar generated MCQ:
 Question: In what year were the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution ratified?
 Options: A. 1720, B. 1677, C. 1791, D. 1985
 Correct Option: C

This example is similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Again, I apologize, but I couldn't find a similar generated MCQ.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar It's March the 17th in A.D. 73. We're visiting ancient Rome
to watch the Liberalia, an annual festival that celebrates
the liberty of Rome's citizens. We're looking in at a 17-year-old
named Lucius Popidius Secundus. He's not from a poor family, but he lives
in the region known as the Subura, a poorer neighborhood in Rome,
yet close to the center of the city. (Gong) The tenants of these
apartments are crammed in, (Grunting) which poses considerable risk. Fires are frequent and the smell of ash
and smoke in the morning is not uncommon. Lucius, who awoke at dawn,
has family duties to perform today. (Cheering) His 15-year-old brother is coming of age. Half the children in ancient Rome
die before they reach adulthood, so this is a particularly
important milestone. Lucius watches his brother
stand in his new toga before the household shrine
with its protective deities, as he places his bulla,
a protective amulet, in the shrine with a prayer of thanks. The bulla had worked.
It had protected him. Unlike many others,
he had survived to become an adult. At 17, Lucius has almost
completed his education. He has learned to speak well,
make public speeches, and how to read and write
both Latin and Greek. His father has taught him
the types of things you can't learn in the classroom: how to run, how to swim, and how to fight. Lucius could choose, at 17,
to become a military tribune and command soldiers
on the edge of the Empire. But in other ways,
Lucius is still a child. He's not trusted
to arrange business deals. His father will take care
of that until he is 25. And Dad will arrange Lucius' marriage
to a girl 10 years younger. His dad has his eye on a family
with a 7-year-old daughter. Back to the Liberalia. As Lucius leaves with his family, the shops are open as the population
goes about its business. The streets are full
of itinerant traders selling trinkets and people bustling from place to place. Large wagons are not allowed
in the city until after the ninth hour but the streets are still crowded. Fathers and uncles
take the kids to the Forum Augustus to see statues of Rome's famous warriors like Aeneas, who led Rome's ancestors,
the Trojans, to Italy. And Romulus, Rome's founder. And all the great generals of the Republic
from more than 100 years earlier. Lovingly, we can imagine
fathers and guardians with their now adult children remembering stories of Rome's glory and re-telling the good deeds and sayings
of the great men of the past: lessons on how to live well, and to overcome the follies of youth. There is a sense of history in this place,
relevant to their present. Romans made an empire
without end in time and space. (Thump) Rome was destined to be
eternal through warfare. Wars were a fact of life, even in A.D. 73. There are campaigns in the north
of England and into Scotland, to the north of the River
Danube into Romania, and on the frontier
between Syria and Iraq to the east. It's now the eighth hour --
time to head for the baths. Lucius and his family head up
the Via Lata, the wide street, to the Campus Martius,
and the enormous Baths of Agrippa. The family members leave
the clients and freedmen outside, and enter the baths with their peer group. Baths would change from dark,
steamy rooms to light ones. The Romans had perfected window glass. Everyone moves from the cold room to the tepid room and to the very hot room. (Man) Oops! More than an hour later, the bathers leave massaged, oiled, (Whistling) and have been scraped down with a strigil to remove the remaining dirt. At the ninth hour, seven hours
after they left home, the men return for a celebratory dinner. Dinner is an intimate affair, with nine people
reclining around the low table. Slaves attend to their every need if the diners, through gestures,
demand more food and wine. As the day closes, we can hear
the rumble of wagons outside. The clients and freedmen, with a meal of robust
-- if inferior -- food inside them, shuffle off to the now tepid baths before returning
to their apartment blocks. Back at Lucius' house,
the drinking continues into the night. Lucius and his stepbrother
don't look too well. A slave stands by in case
either of them needs to vomit. With hindsight, we know Lucius' future. In 20 years' time, the Emperor Vespasian's
youngest son, Domitian, as emperor, will enact a reign of terror. Will Lucius survive? (Drums)

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar It's March the 17th in A.D. 73. We're visiting ancient Rome
to watch the Liberalia, an annual festival that celebrates
the liberty of Rome's citizens. We're looking in at a 17-year-old
named Lucius Popidius Secundus. He's not from a poor family, but he lives
in the region known as the Subura, a poorer neighborhood in Rome,
yet close to the center of the city. (Gong) The tenants of these
apartments are crammed in, (Grunting) which poses considerable risk. Fires are frequent and the smell of ash
and smoke in the morning is not uncommon. Lucius, who awoke at dawn,
has family duties to perform today. (Cheering) His 15-year-old brother is coming of age. Half the children in ancient Rome
die before they reach adulthood, so this is a particularly
important milestone. Lucius watches his brother
stand in his new toga before the household shrine
with its protective deities, as he places his bulla,
a protective amulet, in the shrine with a prayer of thanks. The bulla had worked.
It had protected him. Unlike many others,
he had survived to become an adult. At 17, Lucius has almost
completed his education. He has learned to speak well,
make public speeches, and how to read and write
both Latin and Greek. His father has taught him
the types of things you can't learn in the classroom: how to run, how to swim, and how to fight. Lucius could choose, at 17,
to become a military tribune and command soldiers
on the edge of the Empire. But in other ways,
Lucius is still a child. He's not trusted
to arrange business deals. His father will take care
of that until he is 25. And Dad will arrange Lucius' marriage
to a girl 10 years younger. His dad has his eye on a family
with a 7-year-old daughter. Back to the Liberalia. As Lucius leaves with his family, the shops are open as the population
goes about its business. The streets are full
of itinerant traders selling trinkets and people bustling from place to place. Large wagons are not allowed
in the city until after the ninth hour but the streets are still crowded. Fathers and uncles
take the kids to the Forum Augustus to see statues of Rome's famous warriors like Aeneas, who led Rome's ancestors,
the Trojans, to Italy. And Romulus, Rome's founder. And all the great generals of the Republic
from more than 100 years earlier. Lovingly, we can imagine
fathers and guardians with their now adult children remembering stories of Rome's glory and re-telling the good deeds and sayings
of the great men of the past: lessons on how to live well, and to overcome the follies of youth. There is a sense of history in this place,
relevant to their present. Romans made an empire
without end in time and space. (Thump) Rome was destined to be
eternal through warfare. Wars were a fact of life, even in A.D. 73. There are campaigns in the north
of England and into Scotland, to the north of the River
Danube into Romania, and on the frontier
between Syria and Iraq to the east. It's now the eighth hour --
time to head for the baths. Lucius and his family head up
the Via Lata, the wide street, to the Campus Martius,
and the enormous Baths of Agrippa. The family members leave
the clients and freedmen outside, and enter the baths with their peer group. Baths would change from dark,
steamy rooms to light ones. The Romans had perfected window glass. Everyone moves from the cold room to the tepid room and to the very hot room. (Man) Oops! More than an hour later, the bathers leave massaged, oiled, (Whistling) and have been scraped down with a strigil to remove the remaining dirt. At the ninth hour, seven hours
after they left home, the men return for a celebratory dinner. Dinner is an intimate affair, with nine people
reclining around the low table. Slaves attend to their every need if the diners, through gestures,
demand more food and wine. As the day closes, we can hear
the rumble of wagons outside. The clients and freedmen, with a meal of robust
-- if inferior -- food inside them, shuffle off to the now tepid baths before returning
to their apartment blocks. Back at Lucius' house,
the drinking continues into the night. Lucius and his stepbrother
don't look too well. A slave stands by in case
either of them needs to vomit. With hindsight, we know Lucius' future. In 20 years' time, the Emperor Vespasian's
youngest son, Domitian, as emperor, will enact a reign of terror. Will Lucius survive? (Drums)

Shh... I've snuck into minutephysics' studio to explain
how a wing actually works Hang on, something doesn't feel right. Ah, that's better. Now everyone knows that a wing generates lift
due to its characteristic shape Since air travels farther over top of the
wing, it must go faster than the air underneath so that both streams meet up simultaneously
at the trailing edge And according to Bernoulli's principle, faster
flowing air exerts less pressure than the slower air beneath the wing
This pressure difference creates an upward force -- lift. Job done. Right? Nope
This simple explanation taught in many textbooks and classrooms has obvious problems
Like how could a plane fly upside down? Some planes like the Wright brothers' had
nearly flat wings. So presumably air would travel the same speed
over both sides and there would be no lift Plus experiments show that air streams don't
meet up at the back of the wing. Air over the top goes significantly faster,
reaching the trailing edge first. So how does a wing actually generate lift? Well the key is the wing must deflect air
downwards This can be achieved using asymmetric or cambered
air foils Or by increasing the angle of attack
Air under the wing is deflected down And by the coanda effect
air above the wing is guided along its surface and down as well
Since the air is slowed and deflected down by the wing,
it pushes the wing up and back. Lift, and drag. This is in accordance with Newton's Third
Law of Motion But hang on, if you can explain lift only
using the deflection of air and Newton's laws, then the Bernoulli explanation must be completely
wrong Well, no,
air over the top of the wing does go faster than air beneath, creating a pressure difference
that generates lift Then this Newtonian explanation is unnecessary
rubbish and the original explanation was right! That's not true either. The original explanation incorrectly assumed
that air over and under the wing must reconnect at the trailing edge, and there was no mention
of deflecting air down. Each explanation, done correctly, completely
accounts for the lift generated by a wing. They're just two different ways of looking
at the same thing. So next time someone brings up the standard
misconception, you can tell them that explanation just doesn't fly. And if you liked that, you've gotta check
out MinutePhysics. I've got total respect for a guy who does
this every week. Sincerely, a collection of particles known
as Derek.

**Transcript**:
Shh... I've snuck into minutephysics' studio to explain
how a wing actually works Hang on, something doesn't feel right. Ah, that's better. Now everyone knows that a wing generates lift
due to its characteristic shape Since air travels farther over top of the
wing, it must go faster than the air underneath so that both streams meet up simultaneously
at the trailing edge And according to Bernoulli's principle, faster
flowing air exerts less pressure than the slower air beneath the wing
This pressure difference creates an upward force -- lift. Job done. Right? Nope
This simple explanation taught in many textbooks and classrooms has obvious problems
Like how could a plane fly upside down? Some planes like the Wright brothers' had
nearly flat wings. So presumably air would travel the same speed
over both sides and there would be no lift Plus experiments show that air streams don't
meet up at the back of the wing. Air over the top goes significantly faster,
reaching the trailing edge first. So how does a wing actually generate lift? Well the key is the wing must deflect air
downwards This can be achieved using asymmetric or cambered
air foils Or by increasing the angle of attack
Air under the wing is deflected down And by the coanda effect
air above the wing is guided along its surface and down as well
Since the air is slowed and deflected down by the wing,
it pushes the wing up and back. Lift, and drag. This is in accordance with Newton's Third
Law of Motion But hang on, if you can explain lift only
using the deflection of air and Newton's laws, then the Bernoulli explanation must be completely
wrong Well, no,
air over the top of the wing does go faster than air beneath, creating a pressure difference
that generates lift Then this Newtonian explanation is unnecessary
rubbish and the original explanation was right! That's not true either. The original explanation incorrectly assumed
that air over and under the wing must reconnect at the trailing edge, and there was no mention
of deflecting air down. Each explanation, done correctly, completely
accounts for the lift generated by a wing. They're just two different ways of looking
at the same thing. So next time someone brings up the standard
misconception, you can tell them that explanation just doesn't fly. And if you liked that, you've gotta check
out MinutePhysics. I've got total respect for a guy who does
this every week. Sincerely, a collection of particles known
as Derek.

drawing out the facts The Naked science [Music] scrapbook hello and welcome to the naked science scrapbook from the naked scientists this time we're answering the question what is a fungus we're all familiar with the toad stalls you see growing around trees and the yeast we use to make bread but these are only two examples of the diverse Kingdom of fungi there are a group of organisms completely SE separate from animals and plants and they can be unicellular like yeasts or multicellular like the mushrooms you might add to a stir fry let's take a Whistle Stop tour of some of the weird and wonderful groups of fungi and some of the interesting things that they do first of all how do they live fungi are similar to animals in the sense that they are heterotrophs this means that unlike plants they can't make their own organic carbon based compounds instead like us they have to consume them from their environment and fungi absorb the nutrients they need from anything like rotting wood leaf litter that forgotten bag of grapes lurking at the back of the fridge and even the skin between your toes The Fluffy mold you see on a slice of bread is the main body or melium of a fungus the melium is made up of a dense network of thread-like structures called hyy these look a bit like plant roots and they are how fungi take up nutrients but unlike plant roots they actively release into their local environment enzymes and other digestive chemical juices that break up compounds into simpler molecules that the fungal hyy can then take up and these hyal networks operate on a massive scale in fact The Melia of the fungi that produce the Toads you can see in Woodland can extend for hundreds of meters beneath the soil but working on its own is not always enough for a fungus to extract all of the nutrients it needs instead many team up with plants and in some cases without this relationship neither can survive without the other these interactions are known as micor the plant swaps some of the carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis in return for phosphorus magnesium and copper collected by the fungi from the soil around 90% of all families of plants form these sort of micro risal relationships from crops like wheat and barley to Orchid flowers to trees like Birch and Beach it's even been suggested that without their Mutual interactions neither plants nor fungi could have colonized the land so what are toad stores and mushrooms these are the fungal fruiting bodies they release spores that can either germinate on their own to form a new individual by asexual reproduction all the spores can join together to form a new organism thereby reproducing sexually having the flexibility to reproduce asexually or sexually is a great advantage that allows fungi to exploit stable conditions or adapt to changing ones and of course some of these toad stores are also edible species like morels shantells and giant puff balls as well as the cultivated field mushrooms you buy in the supermarket all make excellent additions to the dinner table and though I wouldn't advise eating some species because of the Psychedelic effects they may have fungi are an important part of food and drink production in other ways too corn is made from the fusarium fungus and a form of aspis mold is essential for soy sauce and miso production in Japan cheese lovers lives wouldn't be the same without molds in the penicilium genus like P glum to make the blue veins and pungent odors of blue cheeses and of course we use yeast to turn grains and water into bread and Grains fruit or even potatoes into alcohol yeasts are single celled fungi that reproduce asexually by budding the Next Generation simply Bud off the pair rather than releasing spores like the toad stores we met earlier when the yeast feeds off molto sugar in flour maltt or mashed fruit it produces carbon dioxide plus water if there's plenty of oxygen and alcohol if there's no Oxygen fungi aren't always good for us though the infection athletes foot is caused by fungi that feed on the Keratin in skin nails and hair patients with AIDS are susceptible to potentially fatal fungal lung infections and many women and men around the world have experienced the discomfort of thrush caused by the candida Albans fungus but they can also provide us with ways of fighting disease in order to stop bacteria and other fungi from invading their patch many fungi produce chemicals that can stop other microorganisms in their tracts and it was by isolating these chemicals that we developed some

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the Constitutional Convention in 1787, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about yeast.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one that is somewhat similar in structure, I would say Question 3, but this is a very weak match and not a good one.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are relevant to the topic of yeast and fungi, and then try to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the new generated MCQs.

If you provide new generated MCQs that are relevant to the topic, I would be happy to help you match the ground truth MCQ with one of the new generated MCQs.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Most people have heard the word "gerrymandering" once or twice, probably during a presidential election. What exactly is gerrymandering? Essentially, it's the process of giving one political party an advantage over another political party by redrawing district lines. It's like Democrats trying to gain an advantage over Republicans, or Republicans trying to gain an advantage over Democrats. You see, each party wants to gain as many districts as possible so they can do things like control the state budget, or set themselves up to win even more districts in the future. So to understand how this process began, and how it continues today, we must go back to 1812 in Massachusetts.  Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts, supported and signed a bill to allow redistricting. That is, redrawing the boundaries that separate districts. The catch? The new lines would favor Gerry's own political party, the Democratic-Republican party, which no longer exists. You see, Gerry wanted his party to win as many state Senate seats as possible. The more members of your party who vote, the more likely you are to win an election. The new lines were drawn to include loads of areas that would help Governor Gerry in the future. They were so strange looking that someone said the new districts looked like a salamander. The Boston Gazette added Gerry's name to the word salamander, and voilà! Gerrymandering, the process of dividing up and redrawing districts to give your political party an advantage. So how exactly does someone go about protecting their own political party, and actually gerrymandering a district? There are two successful practices. Packing a district, and cracking a district. Packing is the process of drawing district lines and packing in your opponents like cattle, into as few districts as possible. If more districts equals more votes, the fewer the districts there are, the fewer votes the opposition party will get. Packing, then, decreases the opponent's voter strength and influence. Cracking is the opposite: taking one district and cracking it into several pieces. This is usually done in districts where your opponent has many supporters. Cracking spreads these supporters out among many districts, denying your opponent a lot of votes. When you have a large number of people who would generally vote for one type of party, those folks are known as a voting bloc. Cracking is a way to break that all up. So when would a party choose to pack their opponent's districts rather than crack them? Well, that really depends on what the party needs. To dilute your opponent's voters, you could pack them into one district and leave the surrounding districts filled with voters of your own party. Or, if you and your party are in power when it's time to redraw district lines, you could redraw districts and crack up a powerful district and spread your opponent's voters out across several neighboring districts. So, Governor Gerry in 1812 wanted to gain an advantage for his party, and redrew district lines in his state in such a crazy way we have a whole new word and way of thinking about how political parties can gain advantages over their opponents. Politicians think of creative ways to draw districts every few years. So the next time an election comes around, and politicians ask people to vote, be sure to look up the shape of your district and the districts that surround it. How wide does your district stretch across your state? Are all of the districts in your state relatively the same shape? How many other districts does your district touch? But always be sure to ask yourself, does my district look like a salamander?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What exactly is gerrymandering?
Options: A. Basically, it's finding fault in the incumbent., B. First of all, it's a theory with no practical realizations., C. Literally, it's when "gerries" (or political lobbyists) meander through the opposing party's fundraising initiatives., D. Essentially, it's the process of giving one political party the advantage over another political party.
Correct Option: D

Question 7: Who was the last Roman Emperor to defend Constantinople? Options: A. Constantine the 10th, B. Constantine the 9th, C. Constantine XI, D. Constantine the 11th Correct Option: C

However, please note that this is a very weak match, as the content and intent of the question are quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs based on the provided transcript, which would likely result in a much stronger match. 

If you would like, I can try generating new MCQs based on the provided transcript and then identify the most similar one to the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Most people have heard the word "gerrymandering" once or twice, probably during a presidential election. What exactly is gerrymandering? Essentially, it's the process of giving one political party an advantage over another political party by redrawing district lines. It's like Democrats trying to gain an advantage over Republicans, or Republicans trying to gain an advantage over Democrats. You see, each party wants to gain as many districts as possible so they can do things like control the state budget, or set themselves up to win even more districts in the future. So to understand how this process began, and how it continues today, we must go back to 1812 in Massachusetts.  Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts, supported and signed a bill to allow redistricting. That is, redrawing the boundaries that separate districts. The catch? The new lines would favor Gerry's own political party, the Democratic-Republican party, which no longer exists. You see, Gerry wanted his party to win as many state Senate seats as possible. The more members of your party who vote, the more likely you are to win an election. The new lines were drawn to include loads of areas that would help Governor Gerry in the future. They were so strange looking that someone said the new districts looked like a salamander. The Boston Gazette added Gerry's name to the word salamander, and voilà! Gerrymandering, the process of dividing up and redrawing districts to give your political party an advantage. So how exactly does someone go about protecting their own political party, and actually gerrymandering a district? There are two successful practices. Packing a district, and cracking a district. Packing is the process of drawing district lines and packing in your opponents like cattle, into as few districts as possible. If more districts equals more votes, the fewer the districts there are, the fewer votes the opposition party will get. Packing, then, decreases the opponent's voter strength and influence. Cracking is the opposite: taking one district and cracking it into several pieces. This is usually done in districts where your opponent has many supporters. Cracking spreads these supporters out among many districts, denying your opponent a lot of votes. When you have a large number of people who would generally vote for one type of party, those folks are known as a voting bloc. Cracking is a way to break that all up. So when would a party choose to pack their opponent's districts rather than crack them? Well, that really depends on what the party needs. To dilute your opponent's voters, you could pack them into one district and leave the surrounding districts filled with voters of your own party. Or, if you and your party are in power when it's time to redraw district lines, you could redraw districts and crack up a powerful district and spread your opponent's voters out across several neighboring districts. So, Governor Gerry in 1812 wanted to gain an advantage for his party, and redrew district lines in his state in such a crazy way we have a whole new word and way of thinking about how political parties can gain advantages over their opponents. Politicians think of creative ways to draw districts every few years. So the next time an election comes around, and politicians ask people to vote, be sure to look up the shape of your district and the districts that surround it. How wide does your district stretch across your state? Are all of the districts in your state relatively the same shape? How many other districts does your district touch? But always be sure to ask yourself, does my district look like a salamander?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the history of Constantinople, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the origin of the word "gerrymandering".

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the generated MCQ that is least dissimilar is:

 Question 11: What was the name of the Roman Emperor who moved the capital to Constantinople? 

Only because this question is also asking for the name of a historical figure, but the content and intent are completely different.

Please note that this is not a good match, and the generated MCQs need to be revised to match the ground truth MCQs.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Dialogue gives a story color, makes it exciting and moves it forward. Romeo: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? Juliet: What satisfaction canst thou have tonight? Romeo: The exchange of thy love's faithful vows for mine. Without dialogue: (cricket sounds) So what goes into writing effective dialogue? Well, there are social skills: making friends, solving conflicts, being pleasant and polite. We won't be using any of those today. Instead, we'll be working on -- let's call them "anti-social skills." If you're a writer, you may already have a few of these. The first is eavesdropping. If you're riding a bus and hear an interesting conversation, you could write it all down. Of course, when you write fiction, you're not describing real people, you're making up characters. But sometimes the words you overhear can give you ideas. "I did not," says one person. "I saw you," the other replies. Who might be saying those words? Maybe it's two kids in a class, and the boy thinks the girl pushed him. Maybe it's a couple, but one of them is a vampire, and the woman vampire saw the man flirting with a zombie. Or maybe not. Maybe the characters are a teenager and his mother, and they're supposed to be vegetarians, but the mother saw him eating a burger. So let's say you've decided on some characters. This is anti-social skill number two: start pretending they're real. What are they like? Where are they from? What music do they listen to? Spend some time with them. If you're on a bus, think about what they might be doing if they were there too. Would they talk on the phone, listen to music, draw pictures, sleep? What we say depends on who we are. An older person might speak differently than a younger person. Someone from the south might speak differently than someone from the north. Once you know your characters, you can figure out how they talk. At this stage, it's helpful to use anti-social skill number three: muttering to yourself. When you speak your character's words, you can hear whether they sound natural, and fix them if necessary. Remember, most people are usually pretty informal when they speak. They use simple language and contractions. So, "Do not attempt to lie to me" sounds more natural as "Don't try to lie to me." Also keep it short. People tend to speak in short bursts, not lengthy speeches. And let the dialogue do the work. Ask yourself: do I really need that adverb? For instance, "'Your money or your life,' she said threateningly." Here, "threateningly" is redundant, so you can get rid of it. But if the words and the actions don't match, an adverb can be helpful. "'Your money or your life,' she said lovingly." So, to recap: First, eavesdrop. Next, pretend imaginary people are real. Finally, mutter to yourself, and write it all down. You already have everything you need. This is fictional dialogue, or "How to Hear Voices in Your Head."

If you're on a bus, think about what they might be doing if they were there too. Would they talk on the phone, listen to music, draw pictures, sleep? What we say depends on who we are. An older person might speak differently than a younger person. Someone from the south might speak differently than someone from the north. Once you know your characters, you can figure out how they talk. At this stage, it's helpful to use anti-social skill number three: muttering to yourself. When you speak your character's words, you can hear whether they sound natural, and fix them if necessary. Remember, most people are usually pretty informal when they speak. They use simple language and contractions. So, "Do not attempt to lie to me" sounds more natural as "Don't try to lie to me." Also keep it short. People tend to speak in short bursts, not lengthy speeches. And let the dialogue do the work. Ask yourself: do I really need that adverb? For instance, "'Your money or your life,' she said threateningly." Here, "threateningly" is redundant, so you can get rid of it. But if the words and the actions don't match, an adverb can be helpful. "'Your money or your life,' she said lovingly." So, to recap: First, eavesdrop. Next, pretend imaginary people are real. Finally, mutter to yourself, and write it all down. You already have everything you need. This is fictional dialogue, or "How to Hear Voices in Your Head."

Romeo: The exchange of thy love's faithful vows for mine. Without dialogue: (cricket sounds) So what goes into writing effective dialogue? Well, there are social skills: making friends, solving conflicts, being pleasant and polite. We won't be using any of those today. Instead, we'll be working on -- let's call them "anti-social skills." If you're a writer, you may already have a few of these. The first is eavesdropping. If you're riding a bus and hear an interesting conversation, you could write it all down. Of course, when you write fiction, you're not describing real people, you're making up characters. But sometimes the words you overhear can give you ideas. "I did not," says one person. "I saw you," the other replies. Who might be saying those words? Maybe it's two kids in a class, and the boy thinks the girl pushed him. Maybe it's a couple, but one of them is a vampire, and the woman vampire saw the man flirting with a zombie. Or maybe not. Maybe the characters are a teenager and his mother, and they're supposed to be vegetarians, but the mother saw him eating a burger. So let's say you've decided on some characters. This is anti-social skill number two: start pretending they're real. What are they like? Where are they from? What music do they listen to? Spend some time with them.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You step into an elevator. It starts going down, fast. What would happen if you jumped right when it started going down? Would the ceiling hit your head? Ouch! Do you stay suspended in the air while the elevator plummets down? Let's examine the elevator problem one step at a time. First, consider a scale. You know, the kind of scale you weigh yourself on. When you step on a scale to weigh yourself, there are two forces involved. One, gravity pulls you down. Two, the scale pushes you up. What? You didn't know a scale could push? Of course it can! If it didn't push up on you, you would go crashing through the floor. This upward push is called the normal force and yes, it is normally there. Since you're just standing there on the scale, you're not moving. Therefore, you're not accelerating. Newton's second law of motion -- net force equals mass times acceleration -- tells us that if the acceleration equals zero, the net force must equal zero. Which means that the force of gravity pulling you down must be equal to the force of the scale pushing you up. Now let's suppose you're standing on that scale in an elevator. At first, the elevator is standing still, so you and the scale are standing still. The two forces on you are equal and opposite. You can read how hard the scale is pushing by looking at it. We call that your weight. Then, the elevator starts falling down. You and the scale are in the elevator, so you are falling down too, faster and faster. That means you are accelerating downward. Now there is a net force in the same direction as the acceleration -- down. Since gravity hasn't changed, that must mean the scale isn't pushing up as hard. So the scale is reading a smaller number. The faster the elevator accelerates, the less the scale pushes up. What if you jumped? Would you stop falling? Would the elevator hit your head? Well, what's pulling the elevator down? Gravity. Is gravity pulling on you? Of course. So your relative position in the elevator will stay the same. The ceiling will only hit you if you can jump up to the ceiling. Now consider: what would happen if the elevator accelerated upward and, even more frightening, if someone snuck in and cut the cable holding the elevator, what would happen then? Think about it.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: When you step on a scale to weigh yourself, there are two forces involved. What are they?
Options: A. The force of gravity and the normal force, B. The force of weight and the force of resistance, C. The normal force and the force of resistance, D. The quantum force and the force of gravity
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: According to the transcript, what is the purpose of a scale pushing up on you when you step on it?

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You step into an elevator. It starts going down, fast. What would happen if you jumped right when it started going down? Would the ceiling hit your head? Ouch! Do you stay suspended in the air while the elevator plummets down? Let's examine the elevator problem one step at a time. First, consider a scale. You know, the kind of scale you weigh yourself on. When you step on a scale to weigh yourself, there are two forces involved. One, gravity pulls you down. Two, the scale pushes you up. What? You didn't know a scale could push? Of course it can! If it didn't push up on you, you would go crashing through the floor. This upward push is called the normal force and yes, it is normally there. Since you're just standing there on the scale, you're not moving. Therefore, you're not accelerating. Newton's second law of motion -- net force equals mass times acceleration -- tells us that if the acceleration equals zero, the net force must equal zero. Which means that the force of gravity pulling you down must be equal to the force of the scale pushing you up. Now let's suppose you're standing on that scale in an elevator. At first, the elevator is standing still, so you and the scale are standing still. The two forces on you are equal and opposite. You can read how hard the scale is pushing by looking at it. We call that your weight. Then, the elevator starts falling down. You and the scale are in the elevator, so you are falling down too, faster and faster. That means you are accelerating downward. Now there is a net force in the same direction as the acceleration -- down. Since gravity hasn't changed, that must mean the scale isn't pushing up as hard. So the scale is reading a smaller number. The faster the elevator accelerates, the less the scale pushes up. What if you jumped? Would you stop falling? Would the elevator hit your head? Well, what's pulling the elevator down? Gravity. Is gravity pulling on you? Of course. So your relative position in the elevator will stay the same. The ceiling will only hit you if you can jump up to the ceiling. Now consider: what would happen if the elevator accelerated upward and, even more frightening, if someone snuck in and cut the cable holding the elevator, what would happen then? Think about it.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: If you are on a scale inside a falling elevator, what do you think will most likely happen?
Options: A. The normal force doesn't change, but the force of gravity does. It appears, according to the scale, that you weigh more., B.

It appears, according to the scale, that you weigh the same., D. The force of gravity doesn't change, but the normal force does. It appears, according to the scale, that you weigh more.
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: If you are standing on a scale in an elevator that is accelerating downward, what will the scale read?

**Transcript**:
 So why does this turn
into this in the fall? I live in Boston, which
means that about this time each year, the
leaves on the trees start to turn their colors. Leaves get their color
from three main compounds. The first is chlorophyll,
which might sound familiar. Chlorophyll is involved
in photosynthesis, which is the process
by which plants turn CO2 and water
into sugar and oxygen by harnessing the
energy from the sun. Chlorophyll gives most plants
their distinctive green color. The second group of compounds
are the carotenoids, which sounds a little bit
like carrot, which makes sense because carotenoids give leaves
there yellow and orange hues. Carotenoids are present with
chlorophyll in organelles called chloroplasts year round. And these chloroplasts
are just the organelles where photosynthesis occurs. Finally, there's a
group of compounds known as anthocyanins. And anthocyanins give
plants reddish hues. And they're often
found in things like cranberries,
and blueberries, and lots of dark red leaves. These anthocyanins
are actually produced in the fall when chlorophyll
starts to break down, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Now, for most of the
year, chlorophyll is so bright green
that it blocks out some of the yellow
and orange hues coming from the carotenoids. For most of the growing
season, chlorophyll is constantly being broken
down and reproduced. But as it starts
to get colder out, the cool night air closes
off the veins of the leaves. And it gets harder for
water and nutrients to move into the chloroplasts
and rebuild chlorophyll. So what this means is
that the chlorophyll is being broken down, but
it's not being reproduced. So the green color of the
leaves starts to disappear. This means that the yellows and
the oranges of the carotenoids can start to show through. But that's not all. Anthocyanins, by contrast,
are not present year round in the leaves. Instead, they are actively
produced in the fall right before the leaves
drop off the trees. So why would a
plant suddenly want to start producing a red
pigment in a leaf that's about to drop off anyways? Scientists haven't reached
a definitive conclusion yet. But they do have some
pretty good ideas. One is that the red pigments act
as a sort of direct sunscreen as the canopy starts
to drop leaves. The leaves that remain
are exposed to more light. And those leaves are losing
the sunlight-absorbing powers of their chlorophyll. Another cool idea is that the
red pigment might actually trick migrating insects into
thinking that the tree is unhealthy and discouraging
them from laying their eggs on those trees. So all of this leads us to
some pretty cool science that you can do at home to
visualize the pigments found in leaves where you live. So all you need
for this experiment is isopropyl alcohol, some
strips of filter paper-- I used coffee filters-- a couple glasses,
scissors, and some leaves. And if you want
to be super cool, pick a few different
kinds of leaves, so that you can compare the
compounds you find within them. Step one, chop each of your
kinds of leaves up into lots of little tiny pieces. We really want to release
all of these compounds out of the leaves. So the smaller and the
finer you chop them, the better this
is going to work. Next, cover the leaves
in isopropyl alcohol. Now, this is just
rubbing alcohol, so it's not very dangerous. But you do want to make sure
you don't get this in your eyes or drink it. The next step is to grind up
these leaves in the alcohol. Now, ideally, you would be doing
this with a mortar and pestle. but I don't have that. And so I am using
a wooden spoon. Now, at this point,
you should start to see the alcohol change colors
as those pigments are released from the leaves. If you want to speed
this reaction up a bit, you can set all of your
glasses into a hot water bath and leave them for
about 30 minutes. After this, you can really
see the color change in the alcohol. Now, I strained the
leaves out of my alcohol, so that it was a
little easier to see. But you could probably
leave them in there as well. Next, cut your filter
paper into strips and place a strip into each
glass so that one side of it is touching the alcohol and the
other side is out in the air. Now, I repeated this
experiment later with longer strips
of filter paper and hung one side
out of the edge. And this actually worked
a little bit better. Now, you want to let your
glasses sit for about an hour. So what we're doing here
is called chromatography, which just means that we
are separating a mixture. Here, we are using
paper chromatography to separate the different
compounds within the leaves. So the alcohol,
our mobile phase, is being drawn up the paper
strip, our stationary phase, and it's pulling leaf
pigments along with it. Depending on their
chemical structure, molecules will have
different polarities and will want to interact
with that paper differently. Some will want to stick
tightly onto the paper, while others will move more
easily with the liquid. This means that some compounds
will travel along the paper faster than others, separating
the compounds along the strip, and giving you distinct
bands of compounds. Cool. So we actually got some
really good separation between the yellow
carotenoids on top and the green chlorophyll
on the bottom. And the longer you leave these,
the better that separation will get. Now, this is an experiment
you can easily do at home, and you should. I want to see what the
compounds from leaves from all around the world look like. So make a video response of
you doing this experiment, and leave it below. And I'll check them all out. And yeah, go on. Go forth. Do science.

Caffeine a legal stimulant that most of us are pretty familiar with, many of us use every day, and some of us are addicted to. If you are a caffeine user, you probably know your limits. For me one small cup of coffee in the morning can help keep me alert and focused, whereas  two small cups of coffee in the morning can turn me into a cat on catnip. Well for the purposes of this video and to best demonstrate the physical and mental effects of caffeine, I'm going to get very very caffeinated very very fast. For science. Go big or go home. Caffeine is a stimulant drug that acts on your central nervous system. Because caffeine is both lipid and water soluble it  can easily pass through the blood-brain barrier and act on the interior of your brain Once there, caffeine works by diminishing the effect of a neurotransmitter called adenosine. Adenosine acts as a suppressor for your nervous system, reducing neural activity and slowing everything down. Caffeine and adenosine have similar shapes so caffeine can bind to the same neuroreceptors that adenosine does. But because caffeine is not adenosine, it doesn't turn these neuroreceptors on. This is called competitive inhibition. Caffeine competes with adenosine to bind with the same receptors, And because caffeine is bound, adenosine cannot bind and its effects are inhibited. Long story short, caffeine prevents adenosine from slowing down your nervous system. So this explain part of why you feel more awake, alert and active with caffeine flowing through your veins. But adenosine inhibition isn't the only thing that caffeine does. Oh no. Caffeine also stimulates the production of adrenaline or epinephrine. Adrenaline is a pretty well known hormone involved in the fight-or-flight response. It causes all sort of physiological reactions! It increases your heart rate, increases the blood flow to your muscles, opens up your airways, causes your blood
pressure to rise, and also causes you're  your liver to release extra sugar into your blood stream for an added boost of energy. It also causes your muscle to tighten up, which would be useful if you were the lone human on the savannah, deciding or not to fight or flee from that lion over the distance, But as a modern twenty something sitting in from of my camera, it just give me the jitters. Finally caffeine also plays with the dopamine levels in your brain. Awesome, yeah. Caffeine increases the amount of dopamine present in your brain by slowing down its reabsorption, Much in the same way that cocaine increases the amount of dopamine present by slowing down how quickly it can be sucked back into your brain tissue. This means that caffeine also makes you feel good and this interaction with dopamine is how you can actually build a caffeine addiction. So now you're a happy, jittery, fight or flight ready bundle caffeine! Now what? Well the now what really depends on how your specific body metabolizes caffeine. The average half-life of caffeine in the human body is about six hours. so this means that if you have two hundred milligrams of caffeine in your average cup of coffee at 9am in the morning, then 6 hours later half of that will be left, so at 3pm you will have a hundred milligrams of caffeine left, and then another 6 hours later you will have half of the hundred you will have half of the hundred so you will have 50 milligrams of caffeine left at 9 o'clock at night. But dude, who stops at just one cup of coffee? Not this chick. So how much caffeine is too much caffeine? A lethal dose of caffeine is about two hundred milligrams per kilogram so it would take about nine thousand five hundred milligrams of caffeine to kill me. Now, there are about two hundred milligrams of caffeine in a standard cup of coffee, so that's about forty eight cups of coffee, which is a surprisingly low number, but I would have to drink all 48 of those before my body started to metabolize the caffeine, which means I would literally have to chug 48 cups of coffee. I literally wouldn't be able to drink that much coffee, both because my stomach couldn't hold that volume of liquid and also because as every coffee drinker knows, caffeine is a diuretic. before I got to cup forty anyways, the stimulant effect of caffeine would be  jacked up so high that that the alertness and awakeness would be transformed into mania,  disorientation and hallucinations... great! What would eventually kill you would be ventricular fibrillation, which basically means  that your heart would caffeine jitter itself to death. So moral of the story, caffeine is a drug. It is a stimulant that has some pretty noticeable effects on your body, can cause addiction, and, in high enough doses, can kill you. So caffeinate wisely! Go forth, do science! My hand is actually not shaking too bad right now. Don't try this at home, I know a lot of people do drink that much caffeine all on one day and  sometimes I approach it,  but I certainly don't do it over the span of 20 minutes. I actually don't feel as terrible as I thought I would have after that amount, but I certainly don't feel good either.

Caffeine a legal stimulant that most of us are pretty familiar with, many of us use every day, and some of us are addicted to. If you are a caffeine user, you probably know your limits. For me one small cup of coffee in the morning can help keep me alert and focused, whereas  two small cups of coffee in the morning can turn me into a cat on catnip. Well for the purposes of this video and to best demonstrate the physical and mental effects of caffeine, I'm going to get very very caffeinated very very fast. For science. Go big or go home. Caffeine is a stimulant drug that acts on your central nervous system. Because caffeine is both lipid and water soluble it  can easily pass through the blood-brain barrier and act on the interior of your brain Once there, caffeine works by diminishing the effect of a neurotransmitter called adenosine. Adenosine acts as a suppressor for your nervous system, reducing neural activity and slowing everything down. Caffeine and adenosine have similar shapes so caffeine can bind to the same neuroreceptors that adenosine does. But because caffeine is not adenosine, it doesn't turn these neuroreceptors on. This is called competitive inhibition. Caffeine competes with adenosine to bind with the same receptors, And because caffeine is bound, adenosine cannot bind and its effects are inhibited. Long story short, caffeine prevents adenosine from slowing down your nervous system. So this explain part of why you feel more awake, alert and active with caffeine flowing through your veins. But adenosine inhibition isn't the only thing that caffeine does. Oh no. Caffeine also stimulates the production of adrenaline or epinephrine. Adrenaline is a pretty well known hormone involved in the fight-or-flight response. It causes all sort of physiological reactions! It increases your heart rate, increases the blood flow to your muscles, opens up your airways, causes your blood
pressure to rise, and also causes you're  your liver to release extra sugar into your blood stream for an added boost of energy.

Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar She's only a few feet away. The closer he gets, the more nervous he becomes, the budding zit on his nose growing bigger and bigger until it practically eclipses his face. She looks at him hovering nearby, sees the massive zit, and giggles. He slumps away, feeling sick. Stress can sure make a mess, and it happens to both teens and adults. But how does it happen? Let's rewind to before the zit, to before Justin even sees his crush. Already late for school, Justin got to class just in time to hear the teacher say "pop quiz." He hadn't done his homework the night before, and felt more unprepared than the ambushed World War II soldiers he was supposed to write about. A sudden rush of panic swept over his body, leaving him with sweaty palms, a foggy mind and a racing heart. He stumbled out of class in a daze, and ran straight into his all-time crush, spiking up his stress. Stress is a general biological response to a potential danger. In primitive caveman terms, stress can make you fight for your life, or run for your life, if, for example, you're confronted by a hungry saber-tooth tiger. Special chemicals called stress hormones run through your body, giving you more oxygen and power to run away from danger or to face it and fight for your life, hence the term "fight or flight." But when you don't fight, or take flight, you face the plight. When we're taking final exams, sitting in traffic or pondering pollution, we internalize stress. It all begins in the brain. The hypothalamus, the master controller of your hormones, releases something called corticotropin-releasing hormone. This triggers the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland found at the base of the brain, to release adrenocorticotropic hormone which then stimulates the adrenal gland sitting on top of the kidneys to release cortisol, the major stress hormone. These natural chemicals are a great help when you need to run away quickly, or do superhuman feats of courage, but when you're simply sitting, these stress hormones collect in the body and affect your overall health. Stress hormones increase inflammation in the body, suppress the immune system, which makes you more susceptible to infection by acne-causing bacteria, and can even increase oil production in the skin. And this is the perfect storm for forming a pimple. Cortisol is a major stress hormone involved in making skin cells churn out oily lipids from special glands called sebaceous glands. But when there's too much of these oily lipids, called sebum, they can plug up the swollen, inflamed pores and trap the pesky, acne-causing bacteria inside, where they set up house and thrive. Add a dash of inflammatory neuropeptides released by the nervous system when you're -- well, nervous -- and angry zits follow. To make matters worse, Justin is a boy, meaning he's got more testosterone than girls. Testosterone is another hormone that increases oil production in the skin. So, his already oily skin, together with a boost in oil and inflammation from stress, is the perfect environment for bacteria to swell, swell, swell up into a major zit. So what could've Justin done to avoid the big pimple? Stressful situations are unavoidable. But we can try to change our responses so that we're not so stressed in the end. And had he been confident in approaching her, she might not have noticed the pimple, or he might not have had one.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What male hormone also increases oil production?
Options: A. Estrogen, B. Cortisol, C. Testosterone, D. Progesterone

Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Literary critic Northrop Frye once observed that in our primitive days, our literary heroes were -- well, nearly gods, and as civilization advanced, they came down the mountain of the gods, so to speak, and became more human, more flawed, less heroic. From the divine heroes like Hercules, down the mountain below the miraculous but mortal heroes such as Beowulf, the great leaders such as King Arthur, and the great but flawed heroes like Macbeth or Othello. Below even the unlikely but eventual heroes such as Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, or Hiccup, until we reach the bottom and meet the anti-hero. Contrary to the sound, the anti-hero is not the villain, not the antagonist. The anti-hero is actually the main character in some contemporary works of literature. Guy Montag in "Fahrenheit 451," Winston Smith in "1984," who unwittingly ends up challenging those in power -- that is, those who abuse their power to brainwash the populace to believe that the ills of society have been eliminated. Ideally, those who challenge the establishment should be wise, confident, brave, physically strong, with a type of charisma that inpires followers. The anti-hero, however, at best demonstrates a few underdeveloped traits, at worst, is totally inept. The story of the anti-hero usually unfolds something like this. The anti-hero initially conforms, ignorantly accepting the established views, a typical, unquestioning, brainwashed member of society. The anti-hero struggles to conform, all the while starting to object, perhaps finding other outsiders with whom to voice his questions, and naïvely, unwisely, sharing those questions with an authority figure. The anti-hero openly challenges society, and tries to fight against the lies and tactics used to oppress the populace. This step, for the anti-hero, is seldom a matter of brave, wise and heroic opposition. Maybe the anti-hero fights and succeeds in destroying the oppressive government, with a lot of impossible luck. Perhaps he or she runs away, escapes to fight another day. All too often though, the anti-hero is killed, or brainwashed to return to conformity with the masses. No heroic triumph here, no brave individual standing up against impersonal institutions of a modern world, inspiring others to fight, or resourcefully outwitting and outgunning the massive army of the evil empire. Our storytelling ancestors calmed our fears of powerlessness by giving us Hercules and other heroes strong enough to fight off the demons and monsters that we suspected haunted the night beyond our campfires. But eventually, we realized the monsters did not lie out there, they reside inside of us. Beowulf's greatest enemy was mortality. Othello's, jealousy. Hiccup, self-doubt. And in the tales of the ineffectual anti-hero, in the stories of Guy Montag and Winston Smith, lie the warnings of contemporary storytellers playing on very primitive fears: that we are not strong enough to defeat the monsters. Only this time, not the monsters chased away by the campfire, but the very monsters who built the campfire in the first place.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Literary critic Northrop Frye once observed that in our primitive days, our literary heroes were -- well, nearly gods, and as civilization advanced, they came down the mountain of the gods, so to speak, and became more human, more flawed, less heroic. From the divine heroes like Hercules, down the mountain below the miraculous but mortal heroes such as Beowulf, the great leaders such as King Arthur, and the great but flawed heroes like Macbeth or Othello. Below even the unlikely but eventual heroes such as Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, or Hiccup, until we reach the bottom and meet the anti-hero. Contrary to the sound, the anti-hero is not the villain, not the antagonist. The anti-hero is actually the main character in some contemporary works of literature. Guy Montag in "Fahrenheit 451," Winston Smith in "1984," who unwittingly ends up challenging those in power -- that is, those who abuse their power to brainwash the populace to believe that the ills of society have been eliminated. Ideally, those who challenge the establishment should be wise, confident, brave, physically strong, with a type of charisma that inpires followers. The anti-hero, however, at best demonstrates a few underdeveloped traits, at worst, is totally inept. The story of the anti-hero usually unfolds something like this. The anti-hero initially conforms, ignorantly accepting the established views, a typical, unquestioning, brainwashed member of society. The anti-hero struggles to conform, all the while starting to object, perhaps finding other outsiders with whom to voice his questions, and naïvely, unwisely, sharing those questions with an authority figure. The anti-hero openly challenges society, and tries to fight against the lies and tactics used to oppress the populace. This step, for the anti-hero, is seldom a matter of brave, wise and heroic opposition. Maybe the anti-hero fights and succeeds in destroying the oppressive government, with a lot of impossible luck. Perhaps he or she runs away, escapes to fight another day. All too often though, the anti-hero is killed, or brainwashed to return to conformity with the masses. No heroic triumph here, no brave individual standing up against impersonal institutions of a modern world, inspiring others to fight, or resourcefully outwitting and outgunning the massive army of the evil empire. Our storytelling ancestors calmed our fears of powerlessness by giving us Hercules and other heroes strong enough to fight off the demons and monsters that we suspected haunted the night beyond our campfires. But eventually, we realized the monsters did not lie out there, they reside inside of us. Beowulf's greatest enemy was mortality. Othello's, jealousy. Hiccup, self-doubt. And in the tales of the ineffectual anti-hero, in the stories of Guy Montag and Winston Smith, lie the warnings of contemporary storytellers playing on very primitive fears: that we are not strong enough to defeat the monsters. Only this time, not the monsters chased away by the campfire, but the very monsters who built the campfire in the first place.

**Transcript**:
Dear Mr. President, Do you know much about physics? I mean, you're the President of the United
States: a country with five thousand nuclear weapons, birthplace of the world's computing
and telecommunications industry, home of the first atomic clock and creator of the global
positioning system. But chances are, if you just took regular
American high school physics, you don't know one iota about the science behind these things
(No offense). That's because high school physics students
across most of America are not required to learn about pretty much any physical phenomena
discovered or explained more recently than 1865. Yes, 1865. That's the year the civil war ended and well
over a decade before Albert Einstein was even born! You know what can happen in 150 years, Mr.
President? A lot. Velcro, for one. But let me list some useful and important
ideas of the last 150 years of physics that aren't a required part of most standard US
high school physics courses: Photons. The structure of atoms. The existence of Antimatter. GPS. Lasers. Transistors. Diodes and LEDs. Quarks. Chaos Theory. Electron Microscopy. MRI scanning. The Big Bang. Black Holes. Star formation. The fact that gravity bends light. The fact that the universe is expanding. The Higgs Boson and the weak and strong nuclear
forces and all the rest of quantum mechanics and relativity and the topic of every single
Nobel Prize in Physics since… always. Basically, most of the important stuff. I mean, Mr. President, imagine if history
classes didn't talk about the abolition of slavery, world wars I or II, the great depression,
the rise of the US as a global superpower, the cold war or the civil rights movement
or heaven forbid the first African American President. Or imagine if biology classes didn't talk
about DNA, or hormones, or cell reproduction or the modern germ theory of disease or ecology. Or if geologists didn't talk about plate tectonics. And computer scientists… well… in 1865 a computer was a person who
computed your taxes. Now, if you were lucky enough to have an ambitious
teacher or take Advanced Placement Physics, then you might have learned about some of
Einstein's discoveries of 1905! Yes! Current events! But learning about how Einstein's work helped
set the stage for a century of amazing developments in our understanding of the universe is not
a part of the standard curriculum. So why, Mr. President, am I addressing this
letter to you? Well, you appoint the Secretary of Education,
for one - and I do believe that high school physics is somewhat related to education. Now, maybe your education secretary says,
"ancient physics is already hard to teach to high schoolers. And you want us to teach them modern physics
which is even harder?! Students can't really appreciate the beauty
of modern physics without fancy college level mathematics." RUBBISH. Ever heard of Carl Sagan? Richard Feynman? Or Neil deGrasse Tyson? These great men have been 100% committed to
the appreciation and dissemination of the awesomeness of the universe. And we should be too. How else are we supposed to foster and find
our future brilliant innovators, inventors, and explorers? How can we expect to educate our citizens
for the next century if we don't teach about the last? And that's not to say that we should ignore
math, either - on the contrary, math is one of the most beautiful and awesome things in
the universe, especially because it allows us to understand the universe. In particular, the last 150 years have borne
fruit to perhaps the most drastic changes in our understanding of the universe, ever,
and these new ways of thinking and solving problems should be the centerpiece of an education
in physics. Between you and me, Mr. President, I think
we'd better start making physics education more awesome here in the US, otherwise the
next Carl Sagan or Richard Feynman will come from somewhere with more educational foresight
- maybe even, the Internet. Sincerely, A collection of atoms known as Henry ps you're probably super busy, but if you'd
like to hear about physics education across the Atlantic, I highly recommend heading over
to Brady's channel, Sixty Symbols, for a perspective from the UK. I bet you'll enjoy it.

Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The universe contains about 100 billion galaxies. Each of those galaxies contains about 100 billion stars. Many of those stars have planets orbiting them. So how do we look for life in all that immensity? It's like searching for a needle in trillions of haystacks. We might want to focus our search on planets that we know can support life as we know it -- what we call habitable worlds. What do such planets look like? To answer that question, we don't look out there. Instead, we look at ourselves. At Earth. Because this is the one planet in the universe that we know for certain is habitable. When we look at Earth from space, we see a blue, watery world. It's no coincidence that three quarters of the surface is covered by oceans. Because of its unique chemical and physical properties, water is absolutely essential for all life as we know it. And so we get especially excited about other worlds on which water is abundant. Fortunately, water is very common in the universe. But life needs water in the form of liquid, not ice, and not vapor, and that's a little bit less common. For a planet to have liquid water at its surface, three things are important. First, the planet needs to be large enough that the force of gravity keeps the water molecules from flying off into space. For example, Mars is smaller than Earth, and so has less gravity, and that's one important reason that Mars has a very thin atmosphere, and no oceans at its surface. Second, the planet needs to have an atmosphere. Why? Because without an atmosphere, the planet is in a vacuum, and liquid water isn't stable in a vacuum. For example, our moon has no atmosphere, and so if you spill some water on the moon, it will either boil away as vapor, or freeze solid to make ice. Without the pressure of an atmosphere, liquid water can't survive. Third, the planet needs to be at the right distance from its star. Too close, and the surface temperature will exceed the boiling point of water, and oceans will turn to vapor. Too far, and the surface temperature will fall below the freezing point of water, causing the oceans to turn to ice. Fire or ice. For life as we know it, neither will suffice. You can imagine that the perfect zone where water stays liquid looks kind of like a belt around a star. We call that belt the habitable zone. So when we search for habitable worlds, we definitely want to look for planets in the habitable zones around their stars. Those regions are the best bets to find planets like Earth. But while habitable zones are a pretty good place to begin the search for planets with life, there are a couple of complications. First, a planet isn't necessarily habitable just because it's in the habitable zone. Consider the planet Venus in our solar system. If you were an alien astronomer, you'd think Venus is a pretty good bet for life. It's the right size, it has an atmosphere, and it's in the habitable zone of our sun. An alien astronomer might see it as Earth's twin. But Venus is not habitable, at least not at its surface. Not by life as we know it. It's too hot. That's because Venus' atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide, an important greenhouse gas. In fact, its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide, and is almost 100 times thicker than our own. As a result, the temperature on Venus is hot enough to melt lead, and the planet is dry as a bone. So finding planets of the right size and distance from their stars is only a beginning. We also want to know about the makeup of their atmospheres. The second complication emerges when we look a little more deeply at planet Earth. In the last 30 years, we've discovered microbes living in all sorts of extreme environments. We find them in fissures of rock miles beneath our feet, in boiling waters of the ocean floor, in acidic waters of thermal springs, and in cloud droplets miles above our heads. These so-called extremophiles aren't rare. Some scientists estimate that the mass of microbes living deep underground equals the mass of all the life at Earth's surface. These subterranean microbes don't need oceans or sunshine. These discoveries suggest that Earth-like planets may be only the tip of the astrobiological iceberg. It's possible that life might persist in aquifers beneath the surface of Mars. Microbes may thrive on Jupiter's moon Europa, where liquid water ocean probably lies beneath the icy crust. Another ocean beneath the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus is the source of geysers erupting into space. Could these geysers be raining microbes? Could we fly through them to find out? And what about life as we don't know it, using a liquid other than water? Maybe we are the crazy creatures living in an unusual and extreme environment. Maybe the real habitable zone is so large that there are billions of needles in those trillions of haystacks. Maybe in the big scheme of things, Earth is only one of many different kinds of habitable worlds. The only way to find out is to go out and explore.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The universe contains about 100 billion galaxies. Each of those galaxies contains about 100 billion stars. Many of those stars have planets orbiting them. So how do we look for life in all that immensity? It's like searching for a needle in trillions of haystacks. We might want to focus our search on planets that we know can support life as we know it -- what we call habitable worlds. What do such planets look like? To answer that question, we don't look out there. Instead, we look at ourselves. At Earth. Because this is the one planet in the universe that we know for certain is habitable. When we look at Earth from space, we see a blue, watery world. It's no coincidence that three quarters of the surface is covered by oceans. Because of its unique chemical and physical properties, water is absolutely essential for all life as we know it. And so we get especially excited about other worlds on which water is abundant. Fortunately, water is very common in the universe. But life needs water in the form of liquid, not ice, and not vapor, and that's a little bit less common. For a planet to have liquid water at its surface, three things are important. First, the planet needs to be large enough that the force of gravity keeps the water molecules from flying off into space. For example, Mars is smaller than Earth, and so has less gravity, and that's one important reason that Mars has a very thin atmosphere, and no oceans at its surface. Second, the planet needs to have an atmosphere. Why? Because without an atmosphere, the planet is in a vacuum, and liquid water isn't stable in a vacuum. For example, our moon has no atmosphere, and so if you spill some water on the moon, it will either boil away as vapor, or freeze solid to make ice. Without the pressure of an atmosphere, liquid water can't survive. Third, the planet needs to be at the right distance from its star. Too close, and the surface temperature will exceed the boiling point of water, and oceans will turn to vapor. Too far, and the surface temperature will fall below the freezing point of water, causing the oceans to turn to ice. Fire or ice. For life as we know it, neither will suffice. You can imagine that the perfect zone where water stays liquid looks kind of like a belt around a star. We call that belt the habitable zone. So when we search for habitable worlds, we definitely want to look for planets in the habitable zones around their stars. Those regions are the best bets to find planets like Earth. But while habitable zones are a pretty good place to begin the search for planets with life, there are a couple of complications.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar (Stories from the Sea: How Life Came to Land) Life for my kind wasn't always this way. There was a time when no animals lived on land. All life was in the ocean. The ocean's where all of us animals got our start, more than half a billion years ago, This is where all animal body types -- or phyla, as scientists call them -- first evolved. You know, there are more than 30 animal phyla, but only a handful of major ones had what it took to do something completely daring: step out of the ocean, and on to dry land. So, which of these land-dwelling phyla first invaded the land? Was it me and my mollusc friends, with our amazing mantles and single foot? Perhaps the chordate crowd, with their notochords, segmented muscles and big bony skeletons. Or maybe those lowly annelid worms, with their powerful ringed bodies. Or did the Arthropods first make landfall, with their little flexible suits of armor -- their exoskeleton? Ah, yes. The arthropods. From crustaceans to millipedes, spiders to insects, the arthropods outnumber all animals on land. So what's their secret? Their exoskeleton is key, but here's the real kicker: jointed appendages. They're like little living Swiss army knives: antennae, multiple mouth parts, an obscene number of legs, if you ask me. There's one group of arthropods -- the insects -- that really rule the land. Three body parts, six legs, and an annoying tendency to take over. Sure, they have to molt to grow, but that doesn't seem to pose a problem. The insects even invented the first wings, and conquered the skies. Ah, well. So what if arthropods were the first to reach land and invent flight, a hundred million years before the rest of us? So what if they pollinate crops around the world, and make up 75% of all land animal species? And that for every single human, there's 200 million of them? Sure, those leggy arthropods may still be in the lead when it comes to conquering land, but we still rule in the sea. There are more species of molluscs in the ocean than any other animal phylum. We're just getting started up here on land. Besides, the seas are rising. Just give us some time. Who knows who'll end up ruling this ocean planet?

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Lawn signs sprouting everywhere. Round-the-clock ads on radio and television. The phone rings. It's a robo-call from the president, or his opponent, asking for your money, and your vote. And while you're at it, watch their YouTube videos and like them on Facebook. Election time. We all know the look and feel of modern campaigns. But what was it like in the early days of the Republic, when, say, George Washington ran for office? Well, in fact, he didn't run. When Washington became the first president in 1789, there were no political parties, no conventions or primaries, no campaign, no election season. Not really any candidates. Even the year was odd. Literally. 1789 was the only presidential election ever held in an odd year. After the framers invented the constitution and the presidency 225 years ago, the country set about the business of choosing its first executive. Agreeing with Ben Franklin, many people thought "The first man at the helm will be a good one," and by that, Franklin meant George Washington. Greatest hero of the Revolution, Washington presided over the convention that created the constitution, rarely speaking. He never discussed the job of president, or of wanting it. And when the first presidential election took place, it was a crazy-quilt affair, with many hands stitching the pattern. Under the new constitution, each state was given a number of electors. who would cast a vote for two names. The man with the most votes would be president, the second-place finisher was vice president. Ah, but who picked the electors? That was left up to the states. Six of them let the people decide, or at least white men over 21 who owned property. In New Jersey, some women voted, a right later taken away. But in other states, the legislature picked the electors. At that time, many people thought democracy was one step away from mob rule and a decision this important should be left to wiser men. These electors then voted for president. All the states had to do was get their votes in on time. But there were glitches. Only 10 of the 13 states voted. Rhode Island and North Carolina hadn't ratified the constitution and couldn't vote. New York missed the deadline for naming its electors, and also was not counted. When the votes were tallied, it was unanimous. George Washington won easily. John Adams trailed far behind, finishing second, and became the vice president. Told of his victory, George Washington was not surprised. At Mount Vernon, his bags were already packed. He moved to New York City, the nation's temporary capital, and he would have to figure out just what a president was supposed to do. Since that first election, American democracy and elections have come a long way. The constitution has been changed to open up voting to more people: black men, women, Native Americans, and eighteen-year-olds included. Getting that basic right extended to all those people has been a long, hard struggle. So when you think you can't stand any more of those lawn signs, and TV ads, just remember: the right to vote wasn't always for everyone, and that's a piece of history worth knowing.

After the framers invented the constitution and the presidency 225 years ago, the country set about the business of choosing its first executive. Agreeing with Ben Franklin, many people thought "The first man at the helm will be a good one," and by that, Franklin meant George Washington. Greatest hero of the Revolution, Washington presided over the convention that created the constitution, rarely speaking. He never discussed the job of president, or of wanting it. And when the first presidential election took place, it was a crazy-quilt affair, with many hands stitching the pattern. Under the new constitution, each state was given a number of electors. who would cast a vote for two names. The man with the most votes would be president, the second-place finisher was vice president. Ah, but who picked the electors? That was left up to the states. Six of them let the people decide, or at least white men over 21 who owned property. In New Jersey, some women voted, a right later taken away. But in other states, the legislature picked the electors. At that time, many people thought democracy was one step away from mob rule and a decision this important should be left to wiser men. These electors then voted for president. All the states had to do was get their votes in on time. But there were glitches. Only 10 of the 13 states voted. Rhode Island and North Carolina hadn't ratified the constitution and couldn't vote. New York missed the deadline for naming its electors, and also was not counted. When the votes were tallied, it was unanimous. George Washington won easily. John Adams trailed far behind, finishing second, and became the vice president. Told of his victory, George Washington was not surprised. At Mount Vernon, his bags were already packed. He moved to New York City, the nation's temporary capital, and he would have to figure out just what a president was supposed to do. Since that first election, American democracy and elections have come a long way. The constitution has been changed to open up voting to more people: black men, women, Native Americans, and eighteen-year-olds included. Getting that basic right extended to all those people has been a long, hard struggle. So when you think you can't stand any more of those lawn signs, and TV ads, just remember: the right to vote wasn't always for everyone, and that's a piece of history worth knowing.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Most people have heard of the Electoral College during presidential election years. But what exactly is the Electoral College? Simply said, it is a group of people appointed by each state who formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States. To understand how this process began and how it continues today, we can look at the Constitution of the United States: article two, section one, clause two of the constitution. It specifies how many electors each state is entitled to have. Since 1964, there have been 538 electors in each presidential election. How do they decide on the number 538? Well, the number of electors is equal to the total voting membership of the United States Congress. 435 representatives, plus 100 senators, and 3 electors from the District of Columbia. Essentially, the Democratic candidate and Republican candidate are each trying to add up the electors in every state so that they surpass 270 electoral votes, or just over half the 538 votes, and win the presidency. So how do states even get electoral votes? Each state receives a particular number of electors based on population size. The census is conducted every 10 years, so every time the census happens, states might gain or lose a few electoral votes. Let's say you're a voter in California, a state with 55 electoral votes. If your candidate wins in California, they get all 55 of the state's electoral votes. If your candidate loses, they get none. This is why many presidential candidates want to win states like Texas, Florida, and New York. If you currently add up the electoral votes of those three states, you would have 96 electoral votes. Even if a candidate won North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire. Connecticut and West Virginia, they would only gain 31 electoral votes total from those eight states. Here is where it can get a little tricky. On a rare occasion, like in the year 2000, someone can win the popular vote but fail to gain 270 electoral votes. This means that the winner may have won and collected their electoral votes by small margins, winning just enough states with just enough electoral votes, but the losing candidate may have captured large voter margins in the remaining states. If this is the case, the very large margins secured by the losing candidate in the other states would add up to over 50% of the ballots cast nationally. Therefore, the losing candidate may have gained more than 50% of the ballots cast by voters, but failed to gain 270 of the electoral votes. Some critics of the electoral college argue the system gives an unfair advantage to states with large numbers of electoral votes. Think of it this way. It is possible for a candidate to not get a single person's vote -- not one vote -- in 39 states, or the District of Columbia, yet be elected president by winning the popular vote in just 11 of these 12 states: California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia or Virginia. This is why both parties pay attention to these states. However, others argue that the electoral college protects small states such as Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire, and even geographically large states with small populations like Alaska, Wyoming and the Dakotas. That's because a candidate can't completely ignore small states, because in a close election, every electoral vote counts. There are certain states that have a long history of voting for a particular party. These are known as "safe states." For the past four election cycles -- in 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 -- Democrats could count on states like Oregon, Maryland, Michigan and Massachusetts, whereas the Republicans could count on states like Mississippi, Alabama, Kansas and Idaho. States that are teetering between between parties are called "swing states." In the past four election cycles, Ohio and Florida have been swing states, twice providing electoral votes for a Democratic candidate, and twice providing electoral votes for a Republican candidate. Think about it. Do you live in a safe state? If so, is it a Democratic or Republican safe state? Do you live in a swing state? Are your neighboring states swing or safe? Is the population in your state increasing or decreasing? And do not forget, when you are watching the electoral returns on election night every four years and the big map of the United States is on the screen, know that the magic number is 270 and start adding.

Transcriber: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Take an adjective such as "implacable," or a verb like "proliferate," or even another noun, "crony," and add a suffix, such as "-ity," or "-tion," or "-ism." You've created a new noun. "Implacability," "proliferation," "cronyism." Sounds impressive, right? Wrong! You've just unleashed a flesh-eating zombie. Nouns made from other parts of speech are called nominalizations. Academics love them. So do lawyers, bureaucrats, business writers. I call them zombie nouns, because they consume the living. They cannibalize active verbs, they suck the lifeblood from adjectives, and they substitute abstract entities for human beings. Here's an example. "The proliferation of nominalizations in a discursive formation may be an indication of a tendency towards pomposity and abstraction." Huh? This sentence contains no fewer than seven nominalizations, yet it fails to tell us who is doing what. When we eliminate, or reanimate, most of the zombie nouns, so "tendency" becomes "tend," "abstraction" becomes "abstract," then we add a human subject and some active verbs, the sentence springs back to life. "Writers who overload their sentences with nominalizations tend to sound pompous and abstract." Only one zombie noun -- the key word "nominalizations" -- has been allowed to remain standing. At their best, nominalizations help us express complex ideas, perception, intelligence, epistemology. At their worst, they impede clear communication. To get a feeling for how zombie nouns work, release a few of them into a lively sentence and watch them sap all its energy. George Orwell played this game in his essay "Politics in the English Language." He started with a well-known verse from the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible. It says "I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all." Now here's Orwell's modern English version. "Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account." The Bible passage speaks to our senses and emotions with concrete nouns, descriptions of people, and punchy, abstract nouns such as "race," "battle," "riches," "time," "chance." Not a zombie among them. Orwell's satirical translation, on the other hand, is teeming with nominalizations and other vague abstractions. The zombies have taken over, and the humans have fled the village. Zombie nouns do their worst damage when they gather in jargon-generating packs and swallow every noun, verb and adjective in sight. So "globe" becomes "global," becomes "globalize," becomes "globalization." The grandfather of all nominalizations, antidisestablishmentarianism, contains at least two verbs, three adjectives, and six other nouns inside its distended belly.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

Transcriber: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Take an adjective such as "implacable," or a verb like "proliferate," or even another noun, "crony," and add a suffix, such as "-ity," or "-tion," or "-ism." You've created a new noun. "Implacability," "proliferation," "cronyism." Sounds impressive, right? Wrong! You've just unleashed a flesh-eating zombie. Nouns made from other parts of speech are called nominalizations. Academics love them. So do lawyers, bureaucrats, business writers. I call them zombie nouns, because they consume the living. They cannibalize active verbs, they suck the lifeblood from adjectives, and they substitute abstract entities for human beings. Here's an example. "The proliferation of nominalizations in a discursive formation may be an indication of a tendency towards pomposity and abstraction." Huh? This sentence contains no fewer than seven nominalizations, yet it fails to tell us who is doing what. When we eliminate, or reanimate, most of the zombie nouns, so "tendency" becomes "tend," "abstraction" becomes "abstract," then we add a human subject and some active verbs, the sentence springs back to life. "Writers who overload their sentences with nominalizations tend to sound pompous and abstract." Only one zombie noun -- the key word "nominalizations" -- has been allowed to remain standing. At their best, nominalizations help us express complex ideas, perception, intelligence, epistemology. At their worst, they impede clear communication. To get a feeling for how zombie nouns work, release a few of them into a lively sentence and watch them sap all its energy. George Orwell played this game in his essay "Politics in the English Language." He started with a well-known verse from the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible. It says "I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all." Now here's Orwell's modern English version. "Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account." The Bible passage speaks to our senses and emotions with concrete nouns, descriptions of people, and punchy, abstract nouns such as "race," "battle," "riches," "time," "chance." Not a zombie among them. Orwell's satirical translation, on the other hand, is teeming with nominalizations and other vague abstractions. The zombies have taken over, and the humans have fled the village. Zombie nouns do their worst damage when they gather in jargon-generating packs and swallow every noun, verb and adjective in sight. So "globe" becomes "global," becomes "globalize," becomes "globalization." The grandfather of all nominalizations, antidisestablishmentarianism, contains at least two verbs, three adjectives, and six other nouns inside its distended belly. A paragraph heavily populated by nominalizations will send your readers straight to sleep. Rescue them from the zombie apocalypse with vigorous verb-driven sentences that are concrete and clearly structured. You want your sentences to live, not to join the living dead.

Transcriber: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The first 10 amendments
to the U.S. Constitution -- also known as the Bill of Rights -- were ratified or passed
over 200 years ago. But even though they're a bit, well, old, these first 10 amendments are still
the most debated and discussed section of our Constitution today. So, can you remember what they are? Let's take a look. The First Amendment
is the freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly and petition. This may be the most revered
of the amendments. The First Amendment protects our rights
to say and write our opinions, worship how we please,
assemble together peacefully and petition our government,
if we feel the need. The Second Amendment
is the right to bear arms. The original intent
of the Second Amendment was to protect colonists
from the invading British soldiers, but it now guarantees
that you have the right to own a gun to defend
yourself and your property. The Third Amendment is called
the "Quartering" amendment. It was written in response
to the British occupation, and as a result of the colonists
having to house -- or quarter -- soldiers in their homes
during the American Revolution. Because of this amendment, our government can never force us
to house soldiers in our home. The Fourth Amendment
is the right to search and seizure. The police can't come into our home
without a search warrant and take our personal property. Today, many concerns have arisen
about our rights to privacy in technology. For example, can the government track
your location with your smartphone, or can social media postings
such as on Facebook and Twitter be used without a warrant? On to the Fifth:
It's all about due process. You've probably heard the phrase
"I plead the Fifth" in movies or on TV. They're talking about the Fifth Amendment, which says that you don't have to take
the witness stand against yourself if you may end up incriminating yourself. OK, we're halfway done. The Sixth and Seventh Amendments
are about how the legal system works. If you're accused of a crime, you have the right to a speedy
public trial and an impartial jury. You also have the right to a lawyer, and the right to take
the stand if you choose. This is important because it will prevent
the accused from sitting in prison forever and insists that the prosecution
proceed with undue delay. The Seventh says you have
the right to a jury trial, where 12 impartial peers decide
your innocence or guilt in the courtroom, as opposed to a judge doing it all alone. The Eight Amendment prohibits
cruel and unusual punishment. Is the death penalty cruel? Is it unusual? It's hard for Americans to agree
on the definitions of cruel and unusual. The Ninth and Tenth Amendments
are called the non-rights amendments. They say that the rights
not listed in the Bill of Rights are retained by the people in the states. We have other rights
that are not listed in the Constitution, and the states have the right
to make their own policies, like instituting state taxes. So now you know all 10 amendments. Can you remember them all? If not, remember this: the Bill of Rights is a crucial piece
of American history, and though society
has undergone many changes these past 200 and some years, the interpretation and application
of these amendments are as vital today as they were when they were written.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar It's March the 17th in A.D. 73. We're visiting ancient Rome
to watch the Liberalia, an annual festival that celebrates
the liberty of Rome's citizens. We're looking in at a 17-year-old
named Lucius Popidius Secundus. He's not from a poor family, but he lives
in the region known as the Subura, a poorer neighborhood in Rome,
yet close to the center of the city. (Gong) The tenants of these
apartments are crammed in, (Grunting) which poses considerable risk. Fires are frequent and the smell of ash
and smoke in the morning is not uncommon. Lucius, who awoke at dawn,
has family duties to perform today. (Cheering) His 15-year-old brother is coming of age. Half the children in ancient Rome
die before they reach adulthood, so this is a particularly
important milestone. Lucius watches his brother
stand in his new toga before the household shrine
with its protective deities, as he places his bulla,
a protective amulet, in the shrine with a prayer of thanks. The bulla had worked.
It had protected him. Unlike many others,
he had survived to become an adult. At 17, Lucius has almost
completed his education. He has learned to speak well,
make public speeches, and how to read and write
both Latin and Greek. His father has taught him
the types of things you can't learn in the classroom: how to run, how to swim, and how to fight. Lucius could choose, at 17,
to become a military tribune and command soldiers
on the edge of the Empire. But in other ways,
Lucius is still a child. He's not trusted
to arrange business deals. His father will take care
of that until he is 25. And Dad will arrange Lucius' marriage
to a girl 10 years younger. His dad has his eye on a family
with a 7-year-old daughter. Back to the Liberalia. As Lucius leaves with his family, the shops are open as the population
goes about its business. The streets are full
of itinerant traders selling trinkets and people bustling from place to place. Large wagons are not allowed
in the city until after the ninth hour but the streets are still crowded. Fathers and uncles
take the kids to the Forum Augustus to see statues of Rome's famous warriors like Aeneas, who led Rome's ancestors,
the Trojans, to Italy. And Romulus, Rome's founder. And all the great generals of the Republic
from more than 100 years earlier. Lovingly, we can imagine
fathers and guardians with their now adult children remembering stories of Rome's glory and re-telling the good deeds and sayings
of the great men of the past: lessons on how to live well, and to overcome the follies of youth. There is a sense of history in this place,
relevant to their present. Romans made an empire
without end in time and space. (Thump) Rome was destined to be
eternal through warfare. Wars were a fact of life, even in A.D. 73. There are campaigns in the north
of England and into Scotland, to the north of the River
Danube into Romania, and on the frontier
between Syria and Iraq to the east. It's now the eighth hour --
time to head for the baths. Lucius and his family head up
the Via Lata, the wide street, to the Campus Martius,
and the enormous Baths of Agrippa. The family members leave
the clients and freedmen outside, and enter the baths with their peer group. Baths would change from dark,
steamy rooms to light ones. The Romans had perfected window glass. Everyone moves from the cold room to the tepid room and to the very hot room. (Man) Oops! More than an hour later, the bathers leave massaged, oiled, (Whistling) and have been scraped down with a strigil to remove the remaining dirt. At the ninth hour, seven hours
after they left home, the men return for a celebratory dinner. Dinner is an intimate affair, with nine people
reclining around the low table. Slaves attend to their every need if the diners, through gestures,
demand more food and wine. As the day closes, we can hear
the rumble of wagons outside. The clients and freedmen, with a meal of robust
-- if inferior -- food inside them, shuffle off to the now tepid baths before returning
to their apartment blocks. Back at Lucius' house,
the drinking continues into the night. Lucius and his stepbrother
don't look too well. A slave stands by in case
either of them needs to vomit. With hindsight, we know Lucius' future. In 20 years' time, the Emperor Vespasian's
youngest son, Domitian, as emperor, will enact a reign of terror. Will Lucius survive? (Drums)

apartments are crammed in, (Grunting) which poses considerable risk. Fires are frequent and the smell of ash
and smoke in the morning is not uncommon. Lucius, who awoke at dawn,
has family duties to perform today. (Cheering) His 15-year-old brother is coming of age. Half the children in ancient Rome
die before they reach adulthood, so this is a particularly
important milestone. Lucius watches his brother
stand in his new toga before the household shrine
with its protective deities, as he places his bulla,
a protective amulet, in the shrine with a prayer of thanks. The bulla had worked.
It had protected him. Unlike many others,
he had survived to become an adult. At 17, Lucius has almost
completed his education. He has learned to speak well,
make public speeches, and how to read and write
both Latin and Greek. His father has taught him
the types of things you can't learn in the classroom: how to run, how to swim, and how to fight. Lucius could choose, at 17,
to become a military tribune and command soldiers
on the edge of the Empire. But in other ways,
Lucius is still a child. He's not trusted
to arrange business deals. His father will take care
of that until he is 25. And Dad will arrange Lucius' marriage
to a girl 10 years younger. His dad has his eye on a family
with a 7-year-old daughter. Back to the Liberalia. As Lucius leaves with his family, the shops are open as the population
goes about its business. The streets are full
of itinerant traders selling trinkets and people bustling from place to place. Large wagons are not allowed
in the city until after the ninth hour but the streets are still crowded. Fathers and uncles
take the kids to the Forum Augustus to see statues of Rome's famous warriors like Aeneas, who led Rome's ancestors,
the Trojans, to Italy. And Romulus, Rome's founder. And all the great generals of the Republic
from more than 100 years earlier. Lovingly, we can imagine
fathers and guardians with their now adult children remembering stories of Rome's glory and re-telling the good deeds and sayings
of the great men of the past: lessons on how to live well, and to overcome the follies of youth. There is a sense of history in this place,
relevant to their present. Romans made an empire
without end in time and space. (Thump) Rome was destined to be
eternal through warfare. Wars were a fact of life, even in A.D. 73. There are campaigns in the north
of England and into Scotland, to the north of the River
Danube into Romania, and on the frontier
between Syria and Iraq to the east. It's now the eighth hour --
time to head for the baths. Lucius and his family head up
the Via Lata, the wide street, to the Campus Martius,
and the enormous Baths of Agrippa. The family members leave
the clients and freedmen outside, and enter the baths with their peer group. Baths would change from dark,
steamy rooms to light ones. The Romans had perfected window glass. Everyone moves from the cold room to the tepid room and to the very hot room. (Man) Oops! More than an hour later, the bathers leave massaged, oiled, (Whistling) and have been scraped down with a strigil to remove the remaining dirt. At the ninth hour, seven hours
after they left home, the men return for a celebratory dinner. Dinner is an intimate affair, with nine people
reclining around the low table. Slaves attend to their every need if the diners, through gestures,
demand more food and wine. As the day closes, we can hear
the rumble of wagons outside. The clients and freedmen, with a meal of robust
-- if inferior -- food inside them, shuffle off to the now tepid baths before returning
to their apartment blocks. Back at Lucius' house,
the drinking continues into the night. Lucius and his stepbrother
don't look too well. A slave stands by in case
either of them needs to vomit. With hindsight, we know Lucius' future. In 20 years' time, the Emperor Vespasian's
youngest son, Domitian, as emperor, will enact a reign of terror. Will Lucius survive? (Drums)

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Most people have heard the word "gerrymandering" once or twice, probably during a presidential election. What exactly is gerrymandering? Essentially, it's the process of giving one political party an advantage over another political party by redrawing district lines. It's like Democrats trying to gain an advantage over Republicans, or Republicans trying to gain an advantage over Democrats. You see, each party wants to gain as many districts as possible so they can do things like control the state budget, or set themselves up to win even more districts in the future. So to understand how this process began, and how it continues today, we must go back to 1812 in Massachusetts.  Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts, supported and signed a bill to allow redistricting. That is, redrawing the boundaries that separate districts. The catch? The new lines would favor Gerry's own political party, the Democratic-Republican party, which no longer exists. You see, Gerry wanted his party to win as many state Senate seats as possible. The more members of your party who vote, the more likely you are to win an election. The new lines were drawn to include loads of areas that would help Governor Gerry in the future. They were so strange looking that someone said the new districts looked like a salamander. The Boston Gazette added Gerry's name to the word salamander, and voilà! Gerrymandering, the process of dividing up and redrawing districts to give your political party an advantage. So how exactly does someone go about protecting their own political party, and actually gerrymandering a district? There are two successful practices. Packing a district, and cracking a district. Packing is the process of drawing district lines and packing in your opponents like cattle, into as few districts as possible. If more districts equals more votes, the fewer the districts there are, the fewer votes the opposition party will get. Packing, then, decreases the opponent's voter strength and influence. Cracking is the opposite: taking one district and cracking it into several pieces. This is usually done in districts where your opponent has many supporters. Cracking spreads these supporters out among many districts, denying your opponent a lot of votes. When you have a large number of people who would generally vote for one type of party, those folks are known as a voting bloc. Cracking is a way to break that all up. So when would a party choose to pack their opponent's districts rather than crack them? Well, that really depends on what the party needs. To dilute your opponent's voters, you could pack them into one district and leave the surrounding districts filled with voters of your own party. Or, if you and your party are in power when it's time to redraw district lines, you could redraw districts and crack up a powerful district and spread your opponent's voters out across several neighboring districts. So, Governor Gerry in 1812 wanted to gain an advantage for his party, and redrew district lines in his state in such a crazy way we have a whole new word and way of thinking about how political parties can gain advantages over their opponents. Politicians think of creative ways to draw districts every few years. So the next time an election comes around, and politicians ask people to vote, be sure to look up the shape of your district and the districts that surround it. How wide does your district stretch across your state? Are all of the districts in your state relatively the same shape? How many other districts does your district touch? But always be sure to ask yourself, does my district look like a salamander?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What exactly is gerrymandering?

The more members of your party who vote, the more likely you are to win an election. The new lines were drawn to include loads of areas that would help Governor Gerry in the future. They were so strange looking that someone said the new districts looked like a salamander. The Boston Gazette added Gerry's name to the word salamander, and voilà! Gerrymandering, the process of dividing up and redrawing districts to give your political party an advantage. So how exactly does someone go about protecting their own political party, and actually gerrymandering a district? There are two successful practices. Packing a district, and cracking a district. Packing is the process of drawing district lines and packing in your opponents like cattle, into as few districts as possible. If more districts equals more votes, the fewer the districts there are, the fewer votes the opposition party will get. Packing, then, decreases the opponent's voter strength and influence. Cracking is the opposite: taking one district and cracking it into several pieces. This is usually done in districts where your opponent has many supporters. Cracking spreads these supporters out among many districts, denying your opponent a lot of votes. When you have a large number of people who would generally vote for one type of party, those folks are known as a voting bloc. Cracking is a way to break that all up. So when would a party choose to pack their opponent's districts rather than crack them? Well, that really depends on what the party needs. To dilute your opponent's voters, you could pack them into one district and leave the surrounding districts filled with voters of your own party. Or, if you and your party are in power when it's time to redraw district lines, you could redraw districts and crack up a powerful district and spread your opponent's voters out across several neighboring districts. So, Governor Gerry in 1812 wanted to gain an advantage for his party, and redrew district lines in his state in such a crazy way we have a whole new word and way of thinking about how political parties can gain advantages over their opponents. Politicians think of creative ways to draw districts every few years. So the next time an election comes around, and politicians ask people to vote, be sure to look up the shape of your district and the districts that surround it. How wide does your district stretch across your state? Are all of the districts in your state relatively the same shape? How many other districts does your district touch? But always be sure to ask yourself, does my district look like a salamander?
