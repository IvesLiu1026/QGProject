**Transcript**:
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the story of Malcolm McLean and the concept of containerization.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match. This question asks about the impact of an idea (containerization) on a larger system (the global marketplace), which is similar to the ground truth MCQ that asks about the interest in the white-footed mouse and its relation to urbanization and evolution.

But again, the content and intent of the questions are quite different, so this is a very rough match.

from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side

of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City

intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread

and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students

the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary

will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure

between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips

**Transcript**:
(Music) Everything is everywhere these days. Check out the supermarket -- orange
juice from China, nuts from India, swordfish from Japan,
lagers from Czechoslovakia, scores of European cheeses. You name it, it's there.
Not when I was growing up. You'd never taste a range
of French cheeses or Bohemian lager beer. At least, you couldn't
unless you were very rich and could go anywhere when the fancy
took you. All that has changed. But it's not just foods. Got an iPhone? Everyone knows it was invented
and designed at Cupertino in California, but who knows where the complex bits and pieces of its
innards are made or assembled? Apple doesn't say. The industry credits China,
Japan, Germany, South Korea and, of course, the United States itself. Just think for a moment
of the trillions of parts and finished goods moving
cheaply around the world every second, a small portion by air, but most by sea. We call it globalization, but the man who basically made
globalization a reality in our lives is too little known. This is his story. The story of the man who makes your day. In the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of Americans were
out of work, worse than now, Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old
truck driver. He got a job to take cotton bales from Fayetteville in North
Carolina all the way to a pier in Hoboken, New
Jersey for shipping overseas. He was glad of the work,
but when he arrived he got bored out of his mind,
sitting in his truck waiting and waiting
and waiting on the docks as the worker ants muscled crates
and bundles off other trucks and into slings that lifted the goods
into the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed
in a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped
in the process he watched. It was called break bulk shipping. Boxes, bales, crates
handled piece by piece. What Malcolm envisaged
would have saved him only a day, but it would have saved everyone else something like two weeks
in loading and unloading the ship. On average, it was eight days to haul and distribute break
bulk shipments in the hold, plus another eight days at the other end to retrieve and distribute. All that time would have been saved if Malcolm McLean could have just
driven his truck onto the ship and at the other end, driven it off. Well, today that concept is a reality. The concept that occurred to Malcolm is known as containerization. It has done more than just
save a great deal of time. It's the reason why we have
a thriving global marketplace, offering us that infinite
variety of things, and it's the reason we can move cargo from remote parts
of the world at minimal cost. Malcolm had his idea in 1937. The 24-year-old truck driver
sitting in his truck in Hoboken was 40 before he did anything about it. By then, he'd built his one truck into a big trucking company.
He borrowed money from an enterprising vice president
at Citibank in New York, and set about designing the steel
boxes and the decks of the ships to carry them stacked
one on top of another. A lot of people thought he was crazy. Inventors always attract
armies of naysayers who can never remember
how critical they were. For our part, we should
remember Malcolm McLean. His first container ship, the Ideal X, sailed from Shed 154 at Marsh Street, Port Newark with 58 well-filled boxes. It was the beginning of the container era, shrinking our world and enlarging human choice.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, focusing on financial aid, education, and social issues, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to globalization and the availability of international products in a grocery store.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but only in terms of having multiple options and a correct answer. The content and intent of Question 3 are still unrelated to the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I must conclude that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ. If I had to provide an index, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about what McLean wanted to ship overseas, while the generated MCQs are unrelated to the topic.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the fact that it is the only one that mentions a specific item, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, not because of the content, but because it is the only one that mentions a specific item (a historical figure), but the question intent and options are not similar.

A more accurate answer would be that there is no similar generated MCQ, and a new question should be generated to match the ground truth MCQ.

If you want, I can help you generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
(Music) Everything is everywhere these days. Check out the supermarket -- orange
juice from China, nuts from India, swordfish from Japan,
lagers from Czechoslovakia, scores of European cheeses. You name it, it's there.
Not when I was growing up. You'd never taste a range
of French cheeses or Bohemian lager beer. At least, you couldn't
unless you were very rich and could go anywhere when the fancy
took you. All that has changed. But it's not just foods. Got an iPhone? Everyone knows it was invented
and designed at Cupertino in California, but who knows where the complex bits and pieces of its
innards are made or assembled? Apple doesn't say. The industry credits China,
Japan, Germany, South Korea and, of course, the United States itself. Just think for a moment
of the trillions of parts and finished goods moving
cheaply around the world every second, a small portion by air, but most by sea. We call it globalization, but the man who basically made
globalization a reality in our lives is too little known. This is his story. The story of the man who makes your day. In the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of Americans were
out of work, worse than now, Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old
truck driver. He got a job to take cotton bales from Fayetteville in North
Carolina all the way to a pier in Hoboken, New
Jersey for shipping overseas. He was glad of the work,
but when he arrived he got bored out of his mind,
sitting in his truck waiting and waiting
and waiting on the docks as the worker ants muscled crates
and bundles off other trucks and into slings that lifted the goods
into the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed
in a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped
in the process he watched. It was called break bulk shipping. Boxes, bales, crates
handled piece by piece. What Malcolm envisaged
would have saved him only a day, but it would have saved everyone else something like two weeks
in loading and unloading the ship. On average, it was eight days to haul and distribute break
bulk shipments in the hold, plus another eight days at the other end to retrieve and distribute. All that time would have been saved if Malcolm McLean could have just
driven his truck onto the ship and at the other end, driven it off. Well, today that concept is a reality. The concept that occurred to Malcolm is known as containerization. It has done more than just
save a great deal of time. It's the reason why we have
a thriving global marketplace, offering us that infinite
variety of things, and it's the reason we can move cargo from remote parts
of the world at minimal cost. Malcolm had his idea in 1937. The 24-year-old truck driver
sitting in his truck in Hoboken was 40 before he did anything about it. By then, he'd built his one truck into a big trucking company.
He borrowed money from an enterprising vice president
at Citibank in New York, and set about designing the steel
boxes and the decks of the ships to carry them stacked
one on top of another. A lot of people thought he was crazy. Inventors always attract
armies of naysayers who can never remember
how critical they were. For our part, we should
remember Malcolm McLean. His first container ship, the Ideal X, sailed from Shed 154 at Marsh Street, Port Newark with 58 well-filled boxes. It was the beginning of the container era, shrinking our world and enlarging human choice.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as financial aid and education, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about containerization.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match. But please note that the content and intent of Question 5 are still very different from the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5 (although it's not a good match)

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically designed to match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the identity of Malcolm McLean, and the correct option is "An American trucker-turned inventor." Among the generated MCQs, none of them ask about Malcolm McLean specifically. However, some generated MCQs ask about the speaker's identity or profession, which is not relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

Since there is no direct match, I will not provide an index of a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. Instead, I suggest creating a new generated MCQ that directly asks about Malcolm McLean's identity or profession, with options that include "An American trucker-turned inventor" as the correct answer.

If you would like, I can help you create a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. Please let me know!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Malcolm McLean's age when he got his big break, which is 40 years old. Among the generated MCQs, none of them ask about McLean's age or his big break. However, I can suggest Question 6, which asks about the speaker's goal for their education, but it's not related to McLean's age.

Since there is no direct match, I will not provide an index of a similar generated MCQ. Instead, I suggest generating new MCQs that are more relevant to the transcript and the ground truth MCQ.

If you would like, I can try to generate new MCQs based on the transcript and the ground truth MCQ, and then identify the most similar one.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about historical references in Lissaint's performance, while the generated MCQs are about writing and language.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of them are similar. But if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 9, because it is the least unrelated to the topic of the transcript, which is about education and social issues, but it is still not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

So, my answer would be: None, but if I really had to pick one, I would say 9, but with the caveat that it's not actually similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must emphasize that it would be more accurate to say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, rather than trying to force a match that doesn't exist.

Therefore, my final answer is: None.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of linguistic analysis or literary device identification.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the term "financial aid" being "ironic" in the context of the transcript. The closest generated MCQ that involves analysis of language or literary devices is Question 9, which asks about the author's opinion on using expensive words in writing. However, this question is not similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content or options.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 9 is the closest, but it's still not a good match. A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically designed to match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 9 (note that this is a weak match and not a strong recommendation)

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
We all know the scene: Dorothy closes her eyes, and repeats the Good Witch's mantra, "No coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile." Only Dorothy doesn't say that. She says five one-syllable words, "There's no place like home." Each a word you probably learned in your first year of speaking, each perfectly concise. It's not that L. Frank Baum didn't have a thesaurus, it's that in most cases $10 words fail. Would Aerosmith have had a hit with "Ambulate This Direction?" Probably not. Would Patrick Henry have ignited a revolution by saying, "Provide me with liberty or bestow upon me fatality?" Unlikely. When it comes to words, bigger isn't always better. Ten-dollar words are rendered worthless if they're not understood. That's not to say every piece of literature should be written at a fourth-grade reading level, but it is important to know your audience. If you're a novelist, your audience is probably expecting 300 pages of vivid descriptors. At the very least, they're expecting you won't use the same 50 words to fill those pages. But most of us don't have the luxury of a captive audience. We're competing against a whole world of distractions and we're fighting for space in an attention span that continues to shrink across generations. So get to the point already. Variety may be the spice of life, but brevity is its bread and butter. So when it comes to $10 words, save your money and buy a Scrabble board.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
We all know the scene: Dorothy closes her eyes, and repeats the Good Witch's mantra, "No coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile." Only Dorothy doesn't say that. She says five one-syllable words, "There's no place like home." Each a word you probably learned in your first year of speaking, each perfectly concise. It's not that L. Frank Baum didn't have a thesaurus, it's that in most cases $10 words fail. Would Aerosmith have had a hit with "Ambulate This Direction?" Probably not. Would Patrick Henry have ignited a revolution by saying, "Provide me with liberty or bestow upon me fatality?" Unlikely. When it comes to words, bigger isn't always better. Ten-dollar words are rendered worthless if they're not understood. That's not to say every piece of literature should be written at a fourth-grade reading level, but it is important to know your audience. If you're a novelist, your audience is probably expecting 300 pages of vivid descriptors. At the very least, they're expecting you won't use the same 50 words to fill those pages. But most of us don't have the luxury of a captive audience. We're competing against a whole world of distractions and we're fighting for space in an attention span that continues to shrink across generations. So get to the point already. Variety may be the spice of life, but brevity is its bread and butter. So when it comes to $10 words, save your money and buy a Scrabble board.

**Transcript**:
Are you familiar with the word symbiosis? It's a fancy term for a partnership
between two different species, such as bees and flowers. In a symbiosis, both species
depend on each other. I want to tell you
about a remarkable symbiosis between a little bird,
the Clark's nutcracker, and a big tree, the whitebark pine. Whitebark grow in the mountains
of Wyoming, Montana and other western states. They have huge canopies
and lots of needles, which provide cover and shelter
for other plants and animals, and whitebark feed the forest. Their cones are packed with protein. Squirrels gnaw the cones
from the upper branches so they fall to the ground, and then race down to bury them
in piles, or middens. But they don't get to keep all of them; grizzlies and black bears
love finding middens. But there's more to a symbiosis
than one species feeding another. In the case of the Clark's nutcracker,
this bird gives back. While gathering its seeds,
it also replants the trees. Here's how it works:
using her powerful beak, the nutcracker picks apart
a cone in a treetop, pulling out the seeds. She can store up to 80 of them
in a pouch in her throat. Then she flies through the forest looking for a place to cache the seeds an inch under the soil
in piles of up to eight seeds. Nutcrackers can gather
up to 90,000 seeds in the autumn, which they return for
in the winter and spring. And these birds are smart. They remember where all those seeds are. They even use landmarks
on the landscape -- trees, stumps, rocks -- to triangulate to caches
buried deep under the snow. What they don't go back and get,
those seeds become whitebark. This symbiosis is
so important to both species that they've changed,
or evolved, to suit each other. Nutcrackers have developed
long, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones, and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards with the cones at the very ends, so they can offer them
to the nutcrackers as they fly by. That's a symbiosis: Two species cooperating to help
each other for the benefit of all.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically cosmology and the multiverse, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about the Clark's Nutcracker and its behavior.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on question structure and format, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose one that is the most similar in terms of the structure of the question (i.e., asking for a specific detail about a specific entity), I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, but only in terms of structure, not in terms of content.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, and it would be best to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of the Clark's Nutcracker and its behavior.

**Transcript**:
Are you familiar with the word symbiosis? It's a fancy term for a partnership
between two different species, such as bees and flowers. In a symbiosis, both species
depend on each other. I want to tell you
about a remarkable symbiosis between a little bird,
the Clark's nutcracker, and a big tree, the whitebark pine. Whitebark grow in the mountains
of Wyoming, Montana and other western states. They have huge canopies
and lots of needles, which provide cover and shelter
for other plants and animals, and whitebark feed the forest. Their cones are packed with protein. Squirrels gnaw the cones
from the upper branches so they fall to the ground, and then race down to bury them
in piles, or middens. But they don't get to keep all of them; grizzlies and black bears
love finding middens. But there's more to a symbiosis
than one species feeding another. In the case of the Clark's nutcracker,
this bird gives back. While gathering its seeds,
it also replants the trees. Here's how it works:
using her powerful beak, the nutcracker picks apart
a cone in a treetop, pulling out the seeds. She can store up to 80 of them
in a pouch in her throat. Then she flies through the forest looking for a place to cache the seeds an inch under the soil
in piles of up to eight seeds. Nutcrackers can gather
up to 90,000 seeds in the autumn, which they return for
in the winter and spring. And these birds are smart. They remember where all those seeds are. They even use landmarks
on the landscape -- trees, stumps, rocks -- to triangulate to caches
buried deep under the snow. What they don't go back and get,
those seeds become whitebark. This symbiosis is
so important to both species that they've changed,
or evolved, to suit each other. Nutcrackers have developed
long, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones, and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards with the cones at the very ends, so they can offer them
to the nutcrackers as they fly by. That's a symbiosis: Two species cooperating to help
each other for the benefit of all.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How do squirrels get the Whitebark Pine seeds?
Options: A. They wait for Clark’s Nutrackers to bury the seeds, then immediately dig them up, B. Through an elaborate trade agreement with the Clark’s Nutracker, C. They gather Whitebark pinecones that have fallen to the ground and store them high up in the trees, so that bears do not take them, D. They swat at the pinecones with their tails until the cones fall to the ground, E. They chew the pinecones off the branches and then gather them on the ground

**Transcript**:
(Music) Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight, I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is. And then I remember that there's an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earths inside it. The sun seems impossibly big, but in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale, white mist 
stretched across the sky. And it gets worse. There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes, so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand, just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand. And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe. Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles. Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars. But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still. I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us. Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies. We can think of them as part of our universe. They make up a single, giant edifice, obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos that make up you and me. However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes, built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws. Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond, but nonetheless, combined they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes. in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination. And the leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made of up to 10 to the 500 universes. That's a one followed by 500 zeroes, a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe had its own universe and all of the atoms in all of those universes each had their own universe, and you repeated that for two more cycles, you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total -- namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth. But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity. Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties. How's your brain doing? But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling. And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams. In another, not so much. There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing: This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen.

But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling. And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams. In another, not so much. There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing: This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen.

(Music) Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight, I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is. And then I remember that there's an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earths inside it. The sun seems impossibly big, but in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale, white mist 
stretched across the sky. And it gets worse. There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes, so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand, just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand. And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe. Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles. Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars. But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still. I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us. Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies. We can think of them as part of our universe. They make up a single, giant edifice, obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos that make up you and me. However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes, built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can tell you that the generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, mostly discussing the history of science, the measurement of the Earth's circumference, and the speed of light.

If I had to choose one that is vaguely related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is the concept of multiple universes, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match.

However, I can suggest that the closest match in terms of the complexity and the mathematical nature of the question would be Question 3: **Application**, but this is a very weak match as the topic is completely different.

Therefore, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ for the given ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
(Music) Everything is everywhere these days. Check out the supermarket -- orange
juice from China, nuts from India, swordfish from Japan,
lagers from Czechoslovakia, scores of European cheeses. You name it, it's there.
Not when I was growing up. You'd never taste a range
of French cheeses or Bohemian lager beer. At least, you couldn't
unless you were very rich and could go anywhere when the fancy
took you. All that has changed. But it's not just foods. Got an iPhone? Everyone knows it was invented
and designed at Cupertino in California, but who knows where the complex bits and pieces of its
innards are made or assembled? Apple doesn't say. The industry credits China,
Japan, Germany, South Korea and, of course, the United States itself. Just think for a moment
of the trillions of parts and finished goods moving
cheaply around the world every second, a small portion by air, but most by sea. We call it globalization, but the man who basically made
globalization a reality in our lives is too little known. This is his story. The story of the man who makes your day. In the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of Americans were
out of work, worse than now, Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old
truck driver. He got a job to take cotton bales from Fayetteville in North
Carolina all the way to a pier in Hoboken, New
Jersey for shipping overseas. He was glad of the work,
but when he arrived he got bored out of his mind,
sitting in his truck waiting and waiting
and waiting on the docks as the worker ants muscled crates
and bundles off other trucks and into slings that lifted the goods
into the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed
in a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting
back to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,
inspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.
Yes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped
in the process he watched. It was called break bulk shipping. Boxes, bales, crates
handled piece by piece. What Malcolm envisaged
would have saved him only a day, but it would have saved everyone else something like two weeks
in loading and unloading the ship. On average, it was eight days to haul and distribute break
bulk shipments in the hold, plus another eight days at the other end to retrieve and distribute. All that time would have been saved if Malcolm McLean could have just
driven his truck onto the ship and at the other end, driven it off. Well, today that concept is a reality. The concept that occurred to Malcolm is known as containerization. It has done more than just
save a great deal of time. It's the reason why we have
a thriving global marketplace, offering us that infinite
variety of things, and it's the reason we can move cargo from remote parts
of the world at minimal cost. Malcolm had his idea in 1937. The 24-year-old truck driver
sitting in his truck in Hoboken was 40 before he did anything about it. By then, he'd built his one truck into a big trucking company.
He borrowed money from an enterprising vice president
at Citibank in New York, and set about designing the steel
boxes and the decks of the ships to carry them stacked
one on top of another. A lot of people thought he was crazy. Inventors always attract
armies of naysayers who can never remember
how critical they were. For our part, we should
remember Malcolm McLean. His first container ship, the Ideal X, sailed from Shed 154 at Marsh Street, Port Newark with 58 well-filled boxes. It was the beginning of the container era, shrinking our world and enlarging human choice.

You over there, go put the Pell Grants in the bag. Put the Pell Grants in there too. Yeah, you. Go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You, go over to that booth and get me some of them subsidized, some of them subsidized loans. It ain't a game no more. I know you're hiding the money somewhere here. With all this tuition you got me and my homies payin' -- Woo! -- I'm about to get gangster-scholar up in here. Up in here. I'm about to go N.W.A. meets Beastie Boys if I don't see the cash, man. Cause we're not gonna take it. ♪ Oh ... Oh, you thought I was playing. Oh, you thought this was a game. Back up, back up. Mind your business, that's all. What do you, think this is a game? What? Huh? You don't even know me. I'll say something else. Don't call me crazy. Do not call me -- Rives, tell 'em don't call me crazy before I go crazy. I'm telling you, now I'm about to go crazy. I'm about to go Tupac Thug Life in here. Like, "I ain't a killer but don't push me. Revenge is like the sweetest joy --" Woo! I'm about to go Biggie Smalls Brooklyn type, like, "Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis. When I was dead broke --" Woo! I'm about to go KRS-One cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs-type wild. Like, "Wa da da dang, wa da da da dang, listen to my nine millimeter go bang." You know what? You are dumb. You are really dumb. Hide your kids, hide your wife, 'cause we gettin' financial aid all up and in and around here. You think this is a game? You think I want to be out here doing this? Do you know how hard it was to find these guns? All right, I'm sorry. You understand? I'm just trying to get my education. You know what I mean? I'm just trying to fight for the opportunity that my great-great-great-grandfather died for, you know what I'm saying? You know how my ancestors did sit-ins, just so I can sit in a classroom. And all these years, all y'all been doing is strangling the life out of my bank statement, leaving my pockets as vacant as parking lots. Professor Willie Lynch taught you well, huh? Keep the body, take the money. Force feed my people deception and failure. Condition our brains to malfunction at the sight of success. Just keep the cycle going. Make us pay for an education that will end up failing us. Put us in debt so we're giving back the money we earned from our back-breaking work. This seems all too familiar. Sounds like the rust of shackles locking their way onto my degree. Sounds like the Thirteenth Amendment in reverse. Lecture halls shouldn't feel like cotton fields, shouldn't sound like muffled freedom songs trapped in the jaws of a generation's dreams. Oho! Oh, it all makes sense. Give us enough to get by but not enough to provide for ourselves. Keep us psychologically feeble so we lose our purpose in the process. Stop thieving our aspirations out of our sleep. Don't call it financial aid if you're not helping anyone with it. We have fought. We have fought way too hard to let green paper build a barricade in front of our futures. I will not let you potentially rob food out of my children's stomach. Best believe I'm going out blasting. I ain't no killer, but don't push me. I wish it didn't come to this, but I have to for my cousins in Haiti who don't even know what a college looks like, for my best friend Raymond sitting in cell block nine instead of a university, for the nooses hanging my GPA by its neck. There is no other option. There is no other way. Just, please, put the money in the bag. Put the money in the bag. I just want to go to school, man. I just want to get my education. I just want to learn. I just want to grow. Put the money in the bag, please. Just put the money in the bag.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We all know the scene: Dorothy closes her eyes, and repeats the Good Witch's mantra, "No coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile." Only Dorothy doesn't say that. She says five one-syllable words, "There's no place like home." Each a word you probably learned in your first year of speaking, each perfectly concise. It's not that L. Frank Baum didn't have a thesaurus, it's that in most cases $10 words fail. Would Aerosmith have had a hit with "Ambulate This Direction?" Probably not. Would Patrick Henry have ignited a revolution by saying, "Provide me with liberty or bestow upon me fatality?" Unlikely. When it comes to words, bigger isn't always better. Ten-dollar words are rendered worthless if they're not understood. That's not to say every piece of literature should be written at a fourth-grade reading level, but it is important to know your audience. If you're a novelist, your audience is probably expecting 300 pages of vivid descriptors. At the very least, they're expecting you won't use the same 50 words to fill those pages. But most of us don't have the luxury of a captive audience. We're competing against a whole world of distractions and we're fighting for space in an attention span that continues to shrink across generations. So get to the point already. Variety may be the spice of life, but brevity is its bread and butter. So when it comes to $10 words, save your money and buy a Scrabble board.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 5, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Are you familiar with the word symbiosis? It's a fancy term for a partnership
between two different species, such as bees and flowers. In a symbiosis, both species
depend on each other. I want to tell you
about a remarkable symbiosis between a little bird,
the Clark's nutcracker, and a big tree, the whitebark pine. Whitebark grow in the mountains
of Wyoming, Montana and other western states. They have huge canopies
and lots of needles, which provide cover and shelter
for other plants and animals, and whitebark feed the forest. Their cones are packed with protein. Squirrels gnaw the cones
from the upper branches so they fall to the ground, and then race down to bury them
in piles, or middens. But they don't get to keep all of them; grizzlies and black bears
love finding middens. But there's more to a symbiosis
than one species feeding another. In the case of the Clark's nutcracker,
this bird gives back. While gathering its seeds,
it also replants the trees. Here's how it works:
using her powerful beak, the nutcracker picks apart
a cone in a treetop, pulling out the seeds. She can store up to 80 of them
in a pouch in her throat. Then she flies through the forest looking for a place to cache the seeds an inch under the soil
in piles of up to eight seeds. Nutcrackers can gather
up to 90,000 seeds in the autumn, which they return for
in the winter and spring. And these birds are smart. They remember where all those seeds are. They even use landmarks
on the landscape -- trees, stumps, rocks -- to triangulate to caches
buried deep under the snow. What they don't go back and get,
those seeds become whitebark. This symbiosis is
so important to both species that they've changed,
or evolved, to suit each other. Nutcrackers have developed
long, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones, and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards with the cones at the very ends, so they can offer them
to the nutcrackers as they fly by. That's a symbiosis: Two species cooperating to help
each other for the benefit of all.

a cone in a treetop, pulling out the seeds. She can store up to 80 of them
in a pouch in her throat. Then she flies through the forest looking for a place to cache the seeds an inch under the soil
in piles of up to eight seeds. Nutcrackers can gather
up to 90,000 seeds in the autumn, which they return for
in the winter and spring. And these birds are smart. They remember where all those seeds are. They even use landmarks
on the landscape -- trees, stumps, rocks -- to triangulate to caches
buried deep under the snow. What they don't go back and get,
those seeds become whitebark. This symbiosis is
so important to both species that they've changed,
or evolved, to suit each other. Nutcrackers have developed
long, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones, and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards with the cones at the very ends, so they can offer them
to the nutcrackers as they fly by. That's a symbiosis: Two species cooperating to help
each other for the benefit of all.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 6, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
(Music) Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight, I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is. And then I remember that there's an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earths inside it. The sun seems impossibly big, but in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale, white mist 
stretched across the sky. And it gets worse. There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes, so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand, just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand. And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe. Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles. Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars. But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still. I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us. Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies. We can think of them as part of our universe. They make up a single, giant edifice, obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos that make up you and me. However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes, built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws. Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond, but nonetheless, combined they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes. in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination. And the leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made of up to 10 to the 500 universes. That's a one followed by 500 zeroes, a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe had its own universe and all of the atoms in all of those universes each had their own universe, and you repeated that for two more cycles, you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total -- namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth. But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity. Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties. How's your brain doing? But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling. And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams. In another, not so much. There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing: This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen.

Options: A. By calculating the distance between Swenet and Alexandria and multiplying it by 50, B. By measuring the angle of the shadow in Swenet and comparing it to the angle in Alexandria, C. By using the distance between the two cities and the angle of the shadow to calculate the circumference, D. By using the angle of the shadow and the time of day to calculate the distance between the two cities
Correct Option: C

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: If every atom in our observable universe (which is estimated to have 10^80 atoms) had its own universe (like ours), and all the atoms in all those universes each had ITS own universe, and all the atoms in all THOSE universes had its own universe, how many universes would that be altogether?
Options: A. An infinite number, B. Far more than is predicted by any theory, C. A tiny fraction of what some versions of string theory predict, D. It's a meaningless question, E. My brain just melted
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Unfortunately, the provided generated MCQ does not match the ground truth MCQ. However, I will provide an evaluation of a hypothetical generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Generated MCQ (Hypothetical)**:
Question: If every atom in the observable universe had a universe of its own, and each atom in those universes had another universe, and this process repeated one more time, what would be the total number of universes?
Options: A. More than the number of atoms in the observable universe, B. A small fraction of the number predicted by some versions of string theory, C. An infinite number, D. A number that is impossible to calculate
Correct Option: B
