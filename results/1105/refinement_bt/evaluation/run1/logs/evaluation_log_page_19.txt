**Transcript**:
At a Maryland country fair in 2017, the prize pigs were not 
looking their best. Farmers reported feverish hogs with 
inflamed eyes and running snouts. But while fair officials worried 
about the pigs, the Maryland department of health was 
concerned about a group of sick fairgoers. Some had pet the pigs, while others had 
merely been near their barns; but soon, 40 of these attendees would 
be diagnosed with swine flu. More often than not, sick animals 
don’t infect humans. But when they do, these 
cross-species infections, or viral host jumps, have the potential to produce 
deadly epidemics. So how can pathogens from one species 
infect another, and what makes host jumps so dangerous? Viruses are a type of organic parasite 
infecting nearly all forms of life. To survive and reproduce, they must move
through three stages: contact with a susceptible host, 
infection and replication, and transmission to other individuals. As an example, let’s look 
at human influenza. First, the flu virus encounters 
a new host and makes its way into 
their respiratory tract. This isn’t so difficult, but to survive 
in this new body, the virus must mount a successful 
infection before it’s caught and broken down 
by an immune response. To accomplish this task, viruses have evolved specific interactions
with their host species. Human flu viruses are covered in proteins adapted to bind with matching receptors 
on human respiratory cells. Once inside a cell, the virus employs 
additional adaptations to hijack the host cell’s reproductive 
machinery and replicate its own genetic material. Now the virus only needs to suppress
or evade the host’s immune system long enough to replicate to sufficient 
levels and infect more cells. At this point, the flu can be passed on to
its next victim via any transmission 
of infected bodily fluid. However, this simple sneeze also brings 
the virus in contact with pets, plants, or even your lunch. Viruses are constantly encountering 
new species and attempting to infect them. More often than not, this ends in failure. In most cases, the genetic dissimilarity 
between the two hosts is too great. For a virus adapted to infect humans, a lettuce cell would be a foreign and 
inhospitable landscape. But there are a staggering number 
of viruses circulating in the environment, all with the potential to 
encounter new hosts. And because viruses rapidly reproduce 
by the millions, they can quickly develop random mutations. Most mutations will have no effect, 
or even prove detrimental; but a small proportion may enable the 
pathogen to better infect a new species. The odds of winning this destructive 
genetic lottery increase over time, or if the new species is closely related 
to the virus’ usual host. For a virus adapted to another mammal, infecting a human might just take 
a few lucky mutations. And a virus adapted to chimpanzees, one of our closest genetic relatives,
might barely require any changes at all. It takes more than time and genetic 
similarity for a host jump to be successful. Some viruses come equipped to easily 
infect a new host’s cells, but are then unable to evade 
an immune response. Others might have a difficult time 
transmitting to new hosts. For example, they might make the host’s 
blood contagious, but not their saliva. However, once a host jump reaches 
the transmission stage, the virus becomes much more dangerous. Now gestating within two hosts, the pathogen has twice the odds of 
mutating into a more successful virus. And each new host increases 
the potential for a full-blown epidemic. Virologists are constantly looking for 
mutations that might make viruses such as influenza
more likely to jump. However, predicting the next potential 
epidemic is a major challenge. There’s a huge diversity of viruses 
that we’re only just beginning to uncover. Researchers are tirelessly studying the 
biology of these pathogens. And by monitoring populations to quickly
identify new outbreaks, they can develop vaccines and containment
protocols to stop these deadly diseases.

about the pigs, the Maryland department of health was 
concerned about a group of sick fairgoers. Some had pet the pigs, while others had 
merely been near their barns; but soon, 40 of these attendees would 
be diagnosed with swine flu. More often than not, sick animals 
don’t infect humans. But when they do, these 
cross-species infections, or viral host jumps, have the potential to produce 
deadly epidemics. So how can pathogens from one species 
infect another, and what makes host jumps so dangerous? Viruses are a type of organic parasite 
infecting nearly all forms of life. To survive and reproduce, they must move
through three stages: contact with a susceptible host, 
infection and replication, and transmission to other individuals. As an example, let’s look 
at human influenza. First, the flu virus encounters 
a new host and makes its way into 
their respiratory tract. This isn’t so difficult, but to survive 
in this new body, the virus must mount a successful 
infection before it’s caught and broken down 
by an immune response. To accomplish this task, viruses have evolved specific interactions
with their host species. Human flu viruses are covered in proteins adapted to bind with matching receptors 
on human respiratory cells. Once inside a cell, the virus employs 
additional adaptations to hijack the host cell’s reproductive 
machinery and replicate its own genetic material. Now the virus only needs to suppress
or evade the host’s immune system long enough to replicate to sufficient 
levels and infect more cells. At this point, the flu can be passed on to
its next victim via any transmission 
of infected bodily fluid. However, this simple sneeze also brings 
the virus in contact with pets, plants, or even your lunch. Viruses are constantly encountering 
new species and attempting to infect them. More often than not, this ends in failure. In most cases, the genetic dissimilarity 
between the two hosts is too great. For a virus adapted to infect humans, a lettuce cell would be a foreign and 
inhospitable landscape. But there are a staggering number 
of viruses circulating in the environment, all with the potential to 
encounter new hosts. And because viruses rapidly reproduce 
by the millions, they can quickly develop random mutations. Most mutations will have no effect, 
or even prove detrimental; but a small proportion may enable the 
pathogen to better infect a new species. The odds of winning this destructive 
genetic lottery increase over time, or if the new species is closely related 
to the virus’ usual host. For a virus adapted to another mammal, infecting a human might just take 
a few lucky mutations. And a virus adapted to chimpanzees, one of our closest genetic relatives,
might barely require any changes at all. It takes more than time and genetic 
similarity for a host jump to be successful. Some viruses come equipped to easily 
infect a new host’s cells, but are then unable to evade 
an immune response. Others might have a difficult time 
transmitting to new hosts. For example, they might make the host’s 
blood contagious, but not their saliva. However, once a host jump reaches 
the transmission stage, the virus becomes much more dangerous. Now gestating within two hosts, the pathogen has twice the odds of 
mutating into a more successful virus. And each new host increases 
the potential for a full-blown epidemic. Virologists are constantly looking for 
mutations that might make viruses such as influenza
more likely to jump. However, predicting the next potential 
epidemic is a major challenge. There’s a huge diversity of viruses 
that we’re only just beginning to uncover. Researchers are tirelessly studying the 
biology of these pathogens. And by monitoring populations to quickly
identify new outbreaks, they can develop vaccines and containment
protocols to stop these deadly diseases.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After reviewing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is related to the topic of viruses and their interaction with host cells, while the generated MCQs are related to the topic of anger and its management.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept of interaction or binding, I would choose Question 3: "What is the term for the process of deciding whether a situation is good or bad, fair or unfair, and blameworthy or not?" Options: A. Secondary appraisal, B. Primary appraisal, C. Cognitive distortion, D. Emotional regulation. However, this question is still not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Since there is no matching generated MCQ, I would recommend generating new MCQs that are relevant to the topic of viruses and their interaction with host cells.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ, but if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would choose Question 3 (Index: 3). However, please note that this is not a good match, and new MCQs should be generated to match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
15th century Europeans believed 
they had hit upon a miracle cure: a remedy for epilepsy, hemorrhage, 
bruising, nausea, and virtually any other 
medical ailment. This brown powder could be mixed 
into drinks, made into salves or eaten straight up. It was known as mumia and made 
by grinding up mummified human flesh. The word "cannibal" dates from the 
time of Christopher Columbus; in fact, Columbus may even have 
coined it himself. After coming ashore on the 
island of Guadaloupe, Columbus' initial reports back 
to the Queen of Spain described the indigenous people as 
friendly and peaceful— though he did mention rumors of a 
group called the Caribs, who made violent raids and then cooked 
and ate their prisoners. In response, Queen Isabella granted 
permission to capture and enslave anyone who ate human flesh. When the island failed to produce the gold
Columbus was looking for, he began to label anyone who resisted his 
plundering and kidnapping as a Caribe. Somewhere along the way, the word "Carib" 
became "Canibe" and then "Cannibal." First used by colonizers to dehumanize 
indigenous people, it has since been applied to anyone 
who eats human flesh. So the term comes from an account that 
wasn't based on hard evidence, but cannibalism does have a real and 
much more complex history. It has taken diverse forms— sometimes, 
as with mumia, it doesn't involved recognizable parts 
of the human body. The reasons for cannibalistic practices 
have varied, too. Across cultures and time periods, there's 
evidence of survival cannibalism, when people living through a famine, 
siege or ill-fated expedition had to either eat the bodies of the dead 
or starve to death themselves. But it's also been quite common 
for cultures to normalize some form of eating human 
flesh under ordinary circumstances. Because of false accounts 
like Columbus's, it's difficult to say exactly how common 
cultural cannibalism has been— but there are still some examples of 
accepted cannibalistic practices from within the cultures practicing them. Take the medicinal cannibalism in Europe 
during Columbus's time. Starting in the 15th century, the demand 
for mumia increased. At first, stolen mummies from Egypt 
supplied the mumia craze, but soon the demand was too great to be 
sustained on Egyptian mummies alone, and opportunists stole bodies from 
European cemeteries to turn into mumia. Use of mumia continued for 
hundreds of years. It was listed in the Merck index, 
a popular medical encyclopedia, into the 20th century. And ground up mummies were far from 
the only remedy made from human flesh that was common throughout Europe. Blood, in either liquid or powdered form, 
was used to treat epilepsy, while human liver, gall stones, oil 
distilled from human brains, and pulverized hearts were popular 
medical concoctions. In China, the written record of socially accepted 
cannibalism goes back almost 2,000 years. One particularly common 
form of cannibalism appears to have been filial cannibalism, where adult sons and daughters would 
offer a piece of their own flesh to their parents. This was typically offered as a last-ditch
attempt to cure a sick parent, and wasn't fatal to their offspring— it usually involved flesh from the thigh 
or, less often, a finger. Cannibalistic funerary rites are another 
form of culturally sanctioned cannibalism. Perhaps the best-known example came 
from the Fore people of New Guinea. Through the mid-20th century, members 
of the community would, if possible, make their funerary 
preferences known in advance, sometimes requesting that family members
gather to consume the body after death. Tragically, though these rituals 
honored the deceased, they also spread a deadly disease known 
as kuru through the community. Between the fictionalized stories, 
verifiable practices, and big gaps that still exist 
in our knowledge, there's no one history of cannibalism. But we do know that people have 
been eating each other, volunteering themselves to be eaten, and accusing others of eating 
people for millennia.

**Transcript**:
15th century Europeans believed 
they had hit upon a miracle cure: a remedy for epilepsy, hemorrhage, 
bruising, nausea, and virtually any other 
medical ailment. This brown powder could be mixed 
into drinks, made into salves or eaten straight up. It was known as mumia and made 
by grinding up mummified human flesh. The word "cannibal" dates from the 
time of Christopher Columbus; in fact, Columbus may even have 
coined it himself. After coming ashore on the 
island of Guadaloupe, Columbus' initial reports back 
to the Queen of Spain described the indigenous people as 
friendly and peaceful— though he did mention rumors of a 
group called the Caribs, who made violent raids and then cooked 
and ate their prisoners. In response, Queen Isabella granted 
permission to capture and enslave anyone who ate human flesh. When the island failed to produce the gold
Columbus was looking for, he began to label anyone who resisted his 
plundering and kidnapping as a Caribe. Somewhere along the way, the word "Carib" 
became "Canibe" and then "Cannibal." First used by colonizers to dehumanize 
indigenous people, it has since been applied to anyone 
who eats human flesh. So the term comes from an account that 
wasn't based on hard evidence, but cannibalism does have a real and 
much more complex history. It has taken diverse forms— sometimes, 
as with mumia, it doesn't involved recognizable parts 
of the human body. The reasons for cannibalistic practices 
have varied, too. Across cultures and time periods, there's 
evidence of survival cannibalism, when people living through a famine, 
siege or ill-fated expedition had to either eat the bodies of the dead 
or starve to death themselves. But it's also been quite common 
for cultures to normalize some form of eating human 
flesh under ordinary circumstances. Because of false accounts 
like Columbus's, it's difficult to say exactly how common 
cultural cannibalism has been— but there are still some examples of 
accepted cannibalistic practices from within the cultures practicing them. Take the medicinal cannibalism in Europe 
during Columbus's time. Starting in the 15th century, the demand 
for mumia increased. At first, stolen mummies from Egypt 
supplied the mumia craze, but soon the demand was too great to be 
sustained on Egyptian mummies alone, and opportunists stole bodies from 
European cemeteries to turn into mumia. Use of mumia continued for 
hundreds of years. It was listed in the Merck index, 
a popular medical encyclopedia, into the 20th century. And ground up mummies were far from 
the only remedy made from human flesh that was common throughout Europe. Blood, in either liquid or powdered form, 
was used to treat epilepsy, while human liver, gall stones, oil 
distilled from human brains, and pulverized hearts were popular 
medical concoctions. In China, the written record of socially accepted 
cannibalism goes back almost 2,000 years. One particularly common 
form of cannibalism appears to have been filial cannibalism, where adult sons and daughters would 
offer a piece of their own flesh to their parents. This was typically offered as a last-ditch
attempt to cure a sick parent, and wasn't fatal to their offspring— it usually involved flesh from the thigh 
or, less often, a finger. Cannibalistic funerary rites are another 
form of culturally sanctioned cannibalism. Perhaps the best-known example came 
from the Fore people of New Guinea. Through the mid-20th century, members

**Transcript**:
Pablo Neruda published his first 
collection of poems at age 19. He went on to win the Nobel Prize 
in Literature— and also rescue 2,000 refugees, spend three years in political exile, and run for president of Chile. A romantic and a revolutionary, Neruda was one of the most celebrated 
poets of the 20th century, but also one of the most accessible and
controversial. Originally written in Spanish, his poems often use straightforward 
language and everyday experience to create lasting impact. Neruda was born Ricardo Eliezer Neftalí
Reyes Basoalto in a small Chilean town in 1904. His father didn’t want him to be a poet, so at sixteen he began to write under 
the pen name “Pablo Neruda.” The poems in his early collection "Twenty 
Love Poems and a Song of Despair" were tender and perceptive, illuminating the subtleties 
of love and enchantment. In "Poem VI," for example, he writes: “Tu recuerdo es de luz, de humo, de 
estanque en calma!/ Más allá de tus ojos ardían 
los crepúsculos.” Later, he poured this attention to detail
into poems of appreciation for everyday objects. Many of the 225 short poems in his 
collection "All the Odes" are dedicated to the assortment of small, apparently insignificant items 
that surround us, from a pair of shoelaces to a watermelon. An onion is más hermosa que un ave/ de
plumas cegadoras, while a tuna in the market is a bala 
del profundo/ océano, proyectil natatorio, 
te vi, muerto. Despite this early literary success, Neruda struggled financially, and took a series of diplomatic jobs 
in places such as Burma, Indonesia, Singapore and Spain. In 1936, while Neruda was working at the
consulate in Madrid, civil war broke out and the government was overthrown 
by a fascist military dictatorship. Neruda organized an evacuation of 
refugees from Spain to Chile, saving 2,000 lives. Over a period of twenty years, Neruda captured his experiences abroad in
a three volume poetry collection titled "Residence on Earth." Many of these poems were experimental 
and surreal, merging epic landscapes, 
supernatural themes, and feelings of longing with discussion
of political strife and a poet’s responsibility to 
speak out against injustice. In “I Explain a Few Things” he lingers on haunting details of the 
destruction of the Spanish Civil War. For the rest of his life, Neruda remained committed to 
revolutionary ideals. His politics led to several years of exile before he was able to return 
to Chile in 1952. While in exile, he published his influential 
"Canto General." The book attempts to retell the entire 
history of Latin America through poetry, touching on everything 
from its flora and fauna to its politics and wars, but above all paying homage 
to the common people behind its civilizations’ achievements. Although he continued to travel, after returning from exile Neruda lived in Chile for the 
rest of his life. In 1970, at age 66, Neruda ran for president of Chile before
yielding to Salvador Allende and becoming his close advisor. But in 1973, Allende was overthrown in a 
military coup by General Augusto Pinochet. Neruda died in the hospital 
a couple of weeks later. Because of the timing of his death 
so soon after the coup, rumors swirled that he had died of sadness
or even been assassinated, but the hospital recorded his cause 
of death as cancer. Today, Neruda’s lines are recited at 
protests and marches worldwide. Much like his life, Neruda’s poems bridged romance and
revolution by emphasizing the everyday moments 
worth fighting for.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Neruda was the author of which Latin American classic?

**Transcript**:
Pablo Neruda published his first 
collection of poems at age 19. He went on to win the Nobel Prize 
in Literature— and also rescue 2,000 refugees, spend three years in political exile, and run for president of Chile. A romantic and a revolutionary, Neruda was one of the most celebrated 
poets of the 20th century, but also one of the most accessible and
controversial. Originally written in Spanish, his poems often use straightforward 
language and everyday experience to create lasting impact. Neruda was born Ricardo Eliezer Neftalí
Reyes Basoalto in a small Chilean town in 1904. His father didn’t want him to be a poet, so at sixteen he began to write under 
the pen name “Pablo Neruda.” The poems in his early collection "Twenty 
Love Poems and a Song of Despair" were tender and perceptive, illuminating the subtleties 
of love and enchantment. In "Poem VI," for example, he writes: “Tu recuerdo es de luz, de humo, de 
estanque en calma!/ Más allá de tus ojos ardían 
los crepúsculos.” Later, he poured this attention to detail
into poems of appreciation for everyday objects. Many of the 225 short poems in his 
collection "All the Odes" are dedicated to the assortment of small, apparently insignificant items 
that surround us, from a pair of shoelaces to a watermelon. An onion is más hermosa que un ave/ de
plumas cegadoras, while a tuna in the market is a bala 
del profundo/ océano, proyectil natatorio, 
te vi, muerto. Despite this early literary success, Neruda struggled financially, and took a series of diplomatic jobs 
in places such as Burma, Indonesia, Singapore and Spain. In 1936, while Neruda was working at the
consulate in Madrid, civil war broke out and the government was overthrown 
by a fascist military dictatorship. Neruda organized an evacuation of 
refugees from Spain to Chile, saving 2,000 lives. Over a period of twenty years, Neruda captured his experiences abroad in
a three volume poetry collection titled "Residence on Earth." Many of these poems were experimental 
and surreal, merging epic landscapes, 
supernatural themes, and feelings of longing with discussion
of political strife and a poet’s responsibility to 
speak out against injustice. In “I Explain a Few Things” he lingers on haunting details of the 
destruction of the Spanish Civil War. For the rest of his life, Neruda remained committed to 
revolutionary ideals. His politics led to several years of exile before he was able to return 
to Chile in 1952. While in exile, he published his influential 
"Canto General." The book attempts to retell the entire 
history of Latin America through poetry, touching on everything 
from its flora and fauna to its politics and wars, but above all paying homage 
to the common people behind its civilizations’ achievements. Although he continued to travel, after returning from exile Neruda lived in Chile for the 
rest of his life. In 1970, at age 66, Neruda ran for president of Chile before
yielding to Salvador Allende and becoming his close advisor. But in 1973, Allende was overthrown in a 
military coup by General Augusto Pinochet. Neruda died in the hospital 
a couple of weeks later. Because of the timing of his death 
so soon after the coup, rumors swirled that he had died of sadness
or even been assassinated, but the hospital recorded his cause 
of death as cancer. Today, Neruda’s lines are recited at 
protests and marches worldwide. Much like his life, Neruda’s poems bridged romance and
revolution by emphasizing the everyday moments 
worth fighting for.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a science fiction story, while the ground truth MCQ is about Pablo Neruda's life.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the question format and style, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ at all, but if I had to choose one that is the least dissimilar, it would be:

 Question 8: What is the purpose of the 15-parsec jump at the end of the story? 

Only because it is the only question that mentions an event, but it is still completely unrelated to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must emphasize that this is a very weak match and not a suitable replacement for the ground truth MCQ.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically designed to match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
It’s an incredible discovery: an ancient, abandoned alien space station 
filled with precursor technology. But now, every species in the galaxy is 
in a mad dash to get there first and claim it for themselves. And right away, you’ve got a problem. Your ship’s faster-than-light jump drive 
consumes 1 unit of fuel for every parsec of distance it takes you, and your ship holds only 15 units of fuel. But the space station is 23 parsecs away, and there’s only empty space between 
there and here. There’s one thing that can 
help you, though: dark matter fuel is stable in deep space. That means you can vent a cache of it 
from your fuel chamber, and then come back to pick 
it up again later. Even though your ship holds 
only 15 units of fuel, you’ve been granted use of all 45 units 
in your current location. With some strategic fuel caching 
along the way, you might be able to 
make it all 23 parsecs. So how can you reach the 
alien space station? Answer in 3, 2, 1. It’s possible to solve this riddle using 
as few as two cache points, and there are also valid solutions 
that use more. No matter how you go about it though, the key is determining exactly where 
to cache fuel along your route. Let’s work backwards from the 
alien space station. To reach 23 parsecs, you’ll have to leave the 8-parsec 
mark with a full tank of fuel. The 8-parsec point is too far from the 
start to use as a cache right away; you could jump there, but wouldn’t have 
enough fuel to return to the start, let alone store any for later. So that means you’ll need to find a cache 
somewhere between the start and 8. But where? There’s an interesting pattern 
that can help. At the start you have exactly 3 tanks’ 
worth of fuel. At 8 parsecs you need exactly 1. Is there a point, which we can call 
point X, where you could have exactly 2? That would be useful, because then you 
could refuel there exactly twice, making full use of your storage capacity 
without any waste. Wherever point X is, you’ll jump forward from it twice: once to deposit some fuel at the 8-parsec 
cache point, and a second time for good. So you’ll jump the distance between X and 
8-parsecs 3 times in all. You’d have 2 tanks of fuel at point X, and
need 1 left at the 8 parsec cache point, so you can spend one tank-- or 15 units-- 
going back and forth. Since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5, we can place these two cache points 
5 parsecs apart. Any farther, and you wouldn’t have enough 
fuel to reach the alien space station. So it looks like the earliest we can place
point X is at the 3-parsec mark. Is it possible to transport 30 units of 
fuel there? Let’s try. You set out with a full tank of 15 units. You jump 3 parsecs, drop 9 units 
off at the cache point, and then jump the 3 units home, 
arriving with an empty tank. Repeating this process gets you 18 units 
of fuel at the cache point, and one more jump puts you at the 3-parsec
cache with 30 total units of fuel. So far so good! Next, you jump to the 8-parsec mark, drop off 5 units of fuel, and jump 
back to the 3-parsec mark. You fill up your tank and 
jump forward again, arriving with 10 units of 
fuel in your tank. And now the end is in sight. You beam the 5 units of fuel in from deep 
space to fill your tank to capacity, and type in the coordinates of 
your final destination. A 15-parsec jump leaves you 
running on fumes, but ready to dock with the 
precursor space station. Time to put this alien tech to work and make life better for everyone 
in the galaxy.

fuel to reach the alien space station. So it looks like the earliest we can place
point X is at the 3-parsec mark. Is it possible to transport 30 units of 
fuel there? Let’s try. You set out with a full tank of 15 units. You jump 3 parsecs, drop 9 units 
off at the cache point, and then jump the 3 units home, 
arriving with an empty tank. Repeating this process gets you 18 units 
of fuel at the cache point, and one more jump puts you at the 3-parsec
cache with 30 total units of fuel. So far so good! Next, you jump to the 8-parsec mark, drop off 5 units of fuel, and jump 
back to the 3-parsec mark. You fill up your tank and 
jump forward again, arriving with 10 units of 
fuel in your tank. And now the end is in sight. You beam the 5 units of fuel in from deep 
space to fill your tank to capacity, and type in the coordinates of 
your final destination. A 15-parsec jump leaves you 
running on fumes, but ready to dock with the 
precursor space station. Time to put this alien tech to work and make life better for everyone 
in the galaxy.

**Transcript**:
It’s an incredible discovery: an ancient, abandoned alien space station 
filled with precursor technology. But now, every species in the galaxy is 
in a mad dash to get there first and claim it for themselves. And right away, you’ve got a problem. Your ship’s faster-than-light jump drive 
consumes 1 unit of fuel for every parsec of distance it takes you, and your ship holds only 15 units of fuel. But the space station is 23 parsecs away, and there’s only empty space between 
there and here. There’s one thing that can 
help you, though: dark matter fuel is stable in deep space. That means you can vent a cache of it 
from your fuel chamber, and then come back to pick 
it up again later. Even though your ship holds 
only 15 units of fuel, you’ve been granted use of all 45 units 
in your current location. With some strategic fuel caching 
along the way, you might be able to 
make it all 23 parsecs. So how can you reach the 
alien space station? Answer in 3, 2, 1. It’s possible to solve this riddle using 
as few as two cache points, and there are also valid solutions 
that use more. No matter how you go about it though, the key is determining exactly where 
to cache fuel along your route. Let’s work backwards from the 
alien space station. To reach 23 parsecs, you’ll have to leave the 8-parsec 
mark with a full tank of fuel. The 8-parsec point is too far from the 
start to use as a cache right away; you could jump there, but wouldn’t have 
enough fuel to return to the start, let alone store any for later. So that means you’ll need to find a cache 
somewhere between the start and 8. But where? There’s an interesting pattern 
that can help. At the start you have exactly 3 tanks’ 
worth of fuel. At 8 parsecs you need exactly 1. Is there a point, which we can call 
point X, where you could have exactly 2? That would be useful, because then you 
could refuel there exactly twice, making full use of your storage capacity 
without any waste. Wherever point X is, you’ll jump forward from it twice: once to deposit some fuel at the 8-parsec 
cache point, and a second time for good. So you’ll jump the distance between X and 
8-parsecs 3 times in all. You’d have 2 tanks of fuel at point X, and
need 1 left at the 8 parsec cache point, so you can spend one tank-- or 15 units-- 
going back and forth. Since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5, we can place these two cache points 
5 parsecs apart. Any farther, and you wouldn’t have enough 
fuel to reach the alien space station. So it looks like the earliest we can place
point X is at the 3-parsec mark. Is it possible to transport 30 units of 
fuel there? Let’s try. You set out with a full tank of 15 units. You jump 3 parsecs, drop 9 units 
off at the cache point, and then jump the 3 units home, 
arriving with an empty tank. Repeating this process gets you 18 units 
of fuel at the cache point, and one more jump puts you at the 3-parsec
cache with 30 total units of fuel. So far so good! Next, you jump to the 8-parsec mark, drop off 5 units of fuel, and jump 
back to the 3-parsec mark. You fill up your tank and 
jump forward again, arriving with 10 units of 
fuel in your tank. And now the end is in sight. You beam the 5 units of fuel in from deep 
space to fill your tank to capacity, and type in the coordinates of 
your final destination. A 15-parsec jump leaves you 
running on fumes, but ready to dock with the 
precursor space station. Time to put this alien tech to work and make life better for everyone

**Transcript**:
When Ireneo Funes looked at a glass of 
wine on a table, he saw “all the shoots, clusters, and 
grapes of the vine. He remembered the shapes of the clouds 
in the south at the dawn of the 30th of April of 1882, and he could compare them in his 
recollection with the marbled grain in the design of a leather-bound book 
which he had seen only once, and with the lines in the spray 
which an oar raised in the Rio Negro on the eve of the 
battle of the Quebrancho.” In the short story “Funes, the Memorious,” Jorge Luis Borges explores what it would 
be like to have a perfect memory. His character not only remembers 
everything he has ever seen, but every time he has seen 
it in perfect detail. These details are so overwhelming Funes has to spend his days 
in a dark room, and can only sleep by imagining a part 
of town he has never visited. According to Borges, Funes’s memories even rendered him 
incapable of real thought, because “To think is to forget a 
difference, to generalize, to abstract. In the overly replete world of Funes 
there were nothing but details.” Funes’ limitless memory was just one 
of Borges’s many explorations of infinity. Born in Argentina in 1899, he admired the revolutionaries 
of his mother’s family but took after his father’s bookish clan. His body of essays, poems, and stories, 
or, as he called them, ficciones pioneered the literary style of 
“lo real maravilloso,” known in English as Magical Realism— and each was just a few pages long. Though Borges was not interested in 
writing long books, he was an avid reader, recruiting friends to read to him 
after he went blind in middle age. He said his image of paradise was an 
infinite library, an idea he brought to life in 
“The library of Babel.” Built out of countless identical rooms, each containing the same number of 
books of the same length, the library of babel is its own universe. It contains every possible 
variation of text, so there are some profound books, but also countless tomes 
of complete gibberish. The narrator has spent his entire life wandering this vast labyrinth 
of information in a possibly futile search for meaning. Labyrinths appeared over and over 
in Borges’ work. In “The Garden of Forking Paths,” as Yu Tsun winds his way through 
country roads, he remembers a lost labyrinth 
built by one of his ancestors. Over the course of the story, he finds out the labyrinth is not a 
physical maze but a novel. And this novel reveals that the real 
Garden of Forking Paths is time: in every instant, there are infinite 
possible courses of action. And as one moment follows another, each possibility begets another 
set of divergent futures. Borges laid out infinite expanses of time
in his labyrinths, but he also explored the idea of 
condensing all of time into a single moment. In “The God’s Script,” at the very beginning of the world the god writes exactly one message into the spots of the jaguars, who then “love and reproduce without end, in caverns, in cane fields, on islands, in order that the last men 
might receive it.” The last man turns out to be a tenacious
old priest who spends years memorizing and 
deciphering the jaguar’s spots, culminating in an epiphany where he 
finally understands the god’s message. Imprisoned deep underground, he has no one to share this meaning with, and it changes nothing 
about his circumstances, but he doesn’t mind: in that one moment, he has experienced all the experience of
everyone who has ever existed. Reading Borges, you might catch
a glimpse of infinity too.

in Borges’ work. In “The Garden of Forking Paths,” as Yu Tsun winds his way through 
country roads, he remembers a lost labyrinth 
built by one of his ancestors. Over the course of the story, he finds out the labyrinth is not a 
physical maze but a novel. And this novel reveals that the real 
Garden of Forking Paths is time: in every instant, there are infinite 
possible courses of action. And as one moment follows another, each possibility begets another 
set of divergent futures. Borges laid out infinite expanses of time
in his labyrinths, but he also explored the idea of 
condensing all of time into a single moment. In “The God’s Script,” at the very beginning of the world the god writes exactly one message into the spots of the jaguars, who then “love and reproduce without end, in caverns, in cane fields, on islands, in order that the last men 
might receive it.” The last man turns out to be a tenacious
old priest who spends years memorizing and 
deciphering the jaguar’s spots, culminating in an epiphany where he 
finally understands the god’s message. Imprisoned deep underground, he has no one to share this meaning with, and it changes nothing 
about his circumstances, but he doesn’t mind: in that one moment, he has experienced all the experience of
everyone who has ever existed. Reading Borges, you might catch
a glimpse of infinity too.

**Transcript**:
When Ireneo Funes looked at a glass of 
wine on a table, he saw “all the shoots, clusters, and 
grapes of the vine. He remembered the shapes of the clouds 
in the south at the dawn of the 30th of April of 1882, and he could compare them in his 
recollection with the marbled grain in the design of a leather-bound book 
which he had seen only once, and with the lines in the spray 
which an oar raised in the Rio Negro on the eve of the 
battle of the Quebrancho.” In the short story “Funes, the Memorious,” Jorge Luis Borges explores what it would 
be like to have a perfect memory. His character not only remembers 
everything he has ever seen, but every time he has seen 
it in perfect detail. These details are so overwhelming Funes has to spend his days 
in a dark room, and can only sleep by imagining a part 
of town he has never visited. According to Borges, Funes’s memories even rendered him 
incapable of real thought, because “To think is to forget a 
difference, to generalize, to abstract. In the overly replete world of Funes 
there were nothing but details.” Funes’ limitless memory was just one 
of Borges’s many explorations of infinity. Born in Argentina in 1899, he admired the revolutionaries 
of his mother’s family but took after his father’s bookish clan. His body of essays, poems, and stories, 
or, as he called them, ficciones pioneered the literary style of 
“lo real maravilloso,” known in English as Magical Realism— and each was just a few pages long. Though Borges was not interested in 
writing long books, he was an avid reader, recruiting friends to read to him 
after he went blind in middle age. He said his image of paradise was an 
infinite library, an idea he brought to life in 
“The library of Babel.” Built out of countless identical rooms, each containing the same number of 
books of the same length, the library of babel is its own universe. It contains every possible 
variation of text, so there are some profound books, but also countless tomes 
of complete gibberish. The narrator has spent his entire life wandering this vast labyrinth 
of information in a possibly futile search for meaning. Labyrinths appeared over and over 
in Borges’ work. In “The Garden of Forking Paths,” as Yu Tsun winds his way through

**Transcript**:
Most of the forest lives in the 
shadow of the giants that make up the highest canopy. These are the oldest trees, with hundreds of children and 
thousands of grandchildren. They check in with their neighbors, 
sharing food, supplies, and wisdom gained over their long lives. They do all this rooted in place, unable 
to speak, reach out, or move around. The secret to their success lies 
under the forest floor, where vast root systems support the 
towering trunks above. Partnering with these roots are symbiotic 
fungi called mycorrhizae. These fungi have countless branching, 
thread-like hyphae that together make up the mycelium. The mycelium spreads across a much larger 
area than the tree root system and connect the roots of different 
trees together. These connections form 
mycorrhizal networks. Through mycorrhizal networks, fungi can pass resources and signaling 
molecules between trees. We know the oldest trees have the 
largest mycorrhizal networks with the most connections to other trees, but these connections are incredibly 
complicated to trace. That’s because there are about a hundred 
species of mycorrhizal fungi– and an individual tree might be colonized 
by dozens of different fungal organisms, each of which connects to a 
unique set of other trees, which in turn each have their own unique 
set of fungal associations. To get a sense of how substances flow 
through this network, let’s zoom in on sugars, as they travel from a mature tree to a 
neighboring seedling. Sugar’s journey starts high above 
the ground, in the leaves of the tallest trees 
above the canopy. The leaves use the ample sunlight up there
to create sugars through photosynthesis. This essential fuel then travels 
through the tree to the base of the trunk in the thick sap. From there, sugar flows down to the roots. Mycorrhizal fungi encounter the 
tips of the roots and either surround or penetrate 
the outer root cells, depending on the type of fungi. Fungi cannot produce sugars, though they 
need them for fuel just like trees do. They can, however, collect nutrients from the soil much 
more efficiently than tree roots— and pass these nutrients into 
the tree roots. In general, substances flow from where they are more 
abundant to where they are less abundant, or from source to sink. That means that the sugars flow from the 
tree roots into the fungal hyphae. Once the sugars enter the fungus, they travel along the hyphae through 
pores between cells or through special hollow 
transporter hyphae. The fungus absorbs some of the sugars, but some travels on and enters 
the roots of a neighboring tree, a seedling that grows in the shade and 
has less opportunity to photosynthesize sugars. But why does fungus transport resources 
from tree to tree? This is one of the mysteries of the 
mycorrhizal networks. It makes sense for fungus to exchange soil
nutrients and sugar with a tree— both parties benefit. The fungus likely benefits in less obvious
ways from being part of a network between trees, but the exact ways 
aren’t totally clear. Maybe the fungus benefits from 
having connections with as many different trees as possible, and maximizes its connections by shuttling
molecules between trees. Or maybe plants reduce their 
contributions to fungi if the fungi don’t facilitate exchanges 
between trees. Whatever the reasons, these fungi pass an incredible amount 
of information between trees. Through the mycorrhizae, trees can tell 
when nutrients or signaling molecules are coming from a member of their 
own species or not. They can even tell when information is 
coming from a close relative like a sibling or parent. Trees can also share information 
about events like drought or insect attacks through their 
fungal networks, causing their neighbors to increase 
production of protective enzymes in anticipation of threats. The forest’s health relies on these 
intricate communications and exchanges. With everything so deeply interconnected, what impacts one species is bound 
to impact others.

tree roots into the fungal hyphae. Once the sugars enter the fungus, they travel along the hyphae through 
pores between cells or through special hollow 
transporter hyphae. The fungus absorbs some of the sugars, but some travels on and enters 
the roots of a neighboring tree, a seedling that grows in the shade and 
has less opportunity to photosynthesize sugars. But why does fungus transport resources 
from tree to tree? This is one of the mysteries of the 
mycorrhizal networks. It makes sense for fungus to exchange soil
nutrients and sugar with a tree— both parties benefit. The fungus likely benefits in less obvious
ways from being part of a network between trees, but the exact ways 
aren’t totally clear. Maybe the fungus benefits from 
having connections with as many different trees as possible, and maximizes its connections by shuttling
molecules between trees. Or maybe plants reduce their 
contributions to fungi if the fungi don’t facilitate exchanges 
between trees. Whatever the reasons, these fungi pass an incredible amount 
of information between trees. Through the mycorrhizae, trees can tell 
when nutrients or signaling molecules are coming from a member of their 
own species or not. They can even tell when information is 
coming from a close relative like a sibling or parent. Trees can also share information 
about events like drought or insect attacks through their 
fungal networks, causing their neighbors to increase 
production of protective enzymes in anticipation of threats. The forest’s health relies on these 
intricate communications and exchanges. With everything so deeply interconnected, what impacts one species is bound 
to impact others.

**Transcript**:
Most of the forest lives in the 
shadow of the giants that make up the highest canopy. These are the oldest trees, with hundreds of children and 
thousands of grandchildren. They check in with their neighbors, 
sharing food, supplies, and wisdom gained over their long lives. They do all this rooted in place, unable 
to speak, reach out, or move around. The secret to their success lies 
under the forest floor, where vast root systems support the 
towering trunks above. Partnering with these roots are symbiotic 
fungi called mycorrhizae. These fungi have countless branching, 
thread-like hyphae that together make up the mycelium. The mycelium spreads across a much larger 
area than the tree root system and connect the roots of different 
trees together. These connections form 
mycorrhizal networks. Through mycorrhizal networks, fungi can pass resources and signaling 
molecules between trees. We know the oldest trees have the 
largest mycorrhizal networks with the most connections to other trees, but these connections are incredibly 
complicated to trace. That’s because there are about a hundred 
species of mycorrhizal fungi– and an individual tree might be colonized 
by dozens of different fungal organisms, each of which connects to a 
unique set of other trees, which in turn each have their own unique 
set of fungal associations. To get a sense of how substances flow 
through this network, let’s zoom in on sugars, as they travel from a mature tree to a 
neighboring seedling. Sugar’s journey starts high above 
the ground, in the leaves of the tallest trees 
above the canopy. The leaves use the ample sunlight up there
to create sugars through photosynthesis. This essential fuel then travels 
through the tree to the base of the trunk in the thick sap. From there, sugar flows down to the roots. Mycorrhizal fungi encounter the 
tips of the roots and either surround or penetrate 
the outer root cells, depending on the type of fungi. Fungi cannot produce sugars, though they 
need them for fuel just like trees do. They can, however, collect nutrients from the soil much 
more efficiently than tree roots— and pass these nutrients into 
the tree roots. In general, substances flow from where they are more 
abundant to where they are less abundant, or from source to sink. That means that the sugars flow from the 
tree roots into the fungal hyphae. Once the sugars enter the fungus, they travel along the hyphae through 
pores between cells or through special hollow

**Transcript**:
In 2008, archeologists uncovered two 
9,000-year old skeletons. There’s no definitive way of knowing what 
killed these ancient people, but we do know their bones were infected 
by an all too familiar bacterium. The ancient Greeks knew its consumptive 
effects as phthisis; the Incans called it chaky oncay; 
and the English called it tuberculosis. Today, tuberculosis, or TB, is still one of the world’s biggest 
infectious killers, causing more deaths than malaria or 
even HIV and AIDS. But what exactly is this disease, and how 
has this pathogen persisted for so long? Typically, TB bacteria called 
mycobacterium tuberculosis, are airborne. They travel into our airways and 
infect our lungs. Here, immune cells called macrophages 
rush to the infection site, attempting to absorb and break down 
the bacterial invaders. In many cases, this response is enough 
to remove the bacteria. But in individuals with other 
medical conditions– ranging from malnutrition and HIV to 
diabetes and pregnancy –the immune response may not be 
strong enough to destroy the intruder. If so, mycobacterium tuberculosis will 
reproduce inside those macrophages, and form colonies in the 
surrounding lung tissue. As they infect more cells, the bacteria employ cell-degrading enzymes
that destroy the infected tissue, triggering chest pain, and causing 
patients to cough up blood. The damage to the lungs leads to 
oxygen deprivation. This begins a flood of hormonal changes– including a decrease in appetite and 
iron production. From here, microbes can spread to the 
skeletal system, causing back pain and difficulty moving; to the kidneys and intestines, 
causing abdominal pain; and to the brain, causing headaches 
and even impaired consciousness. These symptoms produce the 
classic image of TB: weight loss, a hacking, bloody cough, 
and ashen skin. This ghostly appearance earned TB 
the title of the ‘White Plague’ in Victorian-era England. During this period, tuberculosis was 
considered a ‘romantic disease,' because it tended to affect poverty-
stricken artists and poets– those with weaker immune systems. TB’s outward symptoms even helped 
fuel the popular myth of vampirism. In spite of– or perhaps because of 
these less than scientific concerns, this period also marked the first strides 
toward curing TB. In 1882, the German physician Robert Koch identified the disease’s 
bacterial origins. 13 years later, physicist Wilhelm 
Roentgen  discovered the X-ray, enabling physicians to diagnose and track 
its progression through the body. These techniques allowed researchers to 
develop reliable and effective vaccines– first for smallpox, and again in 1921, when scientists developed the BCG 
vaccine to battle TB. These developments laid the groundwork 
for the modern field of antibiotics– currently home to our most effective 
TB treatments. But, antibiotics fail to address a major 
diagnostic complication: about 90% of people infected with TB 
don’t show any symptoms. In these latent infections, the TB 
bacterium may be dormant, only activating when someone’s immune 
system is too weak to mount a defense. This makes TB much harder to diagnose. And even when properly identified, traditional treatments can take 
up to 9 months, requiring multiple drugs and a high 
potential for side effects. This discourages people from finishing 
the full course, and partial treatment enables bacteria to 
develop resistance to these drugs. Today, the disease is still prevalent 
in 30 countries, most of which face other health crises that exacerbate TB and 
trigger latent cases. Worse still, accessing treatment can 
be difficult in many of these countries, and the stigma towards TB can discourage 
people from getting the help they need. Health experts agree we need to 
develop better diagnostics, faster acting antibiotics, and more 
effective vaccines. Researchers have already developed a urine
test that yields results in 12 hours, as well as a new oral treatment that could
cut treatment time by 75%. Hopefully, with advancements like these, we’ll finally be able to make TB 
exclusively a thing of the past.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the type of pathogen that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) is, while the generated MCQs are about astrobiology and the search for life on other planets.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that Question 9 is the closest match. But please note that the content and intent of Question 9 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

Since there is no matching generated MCQ, I will not provide an index. Instead, I suggest generating new MCQs that are relevant to the topic of the transcript, which is about tuberculosis and its effects on the human body.

**Transcript**:
In 2008, archeologists uncovered two 
9,000-year old skeletons. There’s no definitive way of knowing what 
killed these ancient people, but we do know their bones were infected 
by an all too familiar bacterium. The ancient Greeks knew its consumptive 
effects as phthisis; the Incans called it chaky oncay; 
and the English called it tuberculosis. Today, tuberculosis, or TB, is still one of the world’s biggest 
infectious killers, causing more deaths than malaria or 
even HIV and AIDS. But what exactly is this disease, and how 
has this pathogen persisted for so long? Typically, TB bacteria called 
mycobacterium tuberculosis, are airborne. They travel into our airways and 
infect our lungs. Here, immune cells called macrophages 
rush to the infection site, attempting to absorb and break down 
the bacterial invaders. In many cases, this response is enough 
to remove the bacteria. But in individuals with other 
medical conditions– ranging from malnutrition and HIV to 
diabetes and pregnancy –the immune response may not be 
strong enough to destroy the intruder. If so, mycobacterium tuberculosis will 
reproduce inside those macrophages, and form colonies in the 
surrounding lung tissue. As they infect more cells, the bacteria employ cell-degrading enzymes
that destroy the infected tissue, triggering chest pain, and causing 
patients to cough up blood. The damage to the lungs leads to 
oxygen deprivation. This begins a flood of hormonal changes– including a decrease in appetite and 
iron production. From here, microbes can spread to the 
skeletal system, causing back pain and difficulty moving; to the kidneys and intestines, 
causing abdominal pain; and to the brain, causing headaches 
and even impaired consciousness. These symptoms produce the 
classic image of TB: weight loss, a hacking, bloody cough, 
and ashen skin. This ghostly appearance earned TB 
the title of the ‘White Plague’ in Victorian-era England. During this period, tuberculosis was 
considered a ‘romantic disease,' because it tended to affect poverty-
stricken artists and poets– those with weaker immune systems. TB’s outward symptoms even helped 
fuel the popular myth of vampirism. In spite of– or perhaps because of 
these less than scientific concerns, this period also marked the first strides 
toward curing TB. In 1882, the German physician Robert Koch identified the disease’s 
bacterial origins. 13 years later, physicist Wilhelm 
Roentgen  discovered the X-ray, enabling physicians to diagnose and track 
its progression through the body. These techniques allowed researchers to 
develop reliable and effective vaccines– first for smallpox, and again in 1921, when scientists developed the BCG 
vaccine to battle TB. These developments laid the groundwork 
for the modern field of antibiotics– currently home to our most effective 
TB treatments. But, antibiotics fail to address a major 
diagnostic complication: about 90% of people infected with TB 
don’t show any symptoms. In these latent infections, the TB 
bacterium may be dormant, only activating when someone’s immune 
system is too weak to mount a defense. This makes TB much harder to diagnose. And even when properly identified, traditional treatments can take 
up to 9 months, requiring multiple drugs and a high 
potential for side effects. This discourages people from finishing 
the full course, and partial treatment enables bacteria to 
develop resistance to these drugs. Today, the disease is still prevalent 
in 30 countries, most of which face other health crises that exacerbate TB and 
trigger latent cases. Worse still, accessing treatment can 
be difficult in many of these countries, and the stigma towards TB can discourage 
people from getting the help they need. Health experts agree we need to 
develop better diagnostics, faster acting antibiotics, and more 
effective vaccines. Researchers have already developed a urine
test that yields results in 12 hours, as well as a new oral treatment that could
cut treatment time by 75%. Hopefully, with advancements like these, we’ll finally be able to make TB 
exclusively a thing of the past.

**Transcript**:
In 2008, archeologists uncovered two 
9,000-year old skeletons. There’s no definitive way of knowing what 
killed these ancient people, but we do know their bones were infected 
by an all too familiar bacterium. The ancient Greeks knew its consumptive 
effects as phthisis; the Incans called it chaky oncay; 
and the English called it tuberculosis. Today, tuberculosis, or TB, is still one of the world’s biggest 
infectious killers, causing more deaths than malaria or 
even HIV and AIDS. But what exactly is this disease, and how 
has this pathogen persisted for so long? Typically, TB bacteria called 
mycobacterium tuberculosis, are airborne. They travel into our airways and 
infect our lungs. Here, immune cells called macrophages 
rush to the infection site, attempting to absorb and break down 
the bacterial invaders. In many cases, this response is enough 
to remove the bacteria. But in individuals with other 
medical conditions– ranging from malnutrition and HIV to 
diabetes and pregnancy –the immune response may not be 
strong enough to destroy the intruder. If so, mycobacterium tuberculosis will 
reproduce inside those macrophages, and form colonies in the 
surrounding lung tissue. As they infect more cells, the bacteria employ cell-degrading enzymes
that destroy the infected tissue, triggering chest pain, and causing 
patients to cough up blood. The damage to the lungs leads to 
oxygen deprivation. This begins a flood of hormonal changes– including a decrease in appetite and 
iron production. From here, microbes can spread to the 
skeletal system, causing back pain and difficulty moving; to the kidneys and intestines, 
causing abdominal pain; and to the brain, causing headaches 
and even impaired consciousness. These symptoms produce the 
classic image of TB: weight loss, a hacking, bloody cough, 
and ashen skin. This ghostly appearance earned TB 
the title of the ‘White Plague’ in Victorian-era England. During this period, tuberculosis was 
considered a ‘romantic disease,' because it tended to affect poverty-
stricken artists and poets– those with weaker immune systems. TB’s outward symptoms even helped 
fuel the popular myth of vampirism. In spite of– or perhaps because of 
these less than scientific concerns, this period also marked the first strides 
toward curing TB. In 1882, the German physician Robert Koch identified the disease’s 
bacterial origins. 13 years later, physicist Wilhelm 
Roentgen  discovered the X-ray, enabling physicians to diagnose and track 
its progression through the body. These techniques allowed researchers to 
develop reliable and effective vaccines– first for smallpox, and again in 1921, when scientists developed the BCG 
vaccine to battle TB. These developments laid the groundwork 
for the modern field of antibiotics– currently home to our most effective 
TB treatments. But, antibiotics fail to address a major 
diagnostic complication: about 90% of people infected with TB 
don’t show any symptoms. In these latent infections, the TB 
bacterium may be dormant, only activating when someone’s immune 
system is too weak to mount a defense. This makes TB much harder to diagnose. And even when properly identified, traditional treatments can take 
up to 9 months, requiring multiple drugs and a high 
potential for side effects. This discourages people from finishing 
the full course, and partial treatment enables bacteria to 
develop resistance to these drugs. Today, the disease is still prevalent 
in 30 countries, most of which face other health crises that exacerbate TB and 
trigger latent cases. Worse still, accessing treatment can 
be difficult in many of these countries, and the stigma towards TB can discourage 
people from getting the help they need. Health experts agree we need to 
develop better diagnostics, faster acting antibiotics, and more 
effective vaccines. Researchers have already developed a urine
test that yields results in 12 hours, as well as a new oral treatment that could
cut treatment time by 75%. Hopefully, with advancements like these, we’ll finally be able to make TB 
exclusively a thing of the past.

**Transcript**:
Deep in our solar system, a new era of space exploration
is unfolding. Beneath the thick ice of Europa, in the vapor plumes on Enceladus, and within the methane lakes of Titan, astrobiologists are on the hunt 
for extraterrestrial life. We’ve honed in on these three moons 
because each is an ‘ocean world,’ an environment that contains 
a liquid ocean– and liquid can support 
the formation of life. Living organisms have to be able to grow, 
reproduce, and feed themselves, among other things. All of those functions require the 
formation of complex molecules from more basic components. Liquids such as water allow chemical 
compounds to remain in suspension instead of sinking under 
the force of gravity. This enables them to interact frequently
in a 3-dimensional space and, in the right conditions, go through chemical reactions that 
lead to the formation of living matter. That alone isn’t enough; the small but complex biomolecules 
that we’re familiar with are sensitive to temperature— too hot or cold, and they won’t mix. Liquid water has an additional advantage in that it’s relatively 
temperature-stable, meaning it can insulate molecules against
large shifts in heat. On Earth, these and other conditions in 
aquatic environments may have supported the emergence 
of life billions of years ago. Tantalizingly, the same could be true
in other parts of our solar system, like these three icy moons. Europa, which is a moon of Jupiter, is probably the most 
intriguing ocean world. Beneath a surface layer of ice thicker 
than Mount Everest, there exists a liquid ocean as much as
100 kilometers deep. Astrobiologists think this hidden 
ocean could harbor life. Thanks to the Galileo probe, we can deduce that its 
potential salt content is similar to that of some lakes on Earth. But most of its characteristics will be a 
mystery until we can explore it further. Like Jupiter, Saturn also has moons that 
might have the right conditions for life. For instance– Enceladus is a tiny ball of 
ice that’s small enough to nestle within the surface area 
of the Gulf of Mexico. Similarly to Europa, it likely contains an
ocean deep under the ice. But Enceladus also has geysers that frequently vent water vapor and 
tiny ice grains into space. Astrobiologists are curious about whether
these geysers are connected to the ocean below. They hope to send a probe to test whether
the geysers’ plumes of vapor contain life-enabling material
from that hidden sea. Although it’s the best known substance 
for nurturing life, water isn’t necessarily the only medium
that can support living things. Take Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, which has a thick nitrogen atmosphere containing methane and many other 
organic molecules. Its clouds condense and 
rain onto Titan’s surface, sustaining lakes and seas 
full of liquid methane. This compound’s particular chemistry means
it’s not as supportive a medium as water. But, paired with the high quantities 
of organic material that also rain down from the sky, these bodies of liquid methane could
possibly support unfamiliar life forms. So what might indicate that life exists on
these or other worlds? If it is out there, astrobiologists 
speculate that it would be microscopic, comparable to the bacteria 
we have on earth. This would make it difficult to directly 
observe from a great distance, so astrobiologists seek clues 
called biosignatures. Those may be cells, fossils, or mineral 
traces left behind by living things. And finding any biosignatures will be 
challenging for many reasons. One of the biggest concerns is to make sure we sterilize our 
probes extremely thoroughly. Otherwise we could accidentally 
contaminate ocean worlds with Earth’s own bacteria, which could destroy alien life. Titan, Enceladus, and Europa are just three of possibly many 
ocean worlds that we could explore. We already know of several other 
candidates in our solar system, including Jupiter’s moons Callisto and 
Ganymede, Neptune’s Triton, and even Pluto. If there’s this much potential for life
to exist in our own tiny solar system, what unimagined secrets might the 
rest of the universe contain?

potential salt content is similar to that of some lakes on Earth. But most of its characteristics will be a 
mystery until we can explore it further. Like Jupiter, Saturn also has moons that 
might have the right conditions for life. For instance– Enceladus is a tiny ball of 
ice that’s small enough to nestle within the surface area 
of the Gulf of Mexico. Similarly to Europa, it likely contains an
ocean deep under the ice. But Enceladus also has geysers that frequently vent water vapor and 
tiny ice grains into space. Astrobiologists are curious about whether
these geysers are connected to the ocean below. They hope to send a probe to test whether
the geysers’ plumes of vapor contain life-enabling material
from that hidden sea. Although it’s the best known substance 
for nurturing life, water isn’t necessarily the only medium
that can support living things. Take Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, which has a thick nitrogen atmosphere containing methane and many other 
organic molecules. Its clouds condense and 
rain onto Titan’s surface, sustaining lakes and seas 
full of liquid methane. This compound’s particular chemistry means
it’s not as supportive a medium as water. But, paired with the high quantities 
of organic material that also rain down from the sky, these bodies of liquid methane could
possibly support unfamiliar life forms. So what might indicate that life exists on
these or other worlds? If it is out there, astrobiologists 
speculate that it would be microscopic, comparable to the bacteria 
we have on earth. This would make it difficult to directly 
observe from a great distance, so astrobiologists seek clues 
called biosignatures. Those may be cells, fossils, or mineral 
traces left behind by living things. And finding any biosignatures will be 
challenging for many reasons. One of the biggest concerns is to make sure we sterilize our 
probes extremely thoroughly. Otherwise we could accidentally 
contaminate ocean worlds with Earth’s own bacteria, which could destroy alien life. Titan, Enceladus, and Europa are just three of possibly many 
ocean worlds that we could explore. We already know of several other 
candidates in our solar system, including Jupiter’s moons Callisto and 
Ganymede, Neptune’s Triton, and even Pluto. If there’s this much potential for life
to exist in our own tiny solar system, what unimagined secrets might the 
rest of the universe contain?

**Transcript**:
Deep in our solar system, a new era of space exploration
is unfolding. Beneath the thick ice of Europa, in the vapor plumes on Enceladus, and within the methane lakes of Titan, astrobiologists are on the hunt 
for extraterrestrial life. We’ve honed in on these three moons 
because each is an ‘ocean world,’ an environment that contains 
a liquid ocean– and liquid can support 
the formation of life. Living organisms have to be able to grow, 
reproduce, and feed themselves, among other things. All of those functions require the 
formation of complex molecules from more basic components. Liquids such as water allow chemical 
compounds to remain in suspension instead of sinking under 
the force of gravity. This enables them to interact frequently
in a 3-dimensional space and, in the right conditions, go through chemical reactions that 
lead to the formation of living matter. That alone isn’t enough; the small but complex biomolecules 
that we’re familiar with are sensitive to temperature— too hot or cold, and they won’t mix. Liquid water has an additional advantage in that it’s relatively 
temperature-stable, meaning it can insulate molecules against
large shifts in heat. On Earth, these and other conditions in 
aquatic environments may have supported the emergence 
of life billions of years ago. Tantalizingly, the same could be true
in other parts of our solar system, like these three icy moons. Europa, which is a moon of Jupiter, is probably the most 
intriguing ocean world. Beneath a surface layer of ice thicker 
than Mount Everest, there exists a liquid ocean as much as
100 kilometers deep. Astrobiologists think this hidden 
ocean could harbor life. Thanks to the Galileo probe, we can deduce that its

**Transcript**:
Deep beneath the geysers and hot springs 
of Yellowstone Caldera lies a magma chamber produced by a 
hot spot in the earth’s mantle. As the magma moves towards 
the Earth’s surface, it crystallizes to form young, 
hot igneous rocks. The heat from these rocks drives 
groundwater towards the surface. As the water cools, ions precipitate out 
as mineral crystals, including quartz crystals from silicon 
and oxygen, feldspar from potassium, aluminum, 
silicon, and oxygen, galena from lead and sulfur. Many of these crystals have signature 
shapes— take this cascade of pointed quartz, 
or this pile of galena cubes. But what causes them to grow into these
shapes again and again? Part of the answer lies in their atoms. Every crystal’s atoms are arranged 
in a highly organized, repeating pattern. This pattern is the defining 
feature of a crystal, and isn’t restricted to minerals— sand, ice, sugar, chocolate, ceramics, 
metals, DNA, and even some liquids have 
crystalline structures. Each crystalline material’s atomic 
arrangement falls into one of six different families: cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, 
monoclinic, triclinic, and hexagonal. Given the appropriate conditions, crystals will grow into geometric shapes that reflect the arrangement 
of their atoms. Take galena, which has a cubic structure 
composed of lead and sulfur atoms. The relatively large lead atoms are arranged in a three-dimensional 
grid 90 degrees from one another, while the relatively small sulfur atoms 
fit neatly between them. As the crystal grows, locations like these
attract sulfur atoms, while lead will tend to 
bond to these places. Eventually, they will complete the grid 
of bonded atoms. This means the 90 degree grid pattern 
of galena’s crystalline structure is reflected in the visible 
shape of the crystal. Quartz, meanwhile, has a hexagonal 
crystalline structure. This means that on one plane its atoms 
are arranged in hexagons. In three dimensions, these hexagons are 
composed of many interlocking pyramids made up of one silicon atom 
and four oxygen atoms. So the signature shape of a quartz 
crystal is a six-sided column with pointed tips. Depending on environmental conditions, most crystals have the potential to form
multiple geometric shapes. For example, diamonds, which form deep
in the Earth’s mantle, have a cubic crystalline structure and can
grow into either cubes or octahedrons. Which shape a particular 
diamond grows into depends on the conditions where it grows, including pressure, temperature, 
and chemical environment. While we can’t directly observe growth 
conditions in the mantle, laboratory experiments have shown some
evidence that diamonds tend to grow into cubes at 
lower temperatures and octahedrons at higher temperatures. Trace amounts of water, silicon, 
germanium, or magnesium might also influence a diamond’s shape. And diamonds never naturally grow into the
shapes found in jewelry— those diamonds have been cut to 
showcase sparkle and clarity. Environmental conditions can also 
influence whether crystals form at all. Glass is made of melted quartz sand, but it isn’t crystalline. That’s because glass cools 
relatively quickly, and the atoms do not have time to arrange
themselves into the ordered structure 
of a quartz crystal. Instead, the random arrangement 
of the atoms in the melted glass is locked in upon cooling. Many crystals don’t form geometric shapes because they grow in extremely close 
quarters with other crystals. Rocks like granite are full of crystals, but none have recognizable shapes. As magma cools and solidifies, many minerals within it crystallize at the
same time and quickly run out of space. And certain crystals, like turquoise, don’t grow into any discernible geometric
shape in most environmental conditions, even given adequate space. Every crystal’s atomic structure has 
unique properties, and while these properties may not have
any bearing on human emotional needs, they do have powerful applications 
in materials science and medicine.

and four oxygen atoms. So the signature shape of a quartz 
crystal is a six-sided column with pointed tips. Depending on environmental conditions, most crystals have the potential to form
multiple geometric shapes. For example, diamonds, which form deep
in the Earth’s mantle, have a cubic crystalline structure and can
grow into either cubes or octahedrons. Which shape a particular 
diamond grows into depends on the conditions where it grows, including pressure, temperature, 
and chemical environment. While we can’t directly observe growth 
conditions in the mantle, laboratory experiments have shown some
evidence that diamonds tend to grow into cubes at 
lower temperatures and octahedrons at higher temperatures. Trace amounts of water, silicon, 
germanium, or magnesium might also influence a diamond’s shape. And diamonds never naturally grow into the
shapes found in jewelry— those diamonds have been cut to 
showcase sparkle and clarity. Environmental conditions can also 
influence whether crystals form at all. Glass is made of melted quartz sand, but it isn’t crystalline. That’s because glass cools 
relatively quickly, and the atoms do not have time to arrange
themselves into the ordered structure 
of a quartz crystal. Instead, the random arrangement 
of the atoms in the melted glass is locked in upon cooling. Many crystals don’t form geometric shapes because they grow in extremely close 
quarters with other crystals. Rocks like granite are full of crystals, but none have recognizable shapes. As magma cools and solidifies, many minerals within it crystallize at the
same time and quickly run out of space. And certain crystals, like turquoise, don’t grow into any discernible geometric
shape in most environmental conditions, even given adequate space. Every crystal’s atomic structure has 
unique properties, and while these properties may not have
any bearing on human emotional needs, they do have powerful applications 
in materials science and medicine.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Deep beneath the geysers and hot springs 
of Yellowstone Caldera lies a magma chamber produced by a 
hot spot in the earth’s mantle. As the magma moves towards 
the Earth’s surface, it crystallizes to form young, 
hot igneous rocks. The heat from these rocks drives 
groundwater towards the surface. As the water cools, ions precipitate out 
as mineral crystals, including quartz crystals from silicon 
and oxygen, feldspar from potassium, aluminum, 
silicon, and oxygen, galena from lead and sulfur. Many of these crystals have signature 
shapes— take this cascade of pointed quartz, 
or this pile of galena cubes. But what causes them to grow into these
shapes again and again? Part of the answer lies in their atoms. Every crystal’s atoms are arranged 
in a highly organized, repeating pattern. This pattern is the defining 
feature of a crystal, and isn’t restricted to minerals— sand, ice, sugar, chocolate, ceramics, 
metals, DNA, and even some liquids have 
crystalline structures. Each crystalline material’s atomic 
arrangement falls into one of six different families: cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, 
monoclinic, triclinic, and hexagonal. Given the appropriate conditions, crystals will grow into geometric shapes that reflect the arrangement 
of their atoms. Take galena, which has a cubic structure 
composed of lead and sulfur atoms. The relatively large lead atoms are arranged in a three-dimensional 
grid 90 degrees from one another, while the relatively small sulfur atoms 
fit neatly between them. As the crystal grows, locations like these
attract sulfur atoms, while lead will tend to 
bond to these places. Eventually, they will complete the grid 
of bonded atoms. This means the 90 degree grid pattern 
of galena’s crystalline structure is reflected in the visible 
shape of the crystal. Quartz, meanwhile, has a hexagonal 
crystalline structure. This means that on one plane its atoms 
are arranged in hexagons. In three dimensions, these hexagons are 
composed of many interlocking pyramids made up of one silicon atom 
and four oxygen atoms. So the signature shape of a quartz 
crystal is a six-sided column with pointed tips. Depending on environmental conditions, most crystals have the potential to form

**Transcript**:
For 3 billion people around the world, seafood provides a significant source 
of protein and nutrition. But recent studies show that 33% of wild 
fisheries are overfished, while another 60% are fished at their 
maximum capacity. In fact, over half the seafood we eat– from finfish and shellfish to 
seaweed and algae– isn’t caught in the wild. It’s grown through aquaculture, 
or aquatic farming. Farmed seafood is one of the 
fastest-growing food industries, expanding in volume by 5.8% each year. But different methods of aquaculture come 
with different advantages and issues– some of which echo the serious problems 
we’ve seen in industrial agriculture. So how can we avoid repeating the mistakes
we’ve made on land, at sea? What aquaculture approaches are we 
currently using, and what does a sustainable way 
to farm the ocean really look like? One of the most common aquaculture 
methods involves large pens made of nets, where fish are farmed offshore in floating
cages roughly 1000 square meters in size. Commonly employed off the coast of Chile
and in the fjords of Norway, these fish, like many industrially 
farmed animals, occupy stressful, overcrowded pens. They produce massive amounts of waste, polluting the surrounding areas and potentially spreading diseases
to wild species. Worse still, since the antibiotics 
employed to fight disease aren’t fully absorbed by the fish, they get excreted back 
into the environment. Net pens are also susceptible to escapes, unleashing huge numbers of fish which 
compete for resources and weaken the local gene pool 
with genes adapted for captivity. Escaped fish can even disrupt local 
ecosystems as invasive species. Other techniques, such as man-made coastal ponds commonly
used for shrimp farming in Southeast Asia, create additional environmental problems. Just like net pens, these ponds are prone
to spreading pollution and disease. Their construction also frequently 
destroys important ecosystems like mangroves and marshes, which protect coastal areas from storms, provide habitats, and absorb tons 
of greenhouse gases. One way to solve these problems is to farm
fish on land in completely contained systems. Tanks and raceways can recirculate and 
filter water to prevent pollution. But even fully contained facilities still 
contend with another major hurdle: fishmeal. About 10% of the seafood caught globally
is used to feed animals, including carnivorous farmed fish. Researchers are working on fish feed made 
of insects and plant-based proteins, but for now many inland fish farms 
are connected to overfishing. All these obstacles can make sustainable 
aquaculture feel a long way off, but innovative farmers are finding new 
ways to responsibly farm the seas. The most promising solution of all 
may be to look lower on the food chain. Instead of cramming large, carnivorous 
fish into pens, we can work with natural ocean systems to produce huge amounts of shellfish 
and seaweeds. These low-maintenance flora and fauna 
don’t need to be fed at all. In fact, they naturally improve 
water quality, filtering it as they feed off of sunlight 
and nutrients in the seawater. By absorbing carbon through 
photosynthesis, these farms help battle climate change, and reduce local ocean acidification while creating habitats for other 
species to thrive. Shifting to restorative ocean farming could provide good jobs for 
coastal communities, and support healthy plant and 
shellfish-based diets that have an incredibly 
low carbon footprint. In just 5 months, 4,000 square meters of ocean can 
produce 25 tons of seaweed and 250,000 of shellfish. With the right distribution network, a series of small farms, collectively 
the size of Washington State could feed the planet. Farms like these are already popping up
around the globe, and a new generation of farmers is 
stepping up to pursue a more sustainable future. Done properly, regenerative ocean farming could play
a vital role in helping our oceans, our climate, and ourselves.

**Transcript**:
For 3 billion people around the world, seafood provides a significant source 
of protein and nutrition. But recent studies show that 33% of wild 
fisheries are overfished, while another 60% are fished at their 
maximum capacity. In fact, over half the seafood we eat– from finfish and shellfish to 
seaweed and algae– isn’t caught in the wild. It’s grown through aquaculture, 
or aquatic farming. Farmed seafood is one of the 
fastest-growing food industries, expanding in volume by 5.8% each year. But different methods of aquaculture come 
with different advantages and issues– some of which echo the serious problems 
we’ve seen in industrial agriculture. So how can we avoid repeating the mistakes
we’ve made on land, at sea? What aquaculture approaches are we 
currently using, and what does a sustainable way 
to farm the ocean really look like? One of the most common aquaculture 
methods involves large pens made of nets, where fish are farmed offshore in floating
cages roughly 1000 square meters in size. Commonly employed off the coast of Chile
and in the fjords of Norway, these fish, like many industrially 
farmed animals, occupy stressful, overcrowded pens. They produce massive amounts of waste, polluting the surrounding areas and potentially spreading diseases
to wild species. Worse still, since the antibiotics 
employed to fight disease aren’t fully absorbed by the fish, they get excreted back 
into the environment. Net pens are also susceptible to escapes, unleashing huge numbers of fish which 
compete for resources and weaken the local gene pool 
with genes adapted for captivity. Escaped fish can even disrupt local 
ecosystems as invasive species. Other techniques, such as man-made coastal ponds commonly
used for shrimp farming in Southeast Asia, create additional environmental problems. Just like net pens, these ponds are prone
to spreading pollution and disease. Their construction also frequently 
destroys important ecosystems like mangroves and marshes, which protect coastal areas from storms, provide habitats, and absorb tons 
of greenhouse gases. One way to solve these problems is to farm
fish on land in completely contained systems. Tanks and raceways can recirculate and 
filter water to prevent pollution. But even fully contained facilities still 
contend with another major hurdle: fishmeal. About 10% of the seafood caught globally
is used to feed animals, including carnivorous farmed fish. Researchers are working on fish feed made 
of insects and plant-based proteins, but for now many inland fish farms 
are connected to overfishing. All these obstacles can make sustainable 
aquaculture feel a long way off, but innovative farmers are finding new 
ways to responsibly farm the seas. The most promising solution of all 
may be to look lower on the food chain. Instead of cramming large, carnivorous 
fish into pens, we can work with natural ocean systems to produce huge amounts of shellfish 
and seaweeds. These low-maintenance flora and fauna 
don’t need to be fed at all. In fact, they naturally improve 
water quality, filtering it as they feed off of sunlight 
and nutrients in the seawater. By absorbing carbon through 
photosynthesis, these farms help battle climate change, and reduce local ocean acidification while creating habitats for other 
species to thrive. Shifting to restorative ocean farming could provide good jobs for 
coastal communities, and support healthy plant and 
shellfish-based diets that have an incredibly 
low carbon footprint. In just 5 months, 4,000 square meters of ocean can 
produce 25 tons of seaweed and 250,000 of shellfish. With the right distribution network, a series of small farms, collectively 
the size of Washington State could feed the planet. Farms like these are already popping up
around the globe, and a new generation of farmers is 
stepping up to pursue a more sustainable future. Done properly, regenerative ocean farming could play
a vital role in helping our oceans, our climate, and ourselves.

**Transcript**:
The world is getting closer to achieving one of the most important 
public health goals of our time: eradicating HIV. And to do this, we won’t even have 
to cure the disease. We simply have to stop HIV from 
being transmitted until eventually it fizzles out. Once, this goal would have 
seemed impossible. HIV has caused millions of deaths and is one of the most devastating 
diseases that humanity has ever known. But we’re now at a point where new 
advances such as one-pill, once-a-day medications are helping us tackle HIV 
in effective ways. HIV is a retrovirus– meaning it integrates copies of itself 
into an infected cell’s DNA, allowing it to replicate and 
infect other cells. HIV has evolved numerous ways to evade 
the human immune system, which makes it difficult to cure. But by developing ways to 
block HIV replication, we can stop the spread of HIV itself. That’s where antiretrovirals–
a.k.a. ARVs– come in. ARVs are a group of drugs which work 
in different ways to combat HIV. Some block HIV’s access into immune cells, and others work by stopping the 
virus itself from replicating. ARVs also work preventatively in people 
who don’t have HIV. This type of approach is called 
pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. PrEP works by accumulating in a 
person’s body and preventing HIV from 
establishing itself. That means an HIV-negative person who may
be at risk of contracting the disease can take certain ARVs 
to protect themselves, before they become exposed. Here’s where it gets 
especially interesting: In people with HIV, ARVs can also 
dramatically reduce HIV transmission. This is called “Treatment as Prevention.” On a global scale, this has the potential 
to end the HIV epidemic. It’s based on the idea that someone with
HIV who takes ARV’s can lower the virus level in their bodies
until it becomes undetectable. That doesn’t mean the virus is gone; it could still be lurking within cells, 
ready to reactivate if treatment stops. But so long as it’s kept 
dormant with drugs, HIV remains undetectable. And when HIV is undetectable, 
it’s untransmittable, too. In theory this means that by testing 
everyone who’s at risk of HIV and treating those who test positive, we could stop transmission and 
eventually eradicate HIV. In the real world, however, 
things are more complex. Many at-risk HIV negative people across 
the world do not have access to PrEP or ARVs, and those who are HIV positive may 
experience challenges to taking ARVs. These problems are often greatest in 
countries where the burden of HIV is highest. Getting these medications depends on 
access to a functioning healthcare system– and this isn’t something everyone has. That’s part of the reason why stopping 
the spread of HIV for good will require a significant investment of 
resources to improve those systems. One study carried out by the UNAIDS estimated that between 20-30 billion 
dollars per year would be needed to achieve 
a nearly 90% reduction in new HIV infections by 2030. This investment would ensure more people
would get tested in the first place, and more would be able to access and 
maintain treatment. Achieving this goal and improving 
healthcare in general is in everyone’s best interest, from individual people to 
society as a whole. We have roadmaps that could allow us to bring the HIV epidemic to an 
end in the near future, with the possibility of eradicating the 
disease altogether several generations in the future. In the period from 1996 to 2017 we almost halved the number 
of new HIV infections, and for the millions of people who still 
live with the virus, ARV treatments enable most to lead long 
and healthy lives. With continued and increased investments, we can get transmission rates low enough
to end HIV once and for all. A world without HIV is no longer 
inconceivable: it’s closer than ever.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a completely different topic, such as a teacher playing a game with students, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to HIV and health.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, but only in terms of having a True/False-like format. However, the content and intent of Question 1 are completely unrelated to the ground truth MCQ.

Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ. But if I had to provide an index, I would say -1 or "No match".

If you could provide more generated MCQs that are related to the topic of HIV and health, I would be happy to help you identify the most similar one.

**Transcript**:
The world is getting closer to achieving one of the most important 
public health goals of our time: eradicating HIV. And to do this, we won’t even have 
to cure the disease. We simply have to stop HIV from 
being transmitted until eventually it fizzles out. Once, this goal would have 
seemed impossible. HIV has caused millions of deaths and is one of the most devastating 
diseases that humanity has ever known. But we’re now at a point where new 
advances such as one-pill, once-a-day medications are helping us tackle HIV 
in effective ways. HIV is a retrovirus– meaning it integrates copies of itself 
into an infected cell’s DNA, allowing it to replicate and 
infect other cells. HIV has evolved numerous ways to evade 
the human immune system, which makes it difficult to cure. But by developing ways to 
block HIV replication, we can stop the spread of HIV itself. That’s where antiretrovirals–
a.k.a. ARVs– come in. ARVs are a group of drugs which work 
in different ways to combat HIV. Some block HIV’s access into immune cells, and others work by stopping the 
virus itself from replicating. ARVs also work preventatively in people 
who don’t have HIV. This type of approach is called 
pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. PrEP works by accumulating in a 
person’s body and preventing HIV from 
establishing itself. That means an HIV-negative person who may
be at risk of contracting the disease can take certain ARVs 
to protect themselves, before they become exposed. Here’s where it gets 
especially interesting: In people with HIV, ARVs can also 
dramatically reduce HIV transmission. This is called “Treatment as Prevention.” On a global scale, this has the potential 
to end the HIV epidemic. It’s based on the idea that someone with
HIV who takes ARV’s can lower the virus level in their bodies
until it becomes undetectable. That doesn’t mean the virus is gone; it could still be lurking within cells, 
ready to reactivate if treatment stops. But so long as it’s kept 
dormant with drugs, HIV remains undetectable. And when HIV is undetectable, 
it’s untransmittable, too. In theory this means that by testing 
everyone who’s at risk of HIV and treating those who test positive, we could stop transmission and 
eventually eradicate HIV. In the real world, however, 
things are more complex. Many at-risk HIV negative people across 
the world do not have access to PrEP or ARVs, and those who are HIV positive may 
experience challenges to taking ARVs. These problems are often greatest in 
countries where the burden of HIV is highest. Getting these medications depends on 
access to a functioning healthcare system– and this isn’t something everyone has. That’s part of the reason why stopping 
the spread of HIV for good will require a significant investment of 
resources to improve those systems. One study carried out by the UNAIDS estimated that between 20-30 billion 
dollars per year would be needed to achieve 
a nearly 90% reduction in new HIV infections by 2030. This investment would ensure more people
would get tested in the first place, and more would be able to access and 
maintain treatment. Achieving this goal and improving 
healthcare in general is in everyone’s best interest, from individual people to 
society as a whole. We have roadmaps that could allow us to bring the HIV epidemic to an 
end in the near future, with the possibility of eradicating the 
disease altogether several generations in the future. In the period from 1996 to 2017 we almost halved the number 
of new HIV infections, and for the millions of people who still 
live with the virus, ARV treatments enable most to lead long 
and healthy lives. With continued and increased investments, we can get transmission rates low enough
to end HIV once and for all. A world without HIV is no longer 
inconceivable: it’s closer than ever.

**Transcript**:
At a Maryland country fair in 2017, the prize pigs were not 
looking their best. Farmers reported feverish hogs with 
inflamed eyes and running snouts. But while fair officials worried 
about the pigs, the Maryland department of health was 
concerned about a group of sick fairgoers. Some had pet the pigs, while others had 
merely been near their barns; but soon, 40 of these attendees would 
be diagnosed with swine flu. More often than not, sick animals 
don’t infect humans. But when they do, these 
cross-species infections, or viral host jumps, have the potential to produce 
deadly epidemics. So how can pathogens from one species 
infect another, and what makes host jumps so dangerous? Viruses are a type of organic parasite 
infecting nearly all forms of life. To survive and reproduce, they must move
through three stages: contact with a susceptible host, 
infection and replication, and transmission to other individuals. As an example, let’s look 
at human influenza. First, the flu virus encounters 
a new host and makes its way into 
their respiratory tract. This isn’t so difficult, but to survive 
in this new body, the virus must mount a successful 
infection before it’s caught and broken down 
by an immune response. To accomplish this task, viruses have evolved specific interactions
with their host species. Human flu viruses are covered in proteins adapted to bind with matching receptors 
on human respiratory cells. Once inside a cell, the virus employs 
additional adaptations to hijack the host cell’s reproductive 
machinery and replicate its own genetic material. Now the virus only needs to suppress
or evade the host’s immune system long enough to replicate to sufficient 
levels and infect more cells. At this point, the flu can be passed on to
its next victim via any transmission 
of infected bodily fluid. However, this simple sneeze also brings 
the virus in contact with pets, plants, or even your lunch. Viruses are constantly encountering 
new species and attempting to infect them. More often than not, this ends in failure. In most cases, the genetic dissimilarity 
between the two hosts is too great. For a virus adapted to infect humans, a lettuce cell would be a foreign and 
inhospitable landscape. But there are a staggering number 
of viruses circulating in the environment, all with the potential to 
encounter new hosts. And because viruses rapidly reproduce 
by the millions, they can quickly develop random mutations. Most mutations will have no effect, 
or even prove detrimental; but a small proportion may enable the 
pathogen to better infect a new species. The odds of winning this destructive 
genetic lottery increase over time, or if the new species is closely related 
to the virus’ usual host. For a virus adapted to another mammal, infecting a human might just take 
a few lucky mutations. And a virus adapted to chimpanzees, one of our closest genetic relatives,
might barely require any changes at all. It takes more than time and genetic 
similarity for a host jump to be successful. Some viruses come equipped to easily 
infect a new host’s cells, but are then unable to evade 
an immune response. Others might have a difficult time 
transmitting to new hosts. For example, they might make the host’s 
blood contagious, but not their saliva. However, once a host jump reaches 
the transmission stage, the virus becomes much more dangerous. Now gestating within two hosts, the pathogen has twice the odds of 
mutating into a more successful virus. And each new host increases 
the potential for a full-blown epidemic. Virologists are constantly looking for 
mutations that might make viruses such as influenza
more likely to jump. However, predicting the next potential 
epidemic is a major challenge. There’s a huge diversity of viruses 
that we’re only just beginning to uncover. Researchers are tirelessly studying the 
biology of these pathogens. And by monitoring populations to quickly
identify new outbreaks, they can develop vaccines and containment
protocols to stop these deadly diseases.

the transmission stage, the virus becomes much more dangerous. Now gestating within two hosts, the pathogen has twice the odds of 
mutating into a more successful virus. And each new host increases 
the potential for a full-blown epidemic. Virologists are constantly looking for 
mutations that might make viruses such as influenza
more likely to jump. However, predicting the next potential 
epidemic is a major challenge. There’s a huge diversity of viruses 
that we’re only just beginning to uncover. Researchers are tirelessly studying the 
biology of these pathogens. And by monitoring populations to quickly
identify new outbreaks, they can develop vaccines and containment
protocols to stop these deadly diseases.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
15th century Europeans believed 
they had hit upon a miracle cure: a remedy for epilepsy, hemorrhage, 
bruising, nausea, and virtually any other 
medical ailment. This brown powder could be mixed 
into drinks, made into salves or eaten straight up. It was known as mumia and made 
by grinding up mummified human flesh. The word "cannibal" dates from the 
time of Christopher Columbus; in fact, Columbus may even have 
coined it himself. After coming ashore on the 
island of Guadaloupe, Columbus' initial reports back 
to the Queen of Spain described the indigenous people as 
friendly and peaceful— though he did mention rumors of a 
group called the Caribs, who made violent raids and then cooked 
and ate their prisoners. In response, Queen Isabella granted 
permission to capture and enslave anyone who ate human flesh. When the island failed to produce the gold
Columbus was looking for, he began to label anyone who resisted his 
plundering and kidnapping as a Caribe. Somewhere along the way, the word "Carib" 
became "Canibe" and then "Cannibal." First used by colonizers to dehumanize 
indigenous people, it has since been applied to anyone 
who eats human flesh. So the term comes from an account that 
wasn't based on hard evidence, but cannibalism does have a real and 
much more complex history. It has taken diverse forms— sometimes, 
as with mumia, it doesn't involved recognizable parts 
of the human body. The reasons for cannibalistic practices 
have varied, too. Across cultures and time periods, there's 
evidence of survival cannibalism, when people living through a famine, 
siege or ill-fated expedition had to either eat the bodies of the dead 
or starve to death themselves. But it's also been quite common 
for cultures to normalize some form of eating human 
flesh under ordinary circumstances. Because of false accounts 
like Columbus's, it's difficult to say exactly how common 
cultural cannibalism has been— but there are still some examples of 
accepted cannibalistic practices from within the cultures practicing them. Take the medicinal cannibalism in Europe 
during Columbus's time. Starting in the 15th century, the demand 
for mumia increased. At first, stolen mummies from Egypt 
supplied the mumia craze, but soon the demand was too great to be 
sustained on Egyptian mummies alone, and opportunists stole bodies from 
European cemeteries to turn into mumia. Use of mumia continued for 
hundreds of years. It was listed in the Merck index, 
a popular medical encyclopedia, into the 20th century. And ground up mummies were far from 
the only remedy made from human flesh that was common throughout Europe. Blood, in either liquid or powdered form, 
was used to treat epilepsy, while human liver, gall stones, oil 
distilled from human brains, and pulverized hearts were popular 
medical concoctions. In China, the written record of socially accepted 
cannibalism goes back almost 2,000 years. One particularly common 
form of cannibalism appears to have been filial cannibalism, where adult sons and daughters would 
offer a piece of their own flesh to their parents. This was typically offered as a last-ditch
attempt to cure a sick parent, and wasn't fatal to their offspring— it usually involved flesh from the thigh 
or, less often, a finger. Cannibalistic funerary rites are another 
form of culturally sanctioned cannibalism. Perhaps the best-known example came 
from the Fore people of New Guinea. Through the mid-20th century, members 
of the community would, if possible, make their funerary 
preferences known in advance, sometimes requesting that family members
gather to consume the body after death. Tragically, though these rituals 
honored the deceased, they also spread a deadly disease known 
as kuru through the community. Between the fictionalized stories, 
verifiable practices, and big gaps that still exist 
in our knowledge, there's no one history of cannibalism. But we do know that people have 
been eating each other, volunteering themselves to be eaten, and accusing others of eating 
people for millennia.

**Transcript**:
Pablo Neruda published his first 
collection of poems at age 19. He went on to win the Nobel Prize 
in Literature— and also rescue 2,000 refugees, spend three years in political exile, and run for president of Chile. A romantic and a revolutionary, Neruda was one of the most celebrated 
poets of the 20th century, but also one of the most accessible and
controversial. Originally written in Spanish, his poems often use straightforward 
language and everyday experience to create lasting impact. Neruda was born Ricardo Eliezer Neftalí
Reyes Basoalto in a small Chilean town in 1904. His father didn’t want him to be a poet, so at sixteen he began to write under 
the pen name “Pablo Neruda.” The poems in his early collection "Twenty 
Love Poems and a Song of Despair" were tender and perceptive, illuminating the subtleties 
of love and enchantment. In "Poem VI," for example, he writes: “Tu recuerdo es de luz, de humo, de 
estanque en calma!/ Más allá de tus ojos ardían 
los crepúsculos.” Later, he poured this attention to detail
into poems of appreciation for everyday objects. Many of the 225 short poems in his 
collection "All the Odes" are dedicated to the assortment of small, apparently insignificant items 
that surround us, from a pair of shoelaces to a watermelon. An onion is más hermosa que un ave/ de
plumas cegadoras, while a tuna in the market is a bala 
del profundo/ océano, proyectil natatorio, 
te vi, muerto. Despite this early literary success, Neruda struggled financially, and took a series of diplomatic jobs 
in places such as Burma, Indonesia, Singapore and Spain. In 1936, while Neruda was working at the
consulate in Madrid, civil war broke out and the government was overthrown 
by a fascist military dictatorship. Neruda organized an evacuation of 
refugees from Spain to Chile, saving 2,000 lives. Over a period of twenty years, Neruda captured his experiences abroad in
a three volume poetry collection titled "Residence on Earth." Many of these poems were experimental 
and surreal, merging epic landscapes, 
supernatural themes, and feelings of longing with discussion
of political strife and a poet’s responsibility to 
speak out against injustice. In “I Explain a Few Things” he lingers on haunting details of the 
destruction of the Spanish Civil War. For the rest of his life, Neruda remained committed to 
revolutionary ideals. His politics led to several years of exile before he was able to return 
to Chile in 1952. While in exile, he published his influential 
"Canto General." The book attempts to retell the entire 
history of Latin America through poetry, touching on everything 
from its flora and fauna to its politics and wars, but above all paying homage 
to the common people behind its civilizations’ achievements. Although he continued to travel, after returning from exile Neruda lived in Chile for the 
rest of his life. In 1970, at age 66, Neruda ran for president of Chile before
yielding to Salvador Allende and becoming his close advisor. But in 1973, Allende was overthrown in a 
military coup by General Augusto Pinochet. Neruda died in the hospital 
a couple of weeks later. Because of the timing of his death 
so soon after the coup, rumors swirled that he had died of sadness
or even been assassinated, but the hospital recorded his cause 
of death as cancer. Today, Neruda’s lines are recited at 
protests and marches worldwide. Much like his life, Neruda’s poems bridged romance and
revolution by emphasizing the everyday moments 
worth fighting for.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Neruda was the author of which Latin American classic?
Options: A. "One Hundred Years of Solitude", B. "The Aleph", C. "Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair", D. "First Dream", E. "Like Water for Chocolate"

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Pablo Neruda published his first 
collection of poems at age 19. He went on to win the Nobel Prize 
in Literature— and also rescue 2,000 refugees, spend three years in political exile, and run for president of Chile. A romantic and a revolutionary, Neruda was one of the most celebrated 
poets of the 20th century, but also one of the most accessible and
controversial. Originally written in Spanish, his poems often use straightforward 
language and everyday experience to create lasting impact. Neruda was born Ricardo Eliezer Neftalí
Reyes Basoalto in a small Chilean town in 1904. His father didn’t want him to be a poet, so at sixteen he began to write under 
the pen name “Pablo Neruda.” The poems in his early collection "Twenty 
Love Poems and a Song of Despair" were tender and perceptive, illuminating the subtleties 
of love and enchantment. In "Poem VI," for example, he writes: “Tu recuerdo es de luz, de humo, de 
estanque en calma!/ Más allá de tus ojos ardían 
los crepúsculos.” Later, he poured this attention to detail
into poems of appreciation for everyday objects. Many of the 225 short poems in his 
collection "All the Odes" are dedicated to the assortment of small, apparently insignificant items 
that surround us, from a pair of shoelaces to a watermelon. An onion is más hermosa que un ave/ de
plumas cegadoras, while a tuna in the market is a bala 
del profundo/ océano, proyectil natatorio, 
te vi, muerto. Despite this early literary success, Neruda struggled financially, and took a series of diplomatic jobs 
in places such as Burma, Indonesia, Singapore and Spain. In 1936, while Neruda was working at the
consulate in Madrid, civil war broke out and the government was overthrown 
by a fascist military dictatorship. Neruda organized an evacuation of 
refugees from Spain to Chile, saving 2,000 lives. Over a period of twenty years, Neruda captured his experiences abroad in
a three volume poetry collection titled "Residence on Earth." Many of these poems were experimental 
and surreal, merging epic landscapes, 
supernatural themes, and feelings of longing with discussion
of political strife and a poet’s responsibility to 
speak out against injustice. In “I Explain a Few Things” he lingers on haunting details of the 
destruction of the Spanish Civil War. For the rest of his life, Neruda remained committed to 
revolutionary ideals. His politics led to several years of exile before he was able to return 
to Chile in 1952. While in exile, he published his influential 
"Canto General." The book attempts to retell the entire 
history of Latin America through poetry, touching on everything 
from its flora and fauna to its politics and wars, but above all paying homage 
to the common people behind its civilizations’ achievements. Although he continued to travel, after returning from exile Neruda lived in Chile for the 
rest of his life. In 1970, at age 66, Neruda ran for president of Chile before
yielding to Salvador Allende and becoming his close advisor. But in 1973, Allende was overthrown in a 
military coup by General Augusto Pinochet. Neruda died in the hospital 
a couple of weeks later. Because of the timing of his death 
so soon after the coup, rumors swirled that he had died of sadness
or even been assassinated, but the hospital recorded his cause 
of death as cancer. Today, Neruda’s lines are recited at 
protests and marches worldwide. Much like his life, Neruda’s poems bridged romance and
revolution by emphasizing the everyday moments 
worth fighting for.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It’s an incredible discovery: an ancient, abandoned alien space station 
filled with precursor technology. But now, every species in the galaxy is 
in a mad dash to get there first and claim it for themselves. And right away, you’ve got a problem. Your ship’s faster-than-light jump drive 
consumes 1 unit of fuel for every parsec of distance it takes you, and your ship holds only 15 units of fuel. But the space station is 23 parsecs away, and there’s only empty space between 
there and here. There’s one thing that can 
help you, though: dark matter fuel is stable in deep space. That means you can vent a cache of it 
from your fuel chamber, and then come back to pick 
it up again later. Even though your ship holds 
only 15 units of fuel, you’ve been granted use of all 45 units 
in your current location. With some strategic fuel caching 
along the way, you might be able to 
make it all 23 parsecs. So how can you reach the 
alien space station? Answer in 3, 2, 1. It’s possible to solve this riddle using 
as few as two cache points, and there are also valid solutions 
that use more. No matter how you go about it though, the key is determining exactly where 
to cache fuel along your route. Let’s work backwards from the 
alien space station. To reach 23 parsecs, you’ll have to leave the 8-parsec 
mark with a full tank of fuel. The 8-parsec point is too far from the 
start to use as a cache right away; you could jump there, but wouldn’t have 
enough fuel to return to the start, let alone store any for later. So that means you’ll need to find a cache 
somewhere between the start and 8. But where? There’s an interesting pattern 
that can help. At the start you have exactly 3 tanks’ 
worth of fuel. At 8 parsecs you need exactly 1. Is there a point, which we can call 
point X, where you could have exactly 2? That would be useful, because then you 
could refuel there exactly twice, making full use of your storage capacity 
without any waste. Wherever point X is, you’ll jump forward from it twice: once to deposit some fuel at the 8-parsec 
cache point, and a second time for good. So you’ll jump the distance between X and 
8-parsecs 3 times in all. You’d have 2 tanks of fuel at point X, and
need 1 left at the 8 parsec cache point, so you can spend one tank-- or 15 units-- 
going back and forth. Since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5, we can place these two cache points 
5 parsecs apart. Any farther, and you wouldn’t have enough 
fuel to reach the alien space station. So it looks like the earliest we can place
point X is at the 3-parsec mark. Is it possible to transport 30 units of 
fuel there? Let’s try. You set out with a full tank of 15 units. You jump 3 parsecs, drop 9 units 
off at the cache point, and then jump the 3 units home, 
arriving with an empty tank. Repeating this process gets you 18 units 
of fuel at the cache point, and one more jump puts you at the 3-parsec
cache with 30 total units of fuel. So far so good! Next, you jump to the 8-parsec mark, drop off 5 units of fuel, and jump 
back to the 3-parsec mark. You fill up your tank and 
jump forward again, arriving with 10 units of 
fuel in your tank. And now the end is in sight. You beam the 5 units of fuel in from deep 
space to fill your tank to capacity, and type in the coordinates of 
your final destination. A 15-parsec jump leaves you 
running on fumes, but ready to dock with the 
precursor space station. Time to put this alien tech to work and make life better for everyone 
in the galaxy.

**Transcript**:
It’s an incredible discovery: an ancient, abandoned alien space station 
filled with precursor technology. But now, every species in the galaxy is 
in a mad dash to get there first and claim it for themselves. And right away, you’ve got a problem. Your ship’s faster-than-light jump drive 
consumes 1 unit of fuel for every parsec of distance it takes you, and your ship holds only 15 units of fuel. But the space station is 23 parsecs away, and there’s only empty space between 
there and here. There’s one thing that can 
help you, though: dark matter fuel is stable in deep space. That means you can vent a cache of it 
from your fuel chamber, and then come back to pick 
it up again later. Even though your ship holds 
only 15 units of fuel, you’ve been granted use of all 45 units 
in your current location. With some strategic fuel caching 
along the way, you might be able to 
make it all 23 parsecs. So how can you reach the 
alien space station? Answer in 3, 2, 1. It’s possible to solve this riddle using 
as few as two cache points, and there are also valid solutions 
that use more. No matter how you go about it though, the key is determining exactly where 
to cache fuel along your route. Let’s work backwards from the 
alien space station. To reach 23 parsecs, you’ll have to leave the 8-parsec 
mark with a full tank of fuel. The 8-parsec point is too far from the 
start to use as a cache right away; you could jump there, but wouldn’t have 
enough fuel to return to the start, let alone store any for later. So that means you’ll need to find a cache 
somewhere between the start and 8. But where? There’s an interesting pattern 
that can help. At the start you have exactly 3 tanks’ 
worth of fuel. At 8 parsecs you need exactly 1. Is there a point, which we can call 
point X, where you could have exactly 2? That would be useful, because then you 
could refuel there exactly twice, making full use of your storage capacity 
without any waste. Wherever point X is, you’ll jump forward from it twice: once to deposit some fuel at the 8-parsec 
cache point, and a second time for good. So you’ll jump the distance between X and 
8-parsecs 3 times in all. You’d have 2 tanks of fuel at point X, and
need 1 left at the 8 parsec cache point, so you can spend one tank-- or 15 units-- 
going back and forth. Since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5, we can place these two cache points 
5 parsecs apart. Any farther, and you wouldn’t have enough 
fuel to reach the alien space station. So it looks like the earliest we can place
point X is at the 3-parsec mark. Is it possible to transport 30 units of 
fuel there? Let’s try. You set out with a full tank of 15 units. You jump 3 parsecs, drop 9 units 
off at the cache point, and then jump the 3 units home, 
arriving with an empty tank. Repeating this process gets you 18 units 
of fuel at the cache point, and one more jump puts you at the 3-parsec
cache with 30 total units of fuel. So far so good! Next, you jump to the 8-parsec mark, drop off 5 units of fuel, and jump 
back to the 3-parsec mark. You fill up your tank and 
jump forward again, arriving with 10 units of

**Transcript**:
When Ireneo Funes looked at a glass of 
wine on a table, he saw “all the shoots, clusters, and 
grapes of the vine. He remembered the shapes of the clouds 
in the south at the dawn of the 30th of April of 1882, and he could compare them in his 
recollection with the marbled grain in the design of a leather-bound book 
which he had seen only once, and with the lines in the spray 
which an oar raised in the Rio Negro on the eve of the 
battle of the Quebrancho.” In the short story “Funes, the Memorious,” Jorge Luis Borges explores what it would 
be like to have a perfect memory. His character not only remembers 
everything he has ever seen, but every time he has seen 
it in perfect detail. These details are so overwhelming Funes has to spend his days 
in a dark room, and can only sleep by imagining a part 
of town he has never visited. According to Borges, Funes’s memories even rendered him 
incapable of real thought, because “To think is to forget a 
difference, to generalize, to abstract. In the overly replete world of Funes 
there were nothing but details.” Funes’ limitless memory was just one 
of Borges’s many explorations of infinity. Born in Argentina in 1899, he admired the revolutionaries 
of his mother’s family but took after his father’s bookish clan. His body of essays, poems, and stories, 
or, as he called them, ficciones pioneered the literary style of 
“lo real maravilloso,” known in English as Magical Realism— and each was just a few pages long. Though Borges was not interested in 
writing long books, he was an avid reader, recruiting friends to read to him 
after he went blind in middle age. He said his image of paradise was an 
infinite library, an idea he brought to life in 
“The library of Babel.” Built out of countless identical rooms, each containing the same number of 
books of the same length, the library of babel is its own universe. It contains every possible 
variation of text, so there are some profound books, but also countless tomes 
of complete gibberish. The narrator has spent his entire life wandering this vast labyrinth 
of information in a possibly futile search for meaning. Labyrinths appeared over and over 
in Borges’ work. In “The Garden of Forking Paths,” as Yu Tsun winds his way through 
country roads, he remembers a lost labyrinth 
built by one of his ancestors. Over the course of the story, he finds out the labyrinth is not a 
physical maze but a novel. And this novel reveals that the real 
Garden of Forking Paths is time: in every instant, there are infinite 
possible courses of action. And as one moment follows another, each possibility begets another 
set of divergent futures. Borges laid out infinite expanses of time
in his labyrinths, but he also explored the idea of 
condensing all of time into a single moment. In “The God’s Script,” at the very beginning of the world the god writes exactly one message into the spots of the jaguars, who then “love and reproduce without end, in caverns, in cane fields, on islands, in order that the last men 
might receive it.” The last man turns out to be a tenacious
old priest who spends years memorizing and 
deciphering the jaguar’s spots, culminating in an epiphany where he 
finally understands the god’s message. Imprisoned deep underground, he has no one to share this meaning with, and it changes nothing 
about his circumstances, but he doesn’t mind: in that one moment, he has experienced all the experience of
everyone who has ever existed. Reading Borges, you might catch
a glimpse of infinity too.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 9, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Most of the forest lives in the 
shadow of the giants that make up the highest canopy. These are the oldest trees, with hundreds of children and 
thousands of grandchildren. They check in with their neighbors, 
sharing food, supplies, and wisdom gained over their long lives. They do all this rooted in place, unable 
to speak, reach out, or move around. The secret to their success lies 
under the forest floor, where vast root systems support the 
towering trunks above. Partnering with these roots are symbiotic 
fungi called mycorrhizae. These fungi have countless branching, 
thread-like hyphae that together make up the mycelium. The mycelium spreads across a much larger 
area than the tree root system and connect the roots of different 
trees together. These connections form 
mycorrhizal networks. Through mycorrhizal networks, fungi can pass resources and signaling 
molecules between trees. We know the oldest trees have the 
largest mycorrhizal networks with the most connections to other trees, but these connections are incredibly 
complicated to trace. That’s because there are about a hundred 
species of mycorrhizal fungi– and an individual tree might be colonized 
by dozens of different fungal organisms, each of which connects to a 
unique set of other trees, which in turn each have their own unique 
set of fungal associations. To get a sense of how substances flow 
through this network, let’s zoom in on sugars, as they travel from a mature tree to a 
neighboring seedling. Sugar’s journey starts high above 
the ground, in the leaves of the tallest trees 
above the canopy. The leaves use the ample sunlight up there
to create sugars through photosynthesis. This essential fuel then travels 
through the tree to the base of the trunk in the thick sap. From there, sugar flows down to the roots. Mycorrhizal fungi encounter the 
tips of the roots and either surround or penetrate 
the outer root cells, depending on the type of fungi. Fungi cannot produce sugars, though they 
need them for fuel just like trees do. They can, however, collect nutrients from the soil much 
more efficiently than tree roots— and pass these nutrients into 
the tree roots. In general, substances flow from where they are more 
abundant to where they are less abundant, or from source to sink. That means that the sugars flow from the 
tree roots into the fungal hyphae. Once the sugars enter the fungus, they travel along the hyphae through 
pores between cells or through special hollow 
transporter hyphae. The fungus absorbs some of the sugars, but some travels on and enters 
the roots of a neighboring tree, a seedling that grows in the shade and 
has less opportunity to photosynthesize sugars. But why does fungus transport resources 
from tree to tree? This is one of the mysteries of the 
mycorrhizal networks. It makes sense for fungus to exchange soil
nutrients and sugar with a tree— both parties benefit. The fungus likely benefits in less obvious
ways from being part of a network between trees, but the exact ways 
aren’t totally clear. Maybe the fungus benefits from 
having connections with as many different trees as possible, and maximizes its connections by shuttling
molecules between trees. Or maybe plants reduce their 
contributions to fungi if the fungi don’t facilitate exchanges 
between trees. Whatever the reasons, these fungi pass an incredible amount 
of information between trees. Through the mycorrhizae, trees can tell 
when nutrients or signaling molecules are coming from a member of their 
own species or not. They can even tell when information is 
coming from a close relative like a sibling or parent. Trees can also share information 
about events like drought or insect attacks through their 
fungal networks, causing their neighbors to increase 
production of protective enzymes in anticipation of threats. The forest’s health relies on these 
intricate communications and exchanges. With everything so deeply interconnected, what impacts one species is bound 
to impact others.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2008, archeologists uncovered two 
9,000-year old skeletons. There’s no definitive way of knowing what 
killed these ancient people, but we do know their bones were infected 
by an all too familiar bacterium. The ancient Greeks knew its consumptive 
effects as phthisis; the Incans called it chaky oncay; 
and the English called it tuberculosis. Today, tuberculosis, or TB, is still one of the world’s biggest 
infectious killers, causing more deaths than malaria or 
even HIV and AIDS. But what exactly is this disease, and how 
has this pathogen persisted for so long? Typically, TB bacteria called 
mycobacterium tuberculosis, are airborne. They travel into our airways and 
infect our lungs. Here, immune cells called macrophages 
rush to the infection site, attempting to absorb and break down 
the bacterial invaders. In many cases, this response is enough 
to remove the bacteria. But in individuals with other 
medical conditions– ranging from malnutrition and HIV to 
diabetes and pregnancy –the immune response may not be 
strong enough to destroy the intruder. If so, mycobacterium tuberculosis will 
reproduce inside those macrophages, and form colonies in the 
surrounding lung tissue. As they infect more cells, the bacteria employ cell-degrading enzymes
that destroy the infected tissue, triggering chest pain, and causing 
patients to cough up blood. The damage to the lungs leads to 
oxygen deprivation. This begins a flood of hormonal changes– including a decrease in appetite and 
iron production. From here, microbes can spread to the 
skeletal system, causing back pain and difficulty moving; to the kidneys and intestines, 
causing abdominal pain; and to the brain, causing headaches 
and even impaired consciousness. These symptoms produce the 
classic image of TB: weight loss, a hacking, bloody cough, 
and ashen skin. This ghostly appearance earned TB 
the title of the ‘White Plague’ in Victorian-era England. During this period, tuberculosis was 
considered a ‘romantic disease,' because it tended to affect poverty-
stricken artists and poets– those with weaker immune systems. TB’s outward symptoms even helped 
fuel the popular myth of vampirism. In spite of– or perhaps because of 
these less than scientific concerns, this period also marked the first strides 
toward curing TB. In 1882, the German physician Robert Koch identified the disease’s 
bacterial origins. 13 years later, physicist Wilhelm 
Roentgen  discovered the X-ray, enabling physicians to diagnose and track 
its progression through the body. These techniques allowed researchers to 
develop reliable and effective vaccines– first for smallpox, and again in 1921, when scientists developed the BCG 
vaccine to battle TB. These developments laid the groundwork 
for the modern field of antibiotics– currently home to our most effective 
TB treatments. But, antibiotics fail to address a major 
diagnostic complication: about 90% of people infected with TB 
don’t show any symptoms. In these latent infections, the TB 
bacterium may be dormant, only activating when someone’s immune 
system is too weak to mount a defense. This makes TB much harder to diagnose. And even when properly identified, traditional treatments can take 
up to 9 months, requiring multiple drugs and a high 
potential for side effects. This discourages people from finishing 
the full course, and partial treatment enables bacteria to 
develop resistance to these drugs. Today, the disease is still prevalent 
in 30 countries, most of which face other health crises that exacerbate TB and 
trigger latent cases. Worse still, accessing treatment can 
be difficult in many of these countries, and the stigma towards TB can discourage 
people from getting the help they need. Health experts agree we need to 
develop better diagnostics, faster acting antibiotics, and more 
effective vaccines. Researchers have already developed a urine
test that yields results in 12 hours, as well as a new oral treatment that could
cut treatment time by 75%. Hopefully, with advancements like these, we’ll finally be able to make TB 
exclusively a thing of the past.

skeletal system, causing back pain and difficulty moving; to the kidneys and intestines, 
causing abdominal pain; and to the brain, causing headaches

Roentgen  discovered the X-ray, enabling physicians to diagnose and track 
its progression through the body. These techniques allowed researchers to 
develop reliable and effective vaccines– first for smallpox, and again in 1921, when scientists developed the BCG 
vaccine to battle TB. These developments laid the groundwork 
for the modern field of antibiotics– currently home to our most effective 
TB treatments. But, antibiotics fail to address a major 
diagnostic complication: about 90% of people infected with TB 
don’t show any symptoms. In these latent infections, the TB 
bacterium may be dormant, only activating when someone’s immune 
system is too weak to mount a defense. This makes TB much harder to diagnose. And even when properly identified, traditional treatments can take 
up to 9 months, requiring multiple drugs and a high 
potential for side effects. This discourages people from finishing 
the full course, and partial treatment enables bacteria to 
develop resistance to these drugs. Today, the disease is still prevalent 
in 30 countries, most of which face other health crises that exacerbate TB and 
trigger latent cases. Worse still, accessing treatment can 
be difficult in many of these countries, and the stigma towards TB can discourage 
people from getting the help they need. Health experts agree we need to 
develop better diagnostics, faster acting antibiotics, and more 
effective vaccines. Researchers have already developed a urine
test that yields results in 12 hours, as well as a new oral treatment that could
cut treatment time by 75%. Hopefully, with advancements like these, we’ll finally be able to make TB 
exclusively a thing of the past.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Deep in our solar system, a new era of space exploration
is unfolding. Beneath the thick ice of Europa, in the vapor plumes on Enceladus, and within the methane lakes of Titan, astrobiologists are on the hunt 
for extraterrestrial life. We’ve honed in on these three moons 
because each is an ‘ocean world,’ an environment that contains 
a liquid ocean– and liquid can support 
the formation of life. Living organisms have to be able to grow, 
reproduce, and feed themselves, among other things. All of those functions require the 
formation of complex molecules from more basic components. Liquids such as water allow chemical 
compounds to remain in suspension instead of sinking under 
the force of gravity. This enables them to interact frequently
in a 3-dimensional space and, in the right conditions, go through chemical reactions that 
lead to the formation of living matter. That alone isn’t enough; the small but complex biomolecules 
that we’re familiar with are sensitive to temperature— too hot or cold, and they won’t mix. Liquid water has an additional advantage in that it’s relatively 
temperature-stable, meaning it can insulate molecules against
large shifts in heat. On Earth, these and other conditions in 
aquatic environments may have supported the emergence 
of life billions of years ago. Tantalizingly, the same could be true
in other parts of our solar system, like these three icy moons. Europa, which is a moon of Jupiter, is probably the most 
intriguing ocean world. Beneath a surface layer of ice thicker 
than Mount Everest, there exists a liquid ocean as much as
100 kilometers deep. Astrobiologists think this hidden 
ocean could harbor life. Thanks to the Galileo probe, we can deduce that its 
potential salt content is similar to that of some lakes on Earth. But most of its characteristics will be a 
mystery until we can explore it further. Like Jupiter, Saturn also has moons that 
might have the right conditions for life. For instance– Enceladus is a tiny ball of 
ice that’s small enough to nestle within the surface area 
of the Gulf of Mexico. Similarly to Europa, it likely contains an
ocean deep under the ice. But Enceladus also has geysers that frequently vent water vapor and 
tiny ice grains into space. Astrobiologists are curious about whether
these geysers are connected to the ocean below. They hope to send a probe to test whether
the geysers’ plumes of vapor contain life-enabling material
from that hidden sea. Although it’s the best known substance 
for nurturing life, water isn’t necessarily the only medium
that can support living things. Take Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, which has a thick nitrogen atmosphere containing methane and many other 
organic molecules. Its clouds condense and 
rain onto Titan’s surface, sustaining lakes and seas 
full of liquid methane. This compound’s particular chemistry means
it’s not as supportive a medium as water. But, paired with the high quantities 
of organic material that also rain down from the sky, these bodies of liquid methane could
possibly support unfamiliar life forms. So what might indicate that life exists on
these or other worlds? If it is out there, astrobiologists 
speculate that it would be microscopic, comparable to the bacteria 
we have on earth. This would make it difficult to directly 
observe from a great distance, so astrobiologists seek clues 
called biosignatures. Those may be cells, fossils, or mineral 
traces left behind by living things. And finding any biosignatures will be 
challenging for many reasons. One of the biggest concerns is to make sure we sterilize our 
probes extremely thoroughly. Otherwise we could accidentally 
contaminate ocean worlds with Earth’s own bacteria, which could destroy alien life. Titan, Enceladus, and Europa are just three of possibly many 
ocean worlds that we could explore. We already know of several other 
candidates in our solar system, including Jupiter’s moons Callisto and 
Ganymede, Neptune’s Triton, and even Pluto. If there’s this much potential for life
to exist in our own tiny solar system, what unimagined secrets might the 
rest of the universe contain?

challenging for many reasons. One of the biggest concerns is to make sure we sterilize our 
probes extremely thoroughly. Otherwise we could accidentally 
contaminate ocean worlds with Earth’s own bacteria, which could destroy alien life. Titan, Enceladus, and Europa are just three of possibly many 
ocean worlds that we could explore. We already know of several other 
candidates in our solar system, including Jupiter’s moons Callisto and 
Ganymede, Neptune’s Triton, and even Pluto. If there’s this much potential for life
to exist in our own tiny solar system, what unimagined secrets might the 
rest of the universe contain?

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Deep beneath the geysers and hot springs 
of Yellowstone Caldera lies a magma chamber produced by a 
hot spot in the earth’s mantle. As the magma moves towards 
the Earth’s surface, it crystallizes to form young, 
hot igneous rocks. The heat from these rocks drives 
groundwater towards the surface. As the water cools, ions precipitate out 
as mineral crystals, including quartz crystals from silicon 
and oxygen, feldspar from potassium, aluminum, 
silicon, and oxygen, galena from lead and sulfur. Many of these crystals have signature 
shapes— take this cascade of pointed quartz, 
or this pile of galena cubes. But what causes them to grow into these
shapes again and again? Part of the answer lies in their atoms. Every crystal’s atoms are arranged 
in a highly organized, repeating pattern. This pattern is the defining 
feature of a crystal, and isn’t restricted to minerals— sand, ice, sugar, chocolate, ceramics, 
metals, DNA, and even some liquids have 
crystalline structures. Each crystalline material’s atomic 
arrangement falls into one of six different families: cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, 
monoclinic, triclinic, and hexagonal. Given the appropriate conditions, crystals will grow into geometric shapes that reflect the arrangement 
of their atoms. Take galena, which has a cubic structure 
composed of lead and sulfur atoms. The relatively large lead atoms are arranged in a three-dimensional 
grid 90 degrees from one another, while the relatively small sulfur atoms 
fit neatly between them. As the crystal grows, locations like these
attract sulfur atoms, while lead will tend to 
bond to these places. Eventually, they will complete the grid 
of bonded atoms. This means the 90 degree grid pattern 
of galena’s crystalline structure is reflected in the visible 
shape of the crystal. Quartz, meanwhile, has a hexagonal 
crystalline structure. This means that on one plane its atoms 
are arranged in hexagons. In three dimensions, these hexagons are 
composed of many interlocking pyramids made up of one silicon atom 
and four oxygen atoms. So the signature shape of a quartz 
crystal is a six-sided column with pointed tips. Depending on environmental conditions, most crystals have the potential to form
multiple geometric shapes. For example, diamonds, which form deep
in the Earth’s mantle, have a cubic crystalline structure and can
grow into either cubes or octahedrons. Which shape a particular 
diamond grows into depends on the conditions where it grows, including pressure, temperature, 
and chemical environment. While we can’t directly observe growth 
conditions in the mantle, laboratory experiments have shown some
evidence that diamonds tend to grow into cubes at 
lower temperatures and octahedrons at higher temperatures. Trace amounts of water, silicon, 
germanium, or magnesium might also influence a diamond’s shape. And diamonds never naturally grow into the
shapes found in jewelry— those diamonds have been cut to 
showcase sparkle and clarity. Environmental conditions can also 
influence whether crystals form at all. Glass is made of melted quartz sand, but it isn’t crystalline. That’s because glass cools 
relatively quickly, and the atoms do not have time to arrange
themselves into the ordered structure 
of a quartz crystal. Instead, the random arrangement 
of the atoms in the melted glass is locked in upon cooling. Many crystals don’t form geometric shapes because they grow in extremely close 
quarters with other crystals. Rocks like granite are full of crystals, but none have recognizable shapes. As magma cools and solidifies, many minerals within it crystallize at the
same time and quickly run out of space. And certain crystals, like turquoise, don’t grow into any discernible geometric
shape in most environmental conditions, even given adequate space. Every crystal’s atomic structure has 
unique properties, and while these properties may not have
any bearing on human emotional needs, they do have powerful applications 
in materials science and medicine.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
For 3 billion people around the world, seafood provides a significant source 
of protein and nutrition. But recent studies show that 33% of wild 
fisheries are overfished, while another 60% are fished at their 
maximum capacity. In fact, over half the seafood we eat– from finfish and shellfish to 
seaweed and algae– isn’t caught in the wild. It’s grown through aquaculture, 
or aquatic farming. Farmed seafood is one of the 
fastest-growing food industries, expanding in volume by 5.8% each year. But different methods of aquaculture come 
with different advantages and issues– some of which echo the serious problems 
we’ve seen in industrial agriculture. So how can we avoid repeating the mistakes
we’ve made on land, at sea? What aquaculture approaches are we 
currently using, and what does a sustainable way 
to farm the ocean really look like? One of the most common aquaculture 
methods involves large pens made of nets, where fish are farmed offshore in floating
cages roughly 1000 square meters in size. Commonly employed off the coast of Chile
and in the fjords of Norway, these fish, like many industrially 
farmed animals, occupy stressful, overcrowded pens. They produce massive amounts of waste, polluting the surrounding areas and potentially spreading diseases
to wild species. Worse still, since the antibiotics 
employed to fight disease aren’t fully absorbed by the fish, they get excreted back 
into the environment. Net pens are also susceptible to escapes, unleashing huge numbers of fish which 
compete for resources and weaken the local gene pool 
with genes adapted for captivity. Escaped fish can even disrupt local 
ecosystems as invasive species. Other techniques, such as man-made coastal ponds commonly
used for shrimp farming in Southeast Asia, create additional environmental problems. Just like net pens, these ponds are prone
to spreading pollution and disease. Their construction also frequently 
destroys important ecosystems like mangroves and marshes, which protect coastal areas from storms, provide habitats, and absorb tons 
of greenhouse gases. One way to solve these problems is to farm
fish on land in completely contained systems. Tanks and raceways can recirculate and 
filter water to prevent pollution. But even fully contained facilities still 
contend with another major hurdle: fishmeal. About 10% of the seafood caught globally
is used to feed animals, including carnivorous farmed fish. Researchers are working on fish feed made 
of insects and plant-based proteins, but for now many inland fish farms 
are connected to overfishing. All these obstacles can make sustainable 
aquaculture feel a long way off, but innovative farmers are finding new 
ways to responsibly farm the seas. The most promising solution of all 
may be to look lower on the food chain. Instead of cramming large, carnivorous 
fish into pens, we can work with natural ocean systems to produce huge amounts of shellfish 
and seaweeds. These low-maintenance flora and fauna 
don’t need to be fed at all. In fact, they naturally improve 
water quality, filtering it as they feed off of sunlight 
and nutrients in the seawater. By absorbing carbon through 
photosynthesis, these farms help battle climate change, and reduce local ocean acidification while creating habitats for other 
species to thrive. Shifting to restorative ocean farming could provide good jobs for 
coastal communities, and support healthy plant and 
shellfish-based diets that have an incredibly 
low carbon footprint. In just 5 months, 4,000 square meters of ocean can 
produce 25 tons of seaweed and 250,000 of shellfish. With the right distribution network, a series of small farms, collectively 
the size of Washington State could feed the planet. Farms like these are already popping up
around the globe, and a new generation of farmers is 
stepping up to pursue a more sustainable future. Done properly, regenerative ocean farming could play
a vital role in helping our oceans, our climate, and ourselves.

**Transcript**:
The world is getting closer to achieving one of the most important 
public health goals of our time: eradicating HIV. And to do this, we won’t even have 
to cure the disease. We simply have to stop HIV from 
being transmitted until eventually it fizzles out. Once, this goal would have 
seemed impossible. HIV has caused millions of deaths and is one of the most devastating 
diseases that humanity has ever known. But we’re now at a point where new 
advances such as one-pill, once-a-day medications are helping us tackle HIV 
in effective ways. HIV is a retrovirus– meaning it integrates copies of itself 
into an infected cell’s DNA, allowing it to replicate and 
infect other cells. HIV has evolved numerous ways to evade 
the human immune system, which makes it difficult to cure. But by developing ways to 
block HIV replication, we can stop the spread of HIV itself. That’s where antiretrovirals–
a.k.a. ARVs– come in. ARVs are a group of drugs which work 
in different ways to combat HIV. Some block HIV’s access into immune cells, and others work by stopping the 
virus itself from replicating. ARVs also work preventatively in people 
who don’t have HIV. This type of approach is called 
pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. PrEP works by accumulating in a 
person’s body and preventing HIV from 
establishing itself. That means an HIV-negative person who may
be at risk of contracting the disease can take certain ARVs 
to protect themselves, before they become exposed. Here’s where it gets 
especially interesting: In people with HIV, ARVs can also 
dramatically reduce HIV transmission. This is called “Treatment as Prevention.” On a global scale, this has the potential 
to end the HIV epidemic. It’s based on the idea that someone with
HIV who takes ARV’s can lower the virus level in their bodies
until it becomes undetectable. That doesn’t mean the virus is gone; it could still be lurking within cells, 
ready to reactivate if treatment stops. But so long as it’s kept 
dormant with drugs, HIV remains undetectable. And when HIV is undetectable, 
it’s untransmittable, too. In theory this means that by testing 
everyone who’s at risk of HIV and treating those who test positive, we could stop transmission and 
eventually eradicate HIV. In the real world, however, 
things are more complex. Many at-risk HIV negative people across 
the world do not have access to PrEP or ARVs, and those who are HIV positive may 
experience challenges to taking ARVs. These problems are often greatest in 
countries where the burden of HIV is highest. Getting these medications depends on 
access to a functioning healthcare system– and this isn’t something everyone has. That’s part of the reason why stopping 
the spread of HIV for good will require a significant investment of 
resources to improve those systems. One study carried out by the UNAIDS estimated that between 20-30 billion 
dollars per year would be needed to achieve 
a nearly 90% reduction in new HIV infections by 2030. This investment would ensure more people
would get tested in the first place, and more would be able to access and 
maintain treatment. Achieving this goal and improving 
healthcare in general is in everyone’s best interest, from individual people to 
society as a whole. We have roadmaps that could allow us to bring the HIV epidemic to an 
end in the near future, with the possibility of eradicating the 
disease altogether several generations in the future. In the period from 1996 to 2017 we almost halved the number 
of new HIV infections, and for the millions of people who still 
live with the virus, ARV treatments enable most to lead long 
and healthy lives. With continued and increased investments, we can get transmission rates low enough
to end HIV once and for all. A world without HIV is no longer 
inconceivable: it’s closer than ever.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 17, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The world is getting closer to achieving one of the most important 
public health goals of our time: eradicating HIV. And to do this, we won’t even have 
to cure the disease. We simply have to stop HIV from 
being transmitted until eventually it fizzles out. Once, this goal would have 
seemed impossible. HIV has caused millions of deaths and is one of the most devastating 
diseases that humanity has ever known. But we’re now at a point where new 
advances such as one-pill, once-a-day medications are helping us tackle HIV 
in effective ways. HIV is a retrovirus– meaning it integrates copies of itself 
into an infected cell’s DNA, allowing it to replicate and 
infect other cells. HIV has evolved numerous ways to evade 
the human immune system, which makes it difficult to cure. But by developing ways to 
block HIV replication, we can stop the spread of HIV itself. That’s where antiretrovirals–
a.k.a. ARVs– come in. ARVs are a group of drugs which work 
in different ways to combat HIV. Some block HIV’s access into immune cells, and others work by stopping the 
virus itself from replicating. ARVs also work preventatively in people 
who don’t have HIV. This type of approach is called 
pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. PrEP works by accumulating in a 
person’s body and preventing HIV from 
establishing itself. That means an HIV-negative person who may
be at risk of contracting the disease can take certain ARVs 
to protect themselves, before they become exposed. Here’s where it gets 
especially interesting: In people with HIV, ARVs can also 
dramatically reduce HIV transmission. This is called “Treatment as Prevention.” On a global scale, this has the potential 
to end the HIV epidemic. It’s based on the idea that someone with
HIV who takes ARV’s can lower the virus level in their bodies
until it becomes undetectable. That doesn’t mean the virus is gone; it could still be lurking within cells, 
ready to reactivate if treatment stops. But so long as it’s kept 
dormant with drugs, HIV remains undetectable. And when HIV is undetectable, 
it’s untransmittable, too. In theory this means that by testing
