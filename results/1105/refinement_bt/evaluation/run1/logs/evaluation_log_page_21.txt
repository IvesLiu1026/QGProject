**Transcript**:
This syringe contains a radioactive form 
of glucose known as FDG. The doctor will soon inject its contents 
into her patient’s arm, whom she’s testing for cancer 
using a PET scanner. The FDG will quickly circulate 
through his body. If he has a tumor, cancer cells within it will take up a 
significant portion of the FDG, which will act as a beacon 
for the scanner. PET tracers such as FDG are among the most remarkable tools 
in medical diagnostics, and their life begins in 
a particle accelerator, just hours earlier. The particle accelerator in question 
is called a cyclotron, and it’s often housed in a bunker 
within hospitals. It uses electromagnetic fields to propel 
charged particles like protons faster and faster 
along a spiraling path. When the protons reach 
their maximum speed, they shoot out onto a target that contains
a few milliliters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen 
called oxygen-18. When a proton slams into one of these 
heavier oxygen atoms, it kicks out another subatomic particle 
called a neutron. This impact turns oxygen-18 
into fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that can be 
detected on a PET scan. In a little under two hours, about half the fluorine will be gone 
due to radioactive decay, so the clock is ticking 
to get the scan done. So how can fluorine-18 be 
used to detect diseases? Radiochemists at the hospital can use 
a series of chemical reactions to attach the radioactive fluorine 
to different molecules, creating radiotracers. The identity of the tracer depends on what
doctors want to observe. FDG is a common one because the rate at 
which cells consume glucose can signal the presence of cancer; the location of an infection; or the slowing brain function of dementia. The FDG is now ready for 
the patient’s scan. When a radiolabeled tracer 
enters the body, it travels through the circulatory system 
and gets taken up by its target— whether that's a protein in the brain,
cancer cells, or otherwise. Within a few minutes, a significant amount of the tracer has 
found its way to the target area and the rest has cleared from circulation. Now the doctors can see 
their target using a PET, or positron emission tomography, scanner. The radiation that the tracer emits 
is what makes this possible. The isotopes used in PET decay 
by positron emission. Positrons are essentially electrons 
with positive charge. When emitted, a positron collides 
with an electron from another molecule in its surroundings. This causes a tiny nuclear reaction in which the mass of the two particles is 
converted into two high-energy photons, similar to X-rays, that shoot out in opposite directions. These photons will then impact an array of paired radiation detectors 
in the scanner walls. The software in the scanner 
uses those detectors to estimate where inside the body 
the collision occurred and create a 3D map of the 
tracer’s distribution. PET scans can detect the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with 
other types of imaging. They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis
of Alzheimer’s disease by allowing doctors to see amyloid, the telltale protein buildup that 
otherwise couldn’t be confirmed without an autopsy. Meanwhile, researchers are actively 
working to develop new tracers and expand the possibilities of what 
PET scans can be used for. But with all this talk of radiation and
nuclear reactions inside the body, are these scans safe? Even though no amount of ionizing 
radiation is completely safe, the amount of radiation the body receives
during a PET scan is actually quite low. One scan is comparable to what you’re 
exposed to over two or three years from natural radioactive sources, 
like radon gas; or the amount a pilot would rack up from cosmic radiation after 
20 to 30 transatlantic flights. Most patients feel that those risks 
are acceptable for the chance to diagnose 
and treat their illnesses.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar generated MCQ.

Although Question 4 does not ask about the duration of fluorine-18, it does mention the cyclotron, which is the device used to produce fluorine-18. However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly address the duration of fluorine-18.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar generated MCQ, but I would like to emphasize that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
This syringe contains a radioactive form 
of glucose known as FDG. The doctor will soon inject its contents 
into her patient’s arm, whom she’s testing for cancer 
using a PET scanner. The FDG will quickly circulate 
through his body. If he has a tumor, cancer cells within it will take up a 
significant portion of the FDG, which will act as a beacon 
for the scanner. PET tracers such as FDG are among the most remarkable tools 
in medical diagnostics, and their life begins in 
a particle accelerator, just hours earlier. The particle accelerator in question 
is called a cyclotron, and it’s often housed in a bunker 
within hospitals. It uses electromagnetic fields to propel 
charged particles like protons faster and faster 
along a spiraling path. When the protons reach 
their maximum speed, they shoot out onto a target that contains
a few milliliters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen 
called oxygen-18. When a proton slams into one of these 
heavier oxygen atoms, it kicks out another subatomic particle 
called a neutron. This impact turns oxygen-18 
into fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that can be 
detected on a PET scan. In a little under two hours, about half the fluorine will be gone 
due to radioactive decay, so the clock is ticking 
to get the scan done. So how can fluorine-18 be 
used to detect diseases? Radiochemists at the hospital can use 
a series of chemical reactions to attach the radioactive fluorine 
to different molecules, creating radiotracers. The identity of the tracer depends on what
doctors want to observe. FDG is a common one because the rate at 
which cells consume glucose can signal the presence of cancer; the location of an infection; or the slowing brain function of dementia. The FDG is now ready for 
the patient’s scan. When a radiolabeled tracer 
enters the body, it travels through the circulatory system 
and gets taken up by its target— whether that's a protein in the brain,
cancer cells, or otherwise. Within a few minutes, a significant amount of the tracer has 
found its way to the target area and the rest has cleared from circulation. Now the doctors can see 
their target using a PET, or positron emission tomography, scanner. The radiation that the tracer emits 
is what makes this possible. The isotopes used in PET decay 
by positron emission. Positrons are essentially electrons 
with positive charge. When emitted, a positron collides 
with an electron from another molecule in its surroundings. This causes a tiny nuclear reaction in which the mass of the two particles is 
converted into two high-energy photons, similar to X-rays, that shoot out in opposite directions. These photons will then impact an array of paired radiation detectors 
in the scanner walls. The software in the scanner 
uses those detectors to estimate where inside the body 
the collision occurred and create a 3D map of the 
tracer’s distribution. PET scans can detect the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with 
other types of imaging. They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis
of Alzheimer’s disease by allowing doctors to see amyloid, the telltale protein buildup that 
otherwise couldn’t be confirmed without an autopsy. Meanwhile, researchers are actively 
working to develop new tracers and expand the possibilities of what 
PET scans can be used for. But with all this talk of radiation and
nuclear reactions inside the body, are these scans safe? Even though no amount of ionizing 
radiation is completely safe, the amount of radiation the body receives
during a PET scan is actually quite low. One scan is comparable to what you’re 
exposed to over two or three years from natural radioactive sources, 
like radon gas; or the amount a pilot would rack up from cosmic radiation after 
20 to 30 transatlantic flights. Most patients feel that those risks 
are acceptable for the chance to diagnose 
and treat their illnesses.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the spatial resolution of PET imaging, which is not directly addressed by any of the generated MCQs. However, Question 2 of the generated MCQs mentions the ability of PET scans to "visualize the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with other types of imaging", which implies a certain level of spatial resolution.

Although not a perfect match, I would suggest that Question 2 is the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ, based on the fact that it mentions the visualization capabilities of PET scans, which is related to the concept of spatial resolution.

**Transcript**:
A shooting star crashes on Earth, and a hideous blob emerges. It creeps and leaps, it glides and slides. It’s also unstoppable: weapons, fire, extreme temperatures… no matter what you throw at it, it just regrows and continues its rampage. Its expansion is breathtaking; it doubles in size every hour. But there’s one opportunity: after each hour, it goes to sleep, forming itself into a flat triangle and resting for a few minutes before it begins eating and growing again. Your only chance to save the planet involves a satellite-mounted nano-fission
ray that can cut through the blob. When the blog is active it heals itself within seconds. However, when you break the sleeping 
blob into two triangles, you make a critical discovery. The acute triangle portion, with all angles less than 90 degrees, 
is inert. It never “wakes up.” The obtuse triangle, which has an angle greater 
than 90 degrees, wakes up as usual and keeps growing. Similar experiments show that all shapes 
other than acute triangles, including right triangles, 
will also wake up. For the next few minutes, the blob is sleeping in its 
obtuse triangle form. You can make clean, straight-line cuts between any two points 
on or inside the triangle. But you’ll only have time to make 
7 cuts while the satellite is above you. By the time it completes 
its orbit and returns, the blob will have consumed 
the entire world, if even a single portion that 
will wake up remains. How can you cut the blob entirely 
into acute triangles and stop it from destroying the planet? Pause the video now 
to figure out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 While this seems doable at first, there’s a hidden difficulty when it comes
to avoiding obtuse and right angles. Every time you make a cut that 
reaches an edge, it either makes an acute and 
an obtuse angle, or two right angles. That makes it seems like you’re doomed
to keep creating obtuse angles. But as with so many of life’s problems, we can look to pizza for inspiration. Imagine squaring off the 
outside of a pizza, so that instead of a circle, 
it’s an octagon. When we cut it into slices, each of the eight triangles is acute. This works with larger polygons too. Importantly, it also works for some 
polygons with fewer sides, including heptagons, hexagons, 
and pentagons. That’s good news, because if you cut off the sharp corners 
of the blob triangle, a pentagon is exactly what 
you’ll be left with. And just like a pizza, you can cut the blob pentagon 
into five acute triangles. That’s 7 cuts, and it renders the 
blob completely inert. You’ve saved the day! Now you just need to figure out what to do with all of these giant, practically 
indestructible triangles.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly stated in the options. However, Question 9 is the closest match in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the danger posed by the blob, and the correct answer is that it eats everything in sight. Question 9 asks about the consequences of not rendering the blob completely inert, and the correct answer is that it would regenerate and become active, implying that it would continue to pose a threat to the planet.

Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to the threat posed by the blob and the importance of stopping it. Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 9.

other than acute triangles, including right triangles, 
will also wake up. For the next few minutes, the blob is sleeping in its 
obtuse triangle form. You can make clean, straight-line cuts between any two points 
on or inside the triangle. But you’ll only have time to make 
7 cuts while the satellite is above you. By the time it completes 
its orbit and returns, the blob will have consumed 
the entire world, if even a single portion that 
will wake up remains. How can you cut the blob entirely 
into acute triangles and stop it from destroying the planet? Pause the video now 
to figure out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 While this seems doable at first, there’s a hidden difficulty when it comes
to avoiding obtuse and right angles. Every time you make a cut that 
reaches an edge, it either makes an acute and 
an obtuse angle, or two right angles. That makes it seems like you’re doomed
to keep creating obtuse angles. But as with so many of life’s problems, we can look to pizza for inspiration. Imagine squaring off the 
outside of a pizza, so that instead of a circle, 
it’s an octagon. When we cut it into slices, each of the eight triangles is acute. This works with larger polygons too. Importantly, it also works for some 
polygons with fewer sides, including heptagons, hexagons, 
and pentagons. That’s good news, because if you cut off the sharp corners 
of the blob triangle, a pentagon is exactly what 
you’ll be left with. And just like a pizza, you can cut the blob pentagon 
into five acute triangles. That’s 7 cuts, and it renders the 
blob completely inert. You’ve saved the day! Now you just need to figure out what to do with all of these giant, practically 
indestructible triangles.

**Transcript**:
A shooting star crashes on Earth, and a hideous blob emerges. It creeps and leaps, it glides and slides. It’s also unstoppable: weapons, fire, extreme temperatures… no matter what you throw at it, it just regrows and continues its rampage. Its expansion is breathtaking; it doubles in size every hour. But there’s one opportunity: after each hour, it goes to sleep, forming itself into a flat triangle and resting for a few minutes before it begins eating and growing again. Your only chance to save the planet involves a satellite-mounted nano-fission

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest that Question 4 is the closest match.

Question 4: What is the key challenge when trying to cut the blob into acute triangles? 
Options: A. It's too hard to make straight-line cuts, B. It's too difficult to make clean cuts, C. Every cut creates obtuse or right angles, which will wake up and continue growing, D. It's too slow 
Correct Option: C

Although this question does not directly ask about the nature of the cuts, the correct option (C) implies that the cuts must be made in such a way that they do not create obtuse or right angles, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's focus on the type of cuts allowed.

However, if I had to choose a question that directly addresses the nature of the cuts, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one, I would suggest Question 6, which mentions the minimum number of cuts required to render the blob inert, but it does not specify the nature of the cuts.

But since it is mentioned in the transcript that "You can make clean, straight-line cuts between any two points on or inside the triangle.", I would suggest creating a new question based on this information.

If I had to choose an index from the provided options, I would say that the closest match is not present, but if I had to pick one, I would say it is Question 4 (index 4), with the caveat that it does not directly address the nature of the cuts.

Index: 4 (with the above-mentioned caveat)

**Transcript**:
Reaching heights of over 100 meters, Californian sequoias tower over Earth’s 
other estimated 60,000 tree species. Growing in the misty Sierra Nevada 
mountains, their massive trunks support the 
tallest known trees in the world. But even these behemoths seem 
to have their limits. No sequoia on record has been able 
to grow taller than 130 meters – and many researchers say these 
trees won’t beat that cap even if they live for thousands of 
years to come. So what exactly is stopping these trees 
from growing taller, forever? It all comes down to sap. In order for trees to grow, they need to bring sugars obtained 
from photosynthesis and nutrients brought in through the root 
system to wherever growth is happening. And just like blood circulates in 
the human body, trees are designed to circulate two kinds 
of sap throughout their bodies – carrying all the substances a 
tree’s cells need to live. The first is phloem sap. Containing the sugars generated in 
leaves during photosynthesis, phloem sap is thick, like honey, and flows down the plant’s phloem tissue 
to distribute sugar throughout the tree. By the end of its journey, the phloem sap has thinned 
into a watery substance, pooling at the base of the tree. Right beside the phloem is the tree’s 
other tissue type: the xylem. This tissue is packed with nutrients and 
ions like calcium, potassium, and iron, which the tree has absorbed 
through its roots. Here at the tree’s base, there are more of these particles in 
one tissue than the other, so the water from the phloem sap is 
absorbed into the xylem to correct the balance. This process, called osmotic movement, creates nutrient-rich xylem sap, which will then travel up the trunk to 
spread those nutrients through the tree. But this journey faces a formidable 
obstacle: gravity. To accomplish this herculean task, 
the xylem relies on three forces: transpiration, capillary action, 
and root pressure. As part of photosynthesis, leaves open 
and close pores called stomata. These openings allow oxygen and carbon 
dioxide in and out of the leaf, but they also create an opening through 
which water evaporates. This evaporation, called transpiration, creates negative pressure in the xylem, 
pulling watery xylem sap up the tree. This pull is aided by a fundamental 
property of water called capillary action. In narrow tubes, the attraction between water molecules and the adhesive forces between the water 
and its environment can beat out gravity. This capillary motion is in full effect 
in xylem filaments thinner than human hair. And where these two forces pull the sap, the osmotic movement at the tree’s 
base creates root pressure, pushing fresh xylem sap up the trunk. Together these forces launch sap 
to dizzying heights, distributing nutrients, and growing new 
leaves to photosynthesize – far above the tree’s roots. But despite these sophisticated systems, every centimeter is a fight 
against gravity. As trees grow taller and taller, the supply of these vital fluids 
begins to dwindle. At a certain height, trees can no longer afford the lost water 
that evaporates during photosynthesis. And without the photosynthesis needed 
to support additional growth, the tree instead turns its resources 
towards existing branches. This model, known as the “hydraulic 
limitation hypothesis,” is currently our best explanation for why 
trees have limited heights, even in perfect growing conditions. And using this model alongside 
growth rates and known needs for nutrients 
and photosynthesis, researchers have been able to propose 
height limits for specific species. So far these limits have held up – even the world’s tallest tree still falls 
about fifteen meters below the cap. Researchers are still investigating the 
possible explanations for this limit, and there may not be one universal 
reason why trees stop growing. But until we learn more, the height of trees is yet another
way that gravity, literally, shapes life on Earth.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, such as parenting and child development, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the topic of trees and how they transport sugars and nutrients.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar in terms of format, but it's still not similar in terms of content.

So, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: None

However, if you insist on an index, I would say: 3 (but keep in mind that this is a very weak match)

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Reaching heights of over 100 meters, Californian sequoias tower over Earth’s 
other estimated 60,000 tree species. Growing in the misty Sierra Nevada 
mountains, their massive trunks support the 
tallest known trees in the world. But even these behemoths seem 
to have their limits. No sequoia on record has been able 
to grow taller than 130 meters – and many researchers say these 
trees won’t beat that cap even if they live for thousands of 
years to come. So what exactly is stopping these trees 
from growing taller, forever? It all comes down to sap. In order for trees to grow, they need to bring sugars obtained 
from photosynthesis and nutrients brought in through the root 
system to wherever growth is happening. And just like blood circulates in 
the human body, trees are designed to circulate two kinds 
of sap throughout their bodies – carrying all the substances a 
tree’s cells need to live. The first is phloem sap. Containing the sugars generated in 
leaves during photosynthesis, phloem sap is thick, like honey, and flows down the plant’s phloem tissue 
to distribute sugar throughout the tree. By the end of its journey, the phloem sap has thinned 
into a watery substance, pooling at the base of the tree. Right beside the phloem is the tree’s 
other tissue type: the xylem. This tissue is packed with nutrients and 
ions like calcium, potassium, and iron, which the tree has absorbed 
through its roots. Here at the tree’s base, there are more of these particles in 
one tissue than the other, so the water from the phloem sap is 
absorbed into the xylem to correct the balance. This process, called osmotic movement, creates nutrient-rich xylem sap, which will then travel up the trunk to 
spread those nutrients through the tree. But this journey faces a formidable 
obstacle: gravity. To accomplish this herculean task, 
the xylem relies on three forces: transpiration, capillary action, 
and root pressure. As part of photosynthesis, leaves open 
and close pores called stomata. These openings allow oxygen and carbon 
dioxide in and out of the leaf, but they also create an opening through 
which water evaporates. This evaporation, called transpiration, creates negative pressure in the xylem, 
pulling watery xylem sap up the tree. This pull is aided by a fundamental 
property of water called capillary action. In narrow tubes, the attraction between water molecules and the adhesive forces between the water 
and its environment can beat out gravity. This capillary motion is in full effect 
in xylem filaments thinner than human hair. And where these two forces pull the sap, the osmotic movement at the tree’s 
base creates root pressure, pushing fresh xylem sap up the trunk. Together these forces launch sap 
to dizzying heights, distributing nutrients, and growing new 
leaves to photosynthesize – far above the tree’s roots. But despite these sophisticated systems, every centimeter is a fight 
against gravity. As trees grow taller and taller, the supply of these vital fluids 
begins to dwindle. At a certain height, trees can no longer afford the lost water 
that evaporates during photosynthesis. And without the photosynthesis needed 
to support additional growth, the tree instead turns its resources 
towards existing branches. This model, known as the “hydraulic 
limitation hypothesis,” is currently our best explanation for why 
trees have limited heights, even in perfect growing conditions. And using this model alongside 
growth rates and known needs for nutrients 
and photosynthesis, researchers have been able to propose 
height limits for specific species. So far these limits have held up – even the world’s tallest tree still falls 
about fifteen meters below the cap. Researchers are still investigating the 
possible explanations for this limit, and there may not be one universal 
reason why trees stop growing. But until we learn more, the height of trees is yet another
way that gravity, literally, shapes life on Earth.

**Transcript**:
Reaching heights of over 100 meters, Californian sequoias tower over Earth’s 
other estimated 60,000 tree species. Growing in the misty Sierra Nevada 
mountains, their massive trunks support the 
tallest known trees in the world. But even these behemoths seem 
to have their limits. No sequoia on record has been able 
to grow taller than 130 meters – and many researchers say these 
trees won’t beat that cap even if they live for thousands of 
years to come. So what exactly is stopping these trees 
from growing taller, forever? It all comes down to sap. In order for trees to grow, they need to bring sugars obtained 
from photosynthesis and nutrients brought in through the root 
system to wherever growth is happening. And just like blood circulates in 
the human body, trees are designed to circulate two kinds 
of sap throughout their bodies – carrying all the substances a 
tree’s cells need to live. The first is phloem sap. Containing the sugars generated in 
leaves during photosynthesis, phloem sap is thick, like honey, and flows down the plant’s phloem tissue 
to distribute sugar throughout the tree. By the end of its journey, the phloem sap has thinned 
into a watery substance, pooling at the base of the tree. Right beside the phloem is the tree’s 
other tissue type: the xylem. This tissue is packed with nutrients and 
ions like calcium, potassium, and iron, which the tree has absorbed 
through its roots. Here at the tree’s base, there are more of these particles in 
one tissue than the other, so the water from the phloem sap is 
absorbed into the xylem to correct the balance. This process, called osmotic movement, creates nutrient-rich xylem sap, which will then travel up the trunk to 
spread those nutrients through the tree. But this journey faces a formidable 
obstacle: gravity. To accomplish this herculean task, 
the xylem relies on three forces: transpiration, capillary action, 
and root pressure. As part of photosynthesis, leaves open 
and close pores called stomata. These openings allow oxygen and carbon 
dioxide in and out of the leaf, but they also create an opening through 
which water evaporates. This evaporation, called transpiration, creates negative pressure in the xylem, 
pulling watery xylem sap up the tree. This pull is aided by a fundamental 
property of water called capillary action. In narrow tubes, the attraction between water molecules and the adhesive forces between the water 
and its environment can beat out gravity. This capillary motion is in full effect 
in xylem filaments thinner than human hair. And where these two forces pull the sap, the osmotic movement at the tree’s 
base creates root pressure, pushing fresh xylem sap up the trunk. Together these forces launch sap 
to dizzying heights, distributing nutrients, and growing new 
leaves to photosynthesize – far above the tree’s roots. But despite these sophisticated systems, every centimeter is a fight 
against gravity. As trees grow taller and taller, the supply of these vital fluids 
begins to dwindle. At a certain height, trees can no longer afford the lost water 
that evaporates during photosynthesis. And without the photosynthesis needed 
to support additional growth, the tree instead turns its resources 
towards existing branches. This model, known as the “hydraulic 
limitation hypothesis,” is currently our best explanation for why 
trees have limited heights, even in perfect growing conditions. And using this model alongside 
growth rates and known needs for nutrients 
and photosynthesis, researchers have been able to propose 
height limits for specific species. So far these limits have held up – even the world’s tallest tree still falls 
about fifteen meters below the cap. Researchers are still investigating the 
possible explanations for this limit, and there may not be one universal 
reason why trees stop growing. But until we learn more, the height of trees is yet another
way that gravity, literally, shapes life on Earth.

**Transcript**:
Whether or not you realize it, as a surfer you’re a master 
of complicated physics. The science of surfing begins as soon as you and your board 
first hit the water. The board’s size and light construction 
help it displace a lot of water. In turn, a buoyant force equal to the weight of the 
displaced water pushes up, counteracting you and your board’s weight. This lets you stay afloat while 
you wait to paddle for a wave. And what exactly are you waiting for? The perfect wave, of course. Like other waves in physics, ocean waves
represent a transfer of energy. Wind blowing across the ocean accelerates 
water particles near the surface, leading to the growth of ripples 
that become waves. These deviations from the flat surface 
are acted upon by gravity, which tries to restore the surface 
to its original flat state. As the waves then move through the water, particles push and pull on their neighbors
through the wave induced pressure, and this motion propagates energy through 
the water in unison with the wave motion. The motion of these particles is much more limited than the 
overall motion of the waves. Near the shore, the shallower seafloor constrains 
the motion of the waves to occur in a more limited region 
than out at sea, concentrating the wave energy 
near the surface. If the topography of the shoreline 
is even and smooth, this will refract the waves 
to become more parallel to the shore as they approach. This is the crucial moment. As the wave gets near, you quickly pivot your board 
in the same direction as the wave and paddle to match its speed. Your board forms an angle with the water, and this creates a dynamic pressure 
on the bottom of it, forcing you and your board 
out of the water, to skim along the surface. At the same time, your increased forward momentum 
makes you more stable, allowing you to stand up 
and surf along the wave. Now you’ve caught the wave, and are riding along its front 
face parallel to the shoreline. Fins on the surfboard allow you to alter 
your speed and direction by repositioning your weight. Above you is the wave’s crest, where the water particles are undergoing
their greatest acceleration. That forces them to move faster 
than the underlying wave, so they shoot ahead before falling under
gravity’s influence. This forms the waves’ characteristic
curls, or jets, as they break along the shore. Sometimes, the curl might completely 
enclose part of the wave, forming a moving tube of water 
known as the barrel. Because of irregularities in the seafloor 
and the swell itself, few barrels last as long as the legendary 
27-second ride off the coast of Namibia. But many who manage to get barreled have said they feel time 
passing differently inside, making it one of the most magical 
experiences a surfer can have. Of course, not all beaches are created equal. Offshore underwater canyons or rock
formations in certain locations like Nazare, Portugal
or Mavericks, California refract the incoming wave energy 
into a single spot, creating massive waves 
sought by surfers worldwide. And some of these waves travel 
for more than a week, with swells originating more than 10,000 
kilometers away from shore. Waves surfed in sunny California may have originated in the stormy 
seas near New Zealand. So while you may not be thinking about 
weather patterns in the South Pacific, tectonic geology, or fluid mechanics, the art of catching the perfect wave 
relies on all these things and more. And the waves we surf, created by wind, are just one visible part of the 
continuous oscillation of energy that has shaped our universe

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to depression and mental health, while the ground truth MCQ is related to the physics of surfing.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 7: **Knowledge**: What is a common misconception about people with depression? is the most similar. But this is a very weak match, as the content and intent of the question are completely different.

A more accurate answer would be "None of the above" or "No match found". But if I had to provide an index, I would say:

Index: 7 (with a strong caveat that this is a very weak match)

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Whether or not you realize it, as a surfer you’re a master 
of complicated physics. The science of surfing begins as soon as you and your board 
first hit the water. The board’s size and light construction 
help it displace a lot of water. In turn, a buoyant force equal to the weight of the 
displaced water pushes up, counteracting you and your board’s weight. This lets you stay afloat while 
you wait to paddle for a wave. And what exactly are you waiting for? The perfect wave, of course. Like other waves in physics, ocean waves
represent a transfer of energy. Wind blowing across the ocean accelerates 
water particles near the surface, leading to the growth of ripples 
that become waves. These deviations from the flat surface 
are acted upon by gravity, which tries to restore the surface 
to its original flat state. As the waves then move through the water, particles push and pull on their neighbors
through the wave induced pressure, and this motion propagates energy through 
the water in unison with the wave motion. The motion of these particles is much more limited than the 
overall motion of the waves. Near the shore, the shallower seafloor constrains 
the motion of the waves to occur in a more limited region 
than out at sea, concentrating the wave energy 
near the surface. If the topography of the shoreline 
is even and smooth, this will refract the waves 
to become more parallel to the shore as they approach. This is the crucial moment. As the wave gets near, you quickly pivot your board

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Whether or not you realize it, as a surfer you’re a master 
of complicated physics. The science of surfing begins as soon as you and your board 
first hit the water. The board’s size and light construction 
help it displace a lot of water. In turn, a buoyant force equal to the weight of the 
displaced water pushes up, counteracting you and your board’s weight. This lets you stay afloat while 
you wait to paddle for a wave. And what exactly are you waiting for? The perfect wave, of course. Like other waves in physics, ocean waves
represent a transfer of energy. Wind blowing across the ocean accelerates 
water particles near the surface, leading to the growth of ripples 
that become waves. These deviations from the flat surface 
are acted upon by gravity, which tries to restore the surface 
to its original flat state. As the waves then move through the water, particles push and pull on their neighbors
through the wave induced pressure, and this motion propagates energy through 
the water in unison with the wave motion. The motion of these particles is much more limited than the 
overall motion of the waves. Near the shore, the shallower seafloor constrains 
the motion of the waves to occur in a more limited region 
than out at sea, concentrating the wave energy 
near the surface. If the topography of the shoreline 
is even and smooth, this will refract the waves 
to become more parallel to the shore as they approach. This is the crucial moment. As the wave gets near, you quickly pivot your board 
in the same direction as the wave and paddle to match its speed. Your board forms an angle with the water, and this creates a dynamic pressure 
on the bottom of it, forcing you and your board 
out of the water, to skim along the surface. At the same time, your increased forward momentum 
makes you more stable, allowing you to stand up 
and surf along the wave. Now you’ve caught the wave, and are riding along its front 
face parallel to the shoreline. Fins on the surfboard allow you to alter 
your speed and direction by repositioning your weight. Above you is the wave’s crest, where the water particles are undergoing
their greatest acceleration. That forces them to move faster 
than the underlying wave, so they shoot ahead before falling under
gravity’s influence. This forms the waves’ characteristic
curls, or jets, as they break along the shore. Sometimes, the curl might completely 
enclose part of the wave, forming a moving tube of water 
known as the barrel. Because of irregularities in the seafloor 
and the swell itself, few barrels last as long as the legendary 
27-second ride off the coast of Namibia. But many who manage to get barreled have said they feel time 
passing differently inside, making it one of the most magical 
experiences a surfer can have. Of course, not all beaches are created equal. Offshore underwater canyons or rock
formations in certain locations like Nazare, Portugal
or Mavericks, California refract the incoming wave energy 
into a single spot, creating massive waves 
sought by surfers worldwide. And some of these waves travel 
for more than a week, with swells originating more than 10,000 
kilometers away from shore. Waves surfed in sunny California may have originated in the stormy 
seas near New Zealand. So while you may not be thinking about 
weather patterns in the South Pacific, tectonic geology, or fluid mechanics, the art of catching the perfect wave 
relies on all these things and more. And the waves we surf, created by wind, are just one visible part of the 
continuous oscillation of energy that has shaped our universe 
since its very beginning.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to depression and mental health, while the ground truth MCQ is related to the physics of surfing and wave behavior.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 4: **Analysis** is the closest match. This question has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ, with a question and four options, and it requires analysis and understanding of the subject matter.

But, I must emphasize that the content and intent of Question 4 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4 (with a big caveat that it's not a good match)

**Transcript**:
“From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked… but choosing one meant 
losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped 
to the ground at my feet.” In this passage from Sylvia Plath’s 
"The Bell Jar," a young woman imagines 
an uncertain future– and speaks to the universal fear of becoming paralyzed by the prospect of making 
the wrong choice. Although she considered other careers, Plath chose the artist’s way. Poetry was her calling. Under her shrewd eye and pen, everyday objects became haunting images: a “new statue in a drafty museum,” a shadow in a mirror, a slab of soap. Fiercely intelligent, 
penetrating and witty, Plath was also diagnosed 
with clinical depression. She used poetry to explore her own states 
of mind in the most intimate terms, and her breathtaking perspectives 
on emotion, nature and art continue 
to captivate and resonate. In her first collection of poems, "The Colossus," she wrote of a feeling of nothingness: "white: it is a complexion of the mind.” At the same time, she found solace in nature, from “a blue mist” “dragging the lake,” to white flowers that “tower and topple,” to blue mussels “clumped like bulbs.” After "The Colossus" she 
published "The Bell Jar," her only novel, which fictionalizes the time she spent 
working for Mademoiselle magazine in New York during college. The novel follows its heroine, Esther, as she slides into a severe 
depressive episode, but also includes wickedly funny and 
shrewd depictions of snobby fashion parties 
and dates with dull men. Shortly after the publication 
of "The Bell Jar," Plath died by suicide at age 30. Two years later, the collection of poems
she wrote in a burst of creative energy during the months before her death was published under the title "Ariel." Widely considered her masterpiece, Ariel exemplifies the honesty 
and imagination Plath harnessed to capture her pain. In one of "Ariel's" most forceful poems, "Lady Lazarus," she explores her attempts 
to take her own life through Lazarus, the biblical figure who rose 
from the dead. She writes, “and I a smiling woman/
I am only thirty/ And like the cat I have
nine times to die.” But the poem is also a testament 
to survival: “I rise with my red hair/
And I eat men like air.” This unflinching language has made Plath 
an important touchstone for countless other readers and writers who sought to break the silence surrounding issues of trauma, 
frustration, and sexuality. "Ariel" is also filled with moving 
meditations on heartbreak and creativity. The title poem begins “Stasis in darkness/ Then the substanceless blue/
Pour of tor and distances.” This sets the scene for a naked ride 
on horseback in the early morning— one of Plath’s most memorable expressions
of the elation of creative freedom. But it is also full of foreboding 
imagery, such as “a child's cry” that “melts 
in the wall” and a “red/eye, the cauldron 
of morning.” This darkness is echoed throughout 
the collection, which includes controversial references 
to the holocaust and the Kamikazes. Even the relics of seemingly happier times
are described as crucifying the author: “My husband and child smiling out 
of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, 
little smiling hooks.” Her domestic dissatisfaction and her 
husband’s mistreatment of her are constant themes in her later poetry. After her death, he inherited her estate, and has been accused of excluding 
some of her work from publication. Despite these possible omissions 
and her untimely death, what survives is one of the most 
extraordinary bodies of work by a twentieth century poet. While her work can be shocking in 
its rage and trauma, Plath casts her readers as witnesses– not only to the truth of her 
psychological life, but to her astounding ability to express 
what often remains inexpressible.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to the Rorschach Test, which is not mentioned in the provided transcript.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of mental health, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but only in the sense that it mentions diagnosing mental illness, which is related to the topic of Sylvia Plath's depression.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5 (Note: This is a very weak match and not a good representation of the ground truth MCQ)

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the transcript and the topic of Sylvia Plath's life and work.

**Transcript**:
“From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked… but choosing one meant 
losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped 
to the ground at my feet.” In this passage from Sylvia Plath’s 
"The Bell Jar," a young woman imagines 
an uncertain future– and speaks to the universal fear of becoming paralyzed by the prospect of making 
the wrong choice. Although she considered other careers, Plath chose the artist’s way. Poetry was her calling. Under her shrewd eye and pen, everyday objects became haunting images: a “new statue in a drafty museum,” a shadow in a mirror, a slab of soap. Fiercely intelligent, 
penetrating and witty, Plath was also diagnosed 
with clinical depression. She used poetry to explore her own states 
of mind in the most intimate terms, and her breathtaking perspectives 
on emotion, nature and art continue 
to captivate and resonate. In her first collection of poems, "The Colossus," she wrote of a feeling of nothingness: "white: it is a complexion of the mind.” At the same time, she found solace in nature, from “a blue mist” “dragging the lake,” to white flowers that “tower and topple,” to blue mussels “clumped like bulbs.” After "The Colossus" she 
published "The Bell Jar," her only novel, which fictionalizes the time she spent 
working for Mademoiselle magazine in New York during college. The novel follows its heroine, Esther, as she slides into a severe 
depressive episode, but also includes wickedly funny and 
shrewd depictions of snobby fashion parties 
and dates with dull men. Shortly after the publication 
of "The Bell Jar," Plath died by suicide at age 30. Two years later, the collection of poems
she wrote in a burst of creative energy during the months before her death was published under the title "Ariel." Widely considered her masterpiece, Ariel exemplifies the honesty 
and imagination Plath harnessed to capture her pain. In one of "Ariel's" most forceful poems, "Lady Lazarus," she explores her attempts 
to take her own life through Lazarus, the biblical figure who rose 
from the dead. She writes, “and I a smiling woman/
I am only thirty/ And like the cat I have
nine times to die.” But the poem is also a testament 
to survival: “I rise with my red hair/
And I eat men like air.” This unflinching language has made Plath 
an important touchstone for countless other readers and writers who sought to break the silence surrounding issues of trauma, 
frustration, and sexuality. "Ariel" is also filled with moving 
meditations on heartbreak and creativity. The title poem begins “Stasis in darkness/ Then the substanceless blue/
Pour of tor and distances.” This sets the scene for a naked ride 
on horseback in the early morning— one of Plath’s most memorable expressions
of the elation of creative freedom. But it is also full of foreboding 
imagery, such as “a child's cry” that “melts 
in the wall” and a “red/eye, the cauldron 
of morning.” This darkness is echoed throughout 
the collection, which includes controversial references 
to the holocaust and the Kamikazes. Even the relics of seemingly happier times
are described as crucifying the author: “My husband and child smiling out 
of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, 
little smiling hooks.” Her domestic dissatisfaction and her 
husband’s mistreatment of her are constant themes in her later poetry. After her death, he inherited her estate, and has been accused of excluding 
some of her work from publication. Despite these possible omissions 
and her untimely death, what survives is one of the most 
extraordinary bodies of work by a twentieth century poet. While her work can be shocking in 
its rage and trauma, Plath casts her readers as witnesses– not only to the truth of her 
psychological life, but to her astounding ability to express 
what often remains inexpressible.

**Transcript**:
Take a look at this image. What might this be? A frightening monster? Two friendly bears? Or something else entirely? For nearly a century, ten inkblots like these have been used as what seems like an almost 
mystical personality test. Long kept confidential for psychologists 
and their patients, the mysterious images were said to draw
out the workings of a person’s mind. But what can inkblots really tell us, and how does this test work? Invented in the early 20th century 
by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach, the Rorschach Test is actually less about 
the specific things we see, and more about our general approach 
to perception. As an amateur artist Hermann was fascinated by how visual 
perception varies from person to person. He carried this interest to 
medical school, where he learned all our senses 
are deeply connected. He studied how our process of perception 
doesn’t just register sensory inputs, but transforms them. And when he started working at a 
mental hospital in eastern Switzerland, he began designing a series 
of puzzling images to gain new insight into this 
enigmatic process. Using his inkblot paintings, Rorschach began quizzing hundreds 
of healthy subjects and psychiatric patients with 
the same question: what might this be? However, it wasn’t what the test subjects 
saw that was most important to Rorschach, but rather, how they approached the task. Which parts of the image did they 
focus on or ignore? Did they see the image moving? Did the color on some inkblots help them 
give better answers, or distract and overwhelm them? He developed a system to code 
people’s responses, reducing the wide range of interpretations
to a few manageable numbers. Now he had empirical measures to quantify 
all kinds of test takers: the creative and imaginative, the detail-oriented, the 
big-picture perceivers, and flexible participants able 
to adapt their approach. Some people would get stuck, offering the same answer 
for multiple blots. Others gave unusual and 
delightful descriptions. Responses were as varied as the inkblots, which offered different kinds of 
perceptual problems– some easier to interpret than others. But analyzing the test-taker’s 
overall approach yielded real insights into 
their psychology. And as Rorschach tested more 
and more people, patterns began to pile up. Healthy subjects with the same 
personalities often took remarkably similar approaches. Patients suffering from the same 
mental illnesses also performed similarly, making the test a reliable 
diagnostic tool. It could even diagnose some conditions difficult to pinpoint with other 
available methods. In 1921, Rorschach published his coding system 
alongside the ten blots he felt gave the most nuanced picture of people’s
perceptual approach. Over the next several decades, the test became wildly popular in 
countries around the world. By the 1960s, it had been officially administered 
millions of times in the U.S. alone. Unfortunately, less than a year after 
publishing the test, Hermann Rorschach had died suddenly. Without its inventor to keep it on track, the test he had methodically gathered 
so much data to support began to be used in all sorts 
of speculative ways. Researchers gave the test 
to Nazi war criminals, hoping to unlock the psychological roots 
of mass murder. Anthropologists showed the images to 
remote communities as a sort of universal personality test. Employers made prejudiced hiring decisions
based on reductive decoding charts. As the test left clinics and entered 
popular culture its reputation among medical 
professionals plummeted, and the blots began to fall 
out of clinical use. Today, the test is still controversial, and many people assume 
it has been disproven. But a massive 2013 review of all the 
existing Rorschach research showed that when administered properly 
the test yields valid results, which can help diagnose mental illness or round out a patient’s 
psychological profile. It’s hardly a stand-alone key 
to the human mind– no test is. But its visual approach and lack 
of any single right answer continue to help psychologists paint
a more nuanced picture of how people see the world. Bringing us one step closer to understanding the patterns 
behind our perceptions.

doesn’t just register sensory inputs, but transforms them. And when he started working at a 
mental hospital in eastern Switzerland, he began designing a series 
of puzzling images to gain new insight into this 
enigmatic process. Using his inkblot paintings, Rorschach began quizzing hundreds 
of healthy subjects and psychiatric patients with 
the same question: what might this be? However, it wasn’t what the test subjects 
saw that was most important to Rorschach, but rather, how they approached the task. Which parts of the image did they 
focus on or ignore? Did they see the image moving? Did the color on some inkblots help them 
give better answers, or distract and overwhelm them? He developed a system to code 
people’s responses, reducing the wide range of interpretations
to a few manageable numbers. Now he had empirical measures to quantify 
all kinds of test takers: the creative and imaginative, the detail-oriented, the 
big-picture perceivers, and flexible participants able 
to adapt their approach. Some people would get stuck, offering the same answer 
for multiple blots. Others gave unusual and 
delightful descriptions. Responses were as varied as the inkblots, which offered different kinds of 
perceptual problems– some easier to interpret than others. But analyzing the test-taker’s 
overall approach yielded real insights into 
their psychology. And as Rorschach tested more 
and more people, patterns began to pile up. Healthy subjects with the same 
personalities often took remarkably similar approaches. Patients suffering from the same 
mental illnesses also performed similarly, making the test a reliable 
diagnostic tool. It could even diagnose some conditions difficult to pinpoint with other 
available methods. In 1921, Rorschach published his coding system 
alongside the ten blots he felt gave the most nuanced picture of people’s
perceptual approach. Over the next several decades, the test became wildly popular in 
countries around the world. By the 1960s, it had been officially administered 
millions of times in the U.S. alone. Unfortunately, less than a year after 
publishing the test, Hermann Rorschach had died suddenly. Without its inventor to keep it on track, the test he had methodically gathered 
so much data to support began to be used in all sorts 
of speculative ways. Researchers gave the test 
to Nazi war criminals, hoping to unlock the psychological roots 
of mass murder. Anthropologists showed the images to 
remote communities as a sort of universal personality test. Employers made prejudiced hiring decisions
based on reductive decoding charts. As the test left clinics and entered 
popular culture its reputation among medical 
professionals plummeted, and the blots began to fall 
out of clinical use. Today, the test is still controversial, and many people assume 
it has been disproven. But a massive 2013 review of all the 
existing Rorschach research showed that when administered properly 
the test yields valid results, which can help diagnose mental illness or round out a patient’s 
psychological profile. It’s hardly a stand-alone key 
to the human mind– no test is. But its visual approach and lack 
of any single right answer continue to help psychologists paint
a more nuanced picture of how people see the world. Bringing us one step closer to understanding the patterns 
behind our perceptions.

**Transcript**:
Take a look at this image. What might this be? A frightening monster? Two friendly bears? Or something else entirely? For nearly a century, ten inkblots like these have been used as what seems like an almost 
mystical personality test. Long kept confidential for psychologists 
and their patients, the mysterious images were said to draw
out the workings of a person’s mind. But what can inkblots really tell us, and how does this test work? Invented in the early 20th century 
by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach, the Rorschach Test is actually less about 
the specific things we see, and more about our general approach 
to perception. As an amateur artist Hermann was fascinated by how visual 
perception varies from person to person. He carried this interest to 
medical school, where he learned all our senses 
are deeply connected. He studied how our process of perception 
doesn’t just register sensory inputs, but transforms them. And when he started working at a

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is least dissimilar.

The ground truth MCQ is about the Rorschach Test's scientific reputation today as a diagnostic tool. The generated MCQs are about unrelated topics such as online lingo, podcasts, and activism.

If I had to choose the least dissimilar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 3, but only because it has a similar format (question + options) and is also about a specific concept. However, the content and intent are completely different.

Index: 3 (Note: This is a very weak match and not recommended for actual use.)

In reality, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new generated MCQ that is specifically about the Rorschach Test's scientific reputation today as a diagnostic tool would be needed to provide a good match.

**Transcript**:
Your timing made you and your partner the most infamous bank robbers 
in the west. Now, you’ll need to use that timing 
to help you break out of jail. At the appointed time, you’ll be walking 
in the yard near the electric fence. Your partner will flash you the signal, and exactly 45 seconds later, short out the fence circuit. It’ll automatically restart 
after a second or two, but as long as you move fast, you’ll be home free. And then you notice, to your horror, that your watch is broken, and there’s no time to fix it. The signal is coming, and if you make even a small mistake 
in counting off 45 seconds, you’ll get fried. Searching your pockets, you find something that might help: a lighter and two fuses you made earlier 
in the prison work program. Each fuse is a length of flammable twine, built to be lit on either end 
and burn for precisely one minute. The problem is that even though 
the fuses look uniform, they don’t burn evenly, so if you cut one in half, for example, one side might burn longer than the other. Your partner is going to give 
the signal any minute, and you’ll have to make your move. How can you use the fuses and lighter 
to time exactly 45 seconds? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The length of the fuse may 
not tell you anything, but you do know the fuses take exactly
60 seconds to burn from end to end. Here’s the key insight: If you start a fuse on one side 
and it burns for 30 seconds, there’ll still be 30 seconds of fuse left. If you had started it from the other end, it would’ve reached the exact 
same spot in thirty seconds. That means that if you lit it 
from both ends simultaneously, it would burn out in precisely 30 seconds. But how will you time the last fifteen? That’ll have to come from the second fuse. If it were a 30 second fuse, you’d be able to use that same trick again to double the burning speed and 
make it last exactly 15 seconds. And, you realize, you can 
shorten the second fuse by lighting one end of it at the same time
as you light the first. At the moment the first burns out, you’ll be left with 30 seconds 
on the second fuse. Just when you’ve got this all figured out, you see the signal from your partner, and spring into action. You gather the four ends of the two 
fuses and light three of them. The moment the first burns out, you light the other end 
of the second fuse. When it flickers and dies, you know that exactly 45 
seconds have passed, and the electric fence is dead. By the time it hiccups back to life, you’re over the fence and home free.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a way to create a matching MCQ.

To create a matching MCQ, the question should be related to the content of the transcript, which is about using fuses and a lighter to time exactly 45 seconds. A potential matching MCQ could be:

Question: How long does a single fuse burn?
Options: A. 30 seconds, B. 45 seconds, C. 1 minute, D. 2 minutes
Correct Option: C

Since none of the generated MCQs match this format, I will not provide an index. However, if you would like, I can help you generate new MCQs that match the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Your timing made you and your partner the most infamous bank robbers 
in the west. Now, you’ll need to use that timing 
to help you break out of jail. At the appointed time, you’ll be walking 
in the yard near the electric fence. Your partner will flash you the signal, and exactly 45 seconds later, short out the fence circuit. It’ll automatically restart 
after a second or two, but as long as you move fast, you’ll be home free. And then you notice, to your horror, that your watch is broken, and there’s no time to fix it. The signal is coming, and if you make even a small mistake 
in counting off 45 seconds, you’ll get fried. Searching your pockets, you find something that might help: a lighter and two fuses you made earlier 
in the prison work program. Each fuse is a length of flammable twine, built to be lit on either end 
and burn for precisely one minute. The problem is that even though 
the fuses look uniform, they don’t burn evenly, so if you cut one in half, for example, one side might burn longer than the other. Your partner is going to give 
the signal any minute, and you’ll have to make your move. How can you use the fuses and lighter 
to time exactly 45 seconds? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The length of the fuse may 
not tell you anything, but you do know the fuses take exactly
60 seconds to burn from end to end. Here’s the key insight: If you start a fuse on one side 
and it burns for 30 seconds, there’ll still be 30 seconds of fuse left. If you had started it from the other end, it would’ve reached the exact 
same spot in thirty seconds. That means that if you lit it 
from both ends simultaneously, it would burn out in precisely 30 seconds. But how will you time the last fifteen? That’ll have to come from the second fuse. If it were a 30 second fuse, you’d be able to use that same trick again to double the burning speed and 
make it last exactly 15 seconds. And, you realize, you can 
shorten the second fuse by lighting one end of it at the same time
as you light the first. At the moment the first burns out, you’ll be left with 30 seconds 
on the second fuse. Just when you’ve got this all figured out, you see the signal from your partner, and spring into action. You gather the four ends of the two 
fuses and light three of them. The moment the first burns out, you light the other end 
of the second fuse. When it flickers and dies, you know that exactly 45 
seconds have passed, and the electric fence is dead. By the time it hiccups back to life, you’re over the fence and home free.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, focusing on education, diversity, and inclusion, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the transcript, which is about using fuses and a lighter to time exactly 45 seconds.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But, if you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ based on the transcript. Here's an example:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Your timing made you and your partner the most infamous bank robbers 
in the west. Now, you’ll need to use that timing 
to help you break out of jail. At the appointed time, you’ll be walking 
in the yard near the electric fence. Your partner will flash you the signal, and exactly 45 seconds later, short out the fence circuit. It’ll automatically restart 
after a second or two, but as long as you move fast, you’ll be home free. And then you notice, to your horror, that your watch is broken, and there’s no time to fix it. The signal is coming, and if you make even a small mistake 
in counting off 45 seconds, you’ll get fried. Searching your pockets, you find something that might help: a lighter and two fuses you made earlier 
in the prison work program. Each fuse is a length of flammable twine, built to be lit on either end 
and burn for precisely one minute. The problem is that even though 
the fuses look uniform, they don’t burn evenly, so if you cut one in half, for example, one side might burn longer than the other. Your partner is going to give 
the signal any minute, and you’ll have to make your move. How can you use the fuses and lighter 
to time exactly 45 seconds? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The length of the fuse may 
not tell you anything, but you do know the fuses take exactly
60 seconds to burn from end to end. Here’s the key insight: If you start a fuse on one side 
and it burns for 30 seconds, there’ll still be 30 seconds of fuse left. If you had started it from the other end, it would’ve reached the exact 
same spot in thirty seconds. That means that if you lit it 
from both ends simultaneously, it would burn out in precisely 30 seconds. But how will you time the last fifteen? That’ll have to come from the second fuse. If it were a 30 second fuse, you’d be able to use that same trick again to double the burning speed and 
make it last exactly 15 seconds. And, you realize, you can 
shorten the second fuse by lighting one end of it at the same time
as you light the first. At the moment the first burns out, you’ll be left with 30 seconds 
on the second fuse. Just when you’ve got this all figured out, you see the signal from your partner, and spring into action. You gather the four ends of the two 
fuses and light three of them. The moment the first burns out, you light the other end 
of the second fuse. When it flickers and dies, you know that exactly 45 
seconds have passed, and the electric fence is dead. By the time it hiccups back to life, you’re over the fence and home free.

make it last exactly 15 seconds. And, you realize, you can 
shorten the second fuse by lighting one end of it at the same time
as you light the first. At the moment the first burns out, you’ll be left with 30 seconds 
on the second fuse. Just when you’ve got this all figured out, you see the signal from your partner, and spring into action. You gather the four ends of the two 
fuses and light three of them. The moment the first burns out, you light the other end 
of the second fuse. When it flickers and dies, you know that exactly 45 
seconds have passed, and the electric fence is dead. By the time it hiccups back to life, you’re over the fence and home free.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How long does the second fuse burn in all in the final answer?
Options: A. 30 seconds, B. 45 seconds, C. 1 minute, D. No way to know exactly how long

**Transcript**:
We know about our universe’s past: the Big Bang theory predicts that all 
matter, time, and space began in an incredibly tiny, compact 
state about 14 billion years ago. And we know about the present: scientists’ observations of the movement 
of galaxies tell us that the universe is expanding 
at an accelerated rate. But what about the future? Do we know how our universe 
is going to end? Cosmologists have three 
possible answers for this question, called the Big Freeze, the Big Rip and the Big Crunch. To understand these three scenarios, imagine two objects representing galaxies. A short, tight rubber band is 
holding them together— that’s the attractive force of gravity. Meanwhile, two hooks are 
pulling them apart— that’s the repulsive force 
expanding the universe. Copy this system over and over again, and you have something 
approximating the real universe. The outcome of the battle between 
these two opposing forces determines how the end of the 
universe will play out. The Big Freeze scenario is what happens 
if the force pulling the objects apart is just strong enough to stretch the 
rubber band until it loses its elasticity. The expansion wouldn’t be able to 
accelerate anymore, but the universe would keep 
getting bigger. Clusters of galaxies would separate. The objects within the galaxies– suns, planets, and solar systems would move away from each other, until galaxies dissolved into 
lonely objects floating separately in the vast space. The light they emit would be redshifted 
to long wavelengths with very low, faint energies, and the gas emanating from them 
would be too thin to create new stars. The universe would become 
darker and colder, approaching a frozen state also known as the Big Chill, or the Heat Death of the Universe. But what if the repulsive force 
is so strong that it stretches the rubber band 
past its elastic limit, and actually tears it? If the expansion of the universe 
continues to accelerate, it will eventually overcome not only 
the gravitational force – tearing apart galaxies and solar systems– but also the electromagnetic, weak, 
and strong nuclear forces which hold atoms and nuclei together. As a result, the matter that makes up stars 
breaks into tiny pieces. Even atoms and subatomic particles 
will be destroyed. That’s the Big Rip. What about the third scenario, where the rubber band wins out? That corresponds to a possible future in which the force of gravity brings the 
universe’s expansion to a halt— and then reverses it. Galaxies would start rushing 
towards each other, and as they clumped together their gravitational pull would 
get even stronger. Stars too would hurtle 
together and collide. Temperatures would rise as space 
would get tighter and tighter. The size of the universe would plummet until everything compressed into such 
a small space that even atoms and subatomic particles 
would have to crunch together. The result would be an incredibly dense,
hot, compact universe — a lot like the state that 
preceded the Big Bang. This is the Big Crunch. Could this tiny point of matter explode 
in another Big Bang? Could the universe expand and contract
over and over again, repeating its entire history? The theory describing such a universe 
is known as the Big Bounce. In fact, there’s no way to tell how many 
bounces could’ve already happened— or how many might happen in the future. Each bounce would wipe away any record
of the universe’s previous history. Which one of those scenarios 
will be the real one? The answer depends on the exact shape 
of the universe, the amount of dark energy it holds, and changes in its expansion rate. As of now, our observations suggest 
that we’re heading for a Big Freeze. But the good news is that we’ve probably 
got about 10 to the 100th power years before the chill sets in — so don’t start stocking up 
on mittens just yet.

possible answers for this question, called the Big Freeze, the Big Rip and the Big Crunch. To understand these three scenarios, imagine two objects representing galaxies. A short, tight rubber band is 
holding them together— that’s the attractive force of gravity. Meanwhile, two hooks are 
pulling them apart— that’s the repulsive force 
expanding the universe. Copy this system over and over again, and you have something 
approximating the real universe. The outcome of the battle between 
these two opposing forces determines how the end of the 
universe will play out. The Big Freeze scenario is what happens 
if the force pulling the objects apart is just strong enough to stretch the 
rubber band until it loses its elasticity. The expansion wouldn’t be able to 
accelerate anymore, but the universe would keep 
getting bigger. Clusters of galaxies would separate. The objects within the galaxies– suns, planets, and solar systems would move away from each other, until galaxies dissolved into 
lonely objects floating separately in the vast space. The light they emit would be redshifted 
to long wavelengths with very low, faint energies, and the gas emanating from them 
would be too thin to create new stars. The universe would become 
darker and colder, approaching a frozen state also known as the Big Chill, or the Heat Death of the Universe. But what if the repulsive force 
is so strong that it stretches the rubber band 
past its elastic limit, and actually tears it? If the expansion of the universe 
continues to accelerate, it will eventually overcome not only 
the gravitational force – tearing apart galaxies and solar systems– but also the electromagnetic, weak, 
and strong nuclear forces which hold atoms and nuclei together. As a result, the matter that makes up stars 
breaks into tiny pieces. Even atoms and subatomic particles 
will be destroyed. That’s the Big Rip. What about the third scenario, where the rubber band wins out? That corresponds to a possible future in which the force of gravity brings the 
universe’s expansion to a halt— and then reverses it. Galaxies would start rushing 
towards each other, and as they clumped together their gravitational pull would 
get even stronger. Stars too would hurtle 
together and collide. Temperatures would rise as space 
would get tighter and tighter. The size of the universe would plummet until everything compressed into such 
a small space that even atoms and subatomic particles 
would have to crunch together. The result would be an incredibly dense,
hot, compact universe — a lot like the state that 
preceded the Big Bang. This is the Big Crunch. Could this tiny point of matter explode 
in another Big Bang? Could the universe expand and contract
over and over again, repeating its entire history? The theory describing such a universe 
is known as the Big Bounce. In fact, there’s no way to tell how many 
bounces could’ve already happened— or how many might happen in the future. Each bounce would wipe away any record
of the universe’s previous history. Which one of those scenarios 
will be the real one? The answer depends on the exact shape 
of the universe, the amount of dark energy it holds, and changes in its expansion rate. As of now, our observations suggest 
that we’re heading for a Big Freeze. But the good news is that we’ve probably 
got about 10 to the 100th power years before the chill sets in — so don’t start stocking up 
on mittens just yet.

**Transcript**:
Here are two images of a house. There’s one obvious difference, but to this patient, P.S., they looked completely identical. P.S. had suffered a stroke that 
damaged the right side of her brain, leaving her unaware of everything 
on her left side. But though she could discern no difference
between the houses, when researchers asked her 
which she would prefer to live in, she chose the house that wasn’t burning— not once, but again and again. P.S.’s brain was still processing 
information from her whole field of vision. She could see both images and tell the difference between them, she just didn’t know it. If someone threw a ball at her left side, she might duck. But she wouldn’t have any 
awareness of the ball, or any idea why she ducked. P.S.’s condition, known as hemispatial neglect, reveals an important distinction between 
the brain’s processing of information and our experience of that processing. That experience is what 
we call consciousness. We are conscious of both the external 
world and our internal selves— we are aware of an image in much the same way we are aware of 
ourselves looking at an image, or our inner thoughts and emotions. But where does consciousness come from? Scientists, theologians, and philosophers have been trying to get to the bottom of 
this question for centuries— without reaching any consensus. One recent theory is that consciousness is the brain’s imperfect 
picture of its own activity. To understand this theory, it helps to have a clear idea of one important way the brain processes 
information from our senses. Based on sensory input, it builds models, which are continuously updating,
simplified descriptions of objects and events in the world. Everything we know is based 
on these models. They never capture every detail of 
the things they describe, just enough for the brain to determine 
appropriate responses. For instance, one model built deep 
into the visual system codes white light as brightness 
without color. In reality, white light includes wavelengths that correspond to all the 
different colors we can see. Our perception of white light is wrong 
and oversimplified, but good enough for us to function. Likewise, the brain’s model of the 
physical body keeps track of the configuration 
of our limbs, but not of individual cells 
or even muscles, because that level of information 
isn’t needed to plan movement. If it didn’t have the model keeping track 
of the body’s size, shape, and how it is moving at any moment, we would quickly injure ourselves. The brain also needs models of itself. For example, the brain has the ability to pay attention
to specific objects and events. It also controls that focus, shifting it from one thing to another, internal and external, according to our needs. Without the ability to direct our focus, we wouldn’t be able to assess threats, 
finish a meal, or function at all. To control focus effectively, the brain has to construct a model 
of its own attention. With 86 billion neurons constantly 
interacting with each other, there’s no way the brain’s model of its 
own information processing can be perfectly self-descriptive. But like the model of the body, or our conception of white light, it doesn’t have to be. Our certainty that we have a 
metaphysical, subjective experience may come from one of the brain’s models, a cut-corner description of what it means
to process information in a focused and deep manner. Scientists have already begun trying 
to figure out how the brain creates that self model. MRI studies are a promising avenue 
for pinpointing the networks involved. These studies compare patterns 
of neural activation when someone is and isn’t conscious 
of a sensory stimulus, like an image. The results show that the areas needed 
for visual processing are activated whether or not the 
participant is aware of the image, but a whole additional network lights up only when they are conscious 
of seeing the image. Patients with hemispatial neglect, 
like P.S., typically have damage to one particular 
part of this network. More extensive damage to the network 
can sometimes lead to a vegetative state, with no sign of consciousness. Evidence like this brings us closer 
to understanding how consciousness is built into the brain, but there’s still much more to learn. For instance, the way neurons in the networks 
related to consciousness compute specific pieces of information is outside the scope of our 
current technology. As we approach questions of consciousness 
with science, we’ll open new lines of inquiry 
into human identity.

**Transcript**:
Here are two images of a house. There’s one obvious difference, but to this patient, P.S., they looked completely identical. P.S. had suffered a stroke that 
damaged the right side of her brain, leaving her unaware of everything 
on her left side. But though she could discern no difference
between the houses, when researchers asked her 
which she would prefer to live in, she chose the house that wasn’t burning— not once, but again and again. P.S.’s brain was still processing 
information from her whole field of vision. She could see both images and tell the difference between them, she just didn’t know it. If someone threw a ball at her left side, she might duck. But she wouldn’t have any 
awareness of the ball, or any idea why she ducked. P.S.’s condition, known as hemispatial neglect, reveals an important distinction between 
the brain’s processing of information and our experience of that processing. That experience is what 
we call consciousness. We are conscious of both the external 
world and our internal selves— we are aware of an image in much the same way we are aware of 
ourselves looking at an image, or our inner thoughts and emotions. But where does consciousness come from? Scientists, theologians, and philosophers have been trying to get to the bottom of 
this question for centuries— without reaching any consensus. One recent theory is that consciousness is the brain’s imperfect 
picture of its own activity. To understand this theory, it helps to have a clear idea of one important way the brain processes 
information from our senses. Based on sensory input, it builds models, which are continuously updating,
simplified descriptions of objects and events in the world. Everything we know is based 
on these models. They never capture every detail of 
the things they describe, just enough for the brain to determine 
appropriate responses. For instance, one model built deep 
into the visual system codes white light as brightness 
without color. In reality, white light includes wavelengths that correspond to all the 
different colors we can see. Our perception of white light is wrong 
and oversimplified, but good enough for us to function. Likewise, the brain’s model of the 
physical body keeps track of the configuration 
of our limbs, but not of individual cells 
or even muscles, because that level of information 
isn’t needed to plan movement. If it didn’t have the model keeping track 
of the body’s size, shape, and how it is moving at any moment, we would quickly injure ourselves. The brain also needs models of itself. For example, the brain has the ability to pay attention
to specific objects and events. It also controls that focus, shifting it from one thing to another, internal and external, according to our needs. Without the ability to direct our focus, we wouldn’t be able to assess threats, 
finish a meal, or function at all. To control focus effectively, the brain has to construct a model 
of its own attention. With 86 billion neurons constantly 
interacting with each other, there’s no way the brain’s model of its 
own information processing can be perfectly self-descriptive. But like the model of the body, or our conception of white light, it doesn’t have to be. Our certainty that we have a 
metaphysical, subjective experience may come from one of the brain’s models, a cut-corner description of what it means
to process information in a focused and deep manner. Scientists have already begun trying 
to figure out how the brain creates that self model. MRI studies are a promising avenue 
for pinpointing the networks involved. These studies compare patterns 
of neural activation when someone is and isn’t conscious 
of a sensory stimulus, like an image. The results show that the areas needed 
for visual processing are activated whether or not the 
participant is aware of the image, but a whole additional network lights up only when they are conscious 
of seeing the image. Patients with hemispatial neglect, 
like P.S., typically have damage to one particular 
part of this network. More extensive damage to the network 
can sometimes lead to a vegetative state, with no sign of consciousness. Evidence like this brings us closer 
to understanding how consciousness is built into the brain, but there’s still much more to learn. For instance, the way neurons in the networks 
related to consciousness compute specific pieces of information is outside the scope of our 
current technology. As we approach questions of consciousness 
with science, we’ll open new lines of inquiry 
into human identity.

**Transcript**:
Here are two images of a house. There’s one obvious difference, but to this patient, P.S., they looked completely identical. P.S. had suffered a stroke that 
damaged the right side of her brain, leaving her unaware of everything 
on her left side. But though she could discern no difference
between the houses, when researchers asked her 
which she would prefer to live in, she chose the house that wasn’t burning— not once, but again and again. P.S.’s brain was still processing 
information from her whole field of vision. She could see both images and tell the difference between them, she just didn’t know it. If someone threw a ball at her left side, she might duck. But she wouldn’t have any 
awareness of the ball, or any idea why she ducked. P.S.’s condition, known as hemispatial neglect, reveals an important distinction between 
the brain’s processing of information and our experience of that processing. That experience is what 
we call consciousness. We are conscious of both the external 
world and our internal selves— we are aware of an image in much the same way we are aware of 
ourselves looking at an image, or our inner thoughts and emotions. But where does consciousness come from? Scientists, theologians, and philosophers have been trying to get to the bottom of 
this question for centuries— without reaching any consensus. One recent theory is that consciousness is the brain’s imperfect 
picture of its own activity. To understand this theory, it helps to have a clear idea of one important way the brain processes 
information from our senses. Based on sensory input, it builds models, which are continuously updating,
simplified descriptions of objects and events in the world. Everything we know is based 
on these models. They never capture every detail of 
the things they describe, just enough for the brain to determine 
appropriate responses. For instance, one model built deep 
into the visual system codes white light as brightness 
without color. In reality, white light includes wavelengths that correspond to all the 
different colors we can see. Our perception of white light is wrong 
and oversimplified, but good enough for us to function. Likewise, the brain’s model of the 
physical body keeps track of the configuration 
of our limbs, but not of individual cells 
or even muscles, because that level of information 
isn’t needed to plan movement. If it didn’t have the model keeping track 
of the body’s size, shape, and how it is moving at any moment, we would quickly injure ourselves. The brain also needs models of itself. For example, the brain has the ability to pay attention
to specific objects and events. It also controls that focus, shifting it from one thing to another, internal and external, according to our needs. Without the ability to direct our focus, we wouldn’t be able to assess threats, 
finish a meal, or function at all. To control focus effectively, the brain has to construct a model 
of its own attention. With 86 billion neurons constantly 
interacting with each other, there’s no way the brain’s model of its 
own information processing can be perfectly self-descriptive. But like the model of the body, or our conception of white light, it doesn’t have to be. Our certainty that we have a 
metaphysical, subjective experience may come from one of the brain’s models, a cut-corner description of what it means
to process information in a focused and deep manner. Scientists have already begun trying 
to figure out how the brain creates that self model. MRI studies are a promising avenue 
for pinpointing the networks involved. These studies compare patterns 
of neural activation when someone is and isn’t conscious 
of a sensory stimulus, like an image. The results show that the areas needed 
for visual processing are activated whether or not the 
participant is aware of the image, but a whole additional network lights up only when they are conscious 
of seeing the image. Patients with hemispatial neglect, 
like P.S., typically have damage to one particular 
part of this network. More extensive damage to the network 
can sometimes lead to a vegetative state, with no sign of consciousness. Evidence like this brings us closer 
to understanding how consciousness is built into the brain, but there’s still much more to learn. For instance, the way neurons in the networks 
related to consciousness compute specific pieces of information is outside the scope of our 
current technology. As we approach questions of consciousness 
with science, we’ll open new lines of inquiry 
into human identity.

**Transcript**:
Claps of thunder and flashes of lightning
illuminate a swelling sea, as a ship buckles beneath the waves.  This is no ordinary storm, 
but a violent and vengeful tempest, and it sets the stage for Shakespeare’s
most enigmatic play. As the skies clear, 
we are invited into a world that seems far removed from our own,
but is rife with familiar concerns about freedom, power, and control. The Tempest is set on a desert island,
exposed to the elements and ruled with magic and might by 
Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan. Betrayed by his brother Antonio, 
Prospero has been marooned on the island for twelve years with his daughter Miranda
and his beloved books. In this time he’s learned the 
magic of the island and uses it to harness its 
elementary spirits. He also rules over the island’s
only earthly inhabitant, the dejected and demonized Caliban. But after years of plotting revenge,
Prospero’s foe is finally in sight. With the help of the 
fluttering sprite Ariel, the magician destroys his brother’s ship
and washes its sailors ashore. Prospero’s plotting even extends to his
daughter’s love life, whom he plans to fall for 
stranded prince Ferdinand. And as Prospero and Ariel
close in on Antonio, Caliban joins forces with some 
drunken sailors, who hatch a comic plot 
to take the island. The play strips society down
to its basest desires, with each faction in hot pursuit of power-
be it over the land, other people, or their own destiny. But Shakespeare knows that power is
always a moving target; and as he reveals
these characters’ dark histories, we begin to wonder if this
vicious cycle will ever end. Although Prospero was wronged by Antonio, he has long inflicted his
own abuses on the island, hoarding its magical properties
and natural re-sources for himself. Caliban especially resents
this takeover. The son of Sycorax, a witch who previously
ruled the island, he initially helped the 
exiles find their footing. But he’s since become their slave,
and rants with furious regret: “And then I loved thee,/
And showed thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle/
The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place 
and fertile./ Cursed be I that did so!” With his thunderous language
and seething anger, Caliban constantly reminds
Prospero of what came before: this island’s mine by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me. Yet Sycorax also abused the island, and imprisoned Ariel until 
Prospero released him. Now Ariel spends the play hoping to repay
his debt and earn his freedom, while Caliban is enslaved indefinitely,
or at least as long as Prospero is in charge. For these reasons and many more, The Tempest has often been read as
an exploration of colonialism, and the moral dilemmas that come
with en-counters of “brave new world(s)." Questions of agency and justice
hang over the play: is Caliban the rightful 
master of the land? Will Ariel flutter free?  And is Prospero the 
mighty overseer- or is there some deeper magic at work,
beyond any one character's grasp? Throughout the play, Ariel constantly reminds Prospero
of the freedom he is owed. But the question lingers of whether
the invader will be able to relinquish his grip. The question of ending one’s reign is
particularly potent given that The Tempest is believed to be 
Shakespeare’s final play. In many ways Prospero’s actions echo that
of the great entertainer him-self, who hatched elaborate plots,
maneuvered those around him, and cast a spell over characters
and audience alike. But by the end of his grand performance
of power and control, Prospero’s final lines see him humbled
by his audience - and the power
that they hold over his creations. "With the help of your good hands./
Gentle breath of yours my sails/ Must fill or else my project fails,/
Which was to please." This evokes Shakespeare’s own role
as the great entertainer who surrenders himself,
ultimately, to our applause.

but is rife with familiar concerns about freedom, power, and control. The Tempest is set on a desert island,
exposed to the elements and ruled with magic and might by 
Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan. Betrayed by his brother Antonio, 
Prospero has been marooned on the island for twelve years with his daughter Miranda
and his beloved books. In this time he’s learned the 
magic of the island and uses it to harness its 
elementary spirits. He also rules over the island’s
only earthly inhabitant, the dejected and demonized Caliban. But after years of plotting revenge,
Prospero’s foe is finally in sight. With the help of the 
fluttering sprite Ariel, the magician destroys his brother’s ship
and washes its sailors ashore. Prospero’s plotting even extends to his
daughter’s love life, whom he plans to fall for 
stranded prince Ferdinand. And as Prospero and Ariel
close in on Antonio, Caliban joins forces with some 
drunken sailors, who hatch a comic plot 
to take the island. The play strips society down
to its basest desires, with each faction in hot pursuit of power-
be it over the land, other people, or their own destiny. But Shakespeare knows that power is
always a moving target; and as he reveals
these characters’ dark histories, we begin to wonder if this
vicious cycle will ever end. Although Prospero was wronged by Antonio, he has long inflicted his
own abuses on the island, hoarding its magical properties
and natural re-sources for himself. Caliban especially resents
this takeover. The son of Sycorax, a witch who previously
ruled the island, he initially helped the 
exiles find their footing. But he’s since become their slave,
and rants with furious regret: “And then I loved thee,/
And showed thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle/
The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place 
and fertile./ Cursed be I that did so!” With his thunderous language
and seething anger, Caliban constantly reminds
Prospero of what came before: this island’s mine by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me. Yet Sycorax also abused the island, and imprisoned Ariel until 
Prospero released him. Now Ariel spends the play hoping to repay
his debt and earn his freedom, while Caliban is enslaved indefinitely,
or at least as long as Prospero is in charge. For these reasons and many more, The Tempest has often been read as
an exploration of colonialism, and the moral dilemmas that come
with en-counters of “brave new world(s)." Questions of agency and justice
hang over the play: is Caliban the rightful 
master of the land? Will Ariel flutter free?  And is Prospero the 
mighty overseer- or is there some deeper magic at work,
beyond any one character's grasp? Throughout the play, Ariel constantly reminds Prospero
of the freedom he is owed. But the question lingers of whether
the invader will be able to relinquish his grip. The question of ending one’s reign is
particularly potent given that The Tempest is believed to be 
Shakespeare’s final play. In many ways Prospero’s actions echo that
of the great entertainer him-self, who hatched elaborate plots,
maneuvered those around him, and cast a spell over characters
and audience alike. But by the end of his grand performance
of power and control, Prospero’s final lines see him humbled
by his audience - and the power
that they hold over his creations. "With the help of your good hands./
Gentle breath of yours my sails/ Must fill or else my project fails,/
Which was to please." This evokes Shakespeare’s own role

ultimately, to our applause.

**Transcript**:
This syringe contains a radioactive form 
of glucose known as FDG. The doctor will soon inject its contents 
into her patient’s arm, whom she’s testing for cancer 
using a PET scanner. The FDG will quickly circulate 
through his body. If he has a tumor, cancer cells within it will take up a 
significant portion of the FDG, which will act as a beacon 
for the scanner. PET tracers such as FDG are among the most remarkable tools 
in medical diagnostics, and their life begins in 
a particle accelerator, just hours earlier. The particle accelerator in question 
is called a cyclotron, and it’s often housed in a bunker 
within hospitals. It uses electromagnetic fields to propel 
charged particles like protons faster and faster 
along a spiraling path. When the protons reach 
their maximum speed, they shoot out onto a target that contains
a few milliliters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen 
called oxygen-18. When a proton slams into one of these 
heavier oxygen atoms, it kicks out another subatomic particle 
called a neutron. This impact turns oxygen-18 
into fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that can be 
detected on a PET scan. In a little under two hours, about half the fluorine will be gone 
due to radioactive decay, so the clock is ticking 
to get the scan done. So how can fluorine-18 be 
used to detect diseases? Radiochemists at the hospital can use 
a series of chemical reactions to attach the radioactive fluorine 
to different molecules, creating radiotracers. The identity of the tracer depends on what
doctors want to observe. FDG is a common one because the rate at 
which cells consume glucose can signal the presence of cancer; the location of an infection; or the slowing brain function of dementia. The FDG is now ready for 
the patient’s scan. When a radiolabeled tracer 
enters the body, it travels through the circulatory system 
and gets taken up by its target— whether that's a protein in the brain,
cancer cells, or otherwise. Within a few minutes, a significant amount of the tracer has 
found its way to the target area and the rest has cleared from circulation. Now the doctors can see 
their target using a PET, or positron emission tomography, scanner. The radiation that the tracer emits 
is what makes this possible. The isotopes used in PET decay 
by positron emission. Positrons are essentially electrons 
with positive charge. When emitted, a positron collides 
with an electron from another molecule in its surroundings. This causes a tiny nuclear reaction in which the mass of the two particles is 
converted into two high-energy photons, similar to X-rays, that shoot out in opposite directions. These photons will then impact an array of paired radiation detectors 
in the scanner walls. The software in the scanner 
uses those detectors to estimate where inside the body 
the collision occurred and create a 3D map of the 
tracer’s distribution. PET scans can detect the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with 
other types of imaging. They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis
of Alzheimer’s disease by allowing doctors to see amyloid, the telltale protein buildup that 
otherwise couldn’t be confirmed without an autopsy. Meanwhile, researchers are actively 
working to develop new tracers and expand the possibilities of what 
PET scans can be used for. But with all this talk of radiation and
nuclear reactions inside the body, are these scans safe? Even though no amount of ionizing 
radiation is completely safe, the amount of radiation the body receives
during a PET scan is actually quite low. One scan is comparable to what you’re 
exposed to over two or three years from natural radioactive sources, 
like radon gas; or the amount a pilot would rack up from cosmic radiation after 
20 to 30 transatlantic flights. Most patients feel that those risks 
are acceptable for the chance to diagnose 
and treat their illnesses.

converted into two high-energy photons, similar to X-rays, that shoot out in opposite directions. These photons will then impact an array of paired radiation detectors 
in the scanner walls. The software in the scanner 
uses those detectors to estimate where inside the body 
the collision occurred and create a 3D map of the 
tracer’s distribution. PET scans can detect the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with 
other types of imaging. They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis
of Alzheimer’s disease by allowing doctors to see amyloid, the telltale protein buildup that 
otherwise couldn’t be confirmed without an autopsy. Meanwhile, researchers are actively

PET scans can be used for. But with all this talk of radiation and
nuclear reactions inside the body, are these scans safe? Even though no amount of ionizing 
radiation is completely safe, the amount of radiation the body receives
during a PET scan is actually quite low. One scan is comparable to what you’re 
exposed to over two or three years from natural radioactive sources, 
like radon gas; or the amount a pilot would rack up from cosmic radiation after 
20 to 30 transatlantic flights. Most patients feel that those risks 
are acceptable for the chance to diagnose

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
This syringe contains a radioactive form 
of glucose known as FDG. The doctor will soon inject its contents 
into her patient’s arm, whom she’s testing for cancer 
using a PET scanner. The FDG will quickly circulate 
through his body. If he has a tumor, cancer cells within it will take up a 
significant portion of the FDG, which will act as a beacon 
for the scanner. PET tracers such as FDG are among the most remarkable tools 
in medical diagnostics, and their life begins in 
a particle accelerator, just hours earlier. The particle accelerator in question 
is called a cyclotron, and it’s often housed in a bunker 
within hospitals. It uses electromagnetic fields to propel 
charged particles like protons faster and faster 
along a spiraling path. When the protons reach 
their maximum speed, they shoot out onto a target that contains
a few milliliters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen 
called oxygen-18. When a proton slams into one of these 
heavier oxygen atoms, it kicks out another subatomic particle 
called a neutron. This impact turns oxygen-18 
into fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that can be 
detected on a PET scan. In a little under two hours, about half the fluorine will be gone 
due to radioactive decay, so the clock is ticking 
to get the scan done. So how can fluorine-18 be 
used to detect diseases? Radiochemists at the hospital can use 
a series of chemical reactions to attach the radioactive fluorine 
to different molecules, creating radiotracers. The identity of the tracer depends on what
doctors want to observe. FDG is a common one because the rate at 
which cells consume glucose can signal the presence of cancer; the location of an infection; or the slowing brain function of dementia. The FDG is now ready for 
the patient’s scan. When a radiolabeled tracer 
enters the body, it travels through the circulatory system 
and gets taken up by its target— whether that's a protein in the brain,
cancer cells, or otherwise. Within a few minutes, a significant amount of the tracer has 
found its way to the target area and the rest has cleared from circulation. Now the doctors can see 
their target using a PET, or positron emission tomography, scanner. The radiation that the tracer emits 
is what makes this possible. The isotopes used in PET decay 
by positron emission. Positrons are essentially electrons 
with positive charge. When emitted, a positron collides 
with an electron from another molecule in its surroundings. This causes a tiny nuclear reaction in which the mass of the two particles is 
converted into two high-energy photons, similar to X-rays, that shoot out in opposite directions. These photons will then impact an array of paired radiation detectors 
in the scanner walls. The software in the scanner 
uses those detectors to estimate where inside the body 
the collision occurred and create a 3D map of the 
tracer’s distribution. PET scans can detect the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with 
other types of imaging. They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis
of Alzheimer’s disease by allowing doctors to see amyloid, the telltale protein buildup that

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A shooting star crashes on Earth, and a hideous blob emerges. It creeps and leaps, it glides and slides. It’s also unstoppable: weapons, fire, extreme temperatures… no matter what you throw at it, it just regrows and continues its rampage. Its expansion is breathtaking; it doubles in size every hour. But there’s one opportunity: after each hour, it goes to sleep, forming itself into a flat triangle and resting for a few minutes before it begins eating and growing again. Your only chance to save the planet involves a satellite-mounted nano-fission
ray that can cut through the blob. When the blog is active it heals itself within seconds. However, when you break the sleeping 
blob into two triangles, you make a critical discovery. The acute triangle portion, with all angles less than 90 degrees, 
is inert. It never “wakes up.” The obtuse triangle, which has an angle greater 
than 90 degrees, wakes up as usual and keeps growing. Similar experiments show that all shapes 
other than acute triangles, including right triangles, 
will also wake up. For the next few minutes, the blob is sleeping in its 
obtuse triangle form. You can make clean, straight-line cuts between any two points 
on or inside the triangle. But you’ll only have time to make 
7 cuts while the satellite is above you. By the time it completes 
its orbit and returns, the blob will have consumed 
the entire world, if even a single portion that 
will wake up remains. How can you cut the blob entirely 
into acute triangles and stop it from destroying the planet? Pause the video now 
to figure out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 While this seems doable at first, there’s a hidden difficulty when it comes
to avoiding obtuse and right angles. Every time you make a cut that 
reaches an edge, it either makes an acute and 
an obtuse angle, or two right angles. That makes it seems like you’re doomed
to keep creating obtuse angles. But as with so many of life’s problems, we can look to pizza for inspiration. Imagine squaring off the 
outside of a pizza, so that instead of a circle, 
it’s an octagon. When we cut it into slices, each of the eight triangles is acute. This works with larger polygons too. Importantly, it also works for some 
polygons with fewer sides, including heptagons, hexagons, 
and pentagons. That’s good news, because if you cut off the sharp corners 
of the blob triangle, a pentagon is exactly what 
you’ll be left with. And just like a pizza, you can cut the blob pentagon 
into five acute triangles. That’s 7 cuts, and it renders the 
blob completely inert. You’ve saved the day! Now you just need to figure out what to do with all of these giant, practically 
indestructible triangles.

A shooting star crashes on Earth, and a hideous blob emerges. It creeps and leaps, it glides and slides. It’s also unstoppable: weapons, fire, extreme temperatures… no matter what you throw at it, it just regrows and continues its rampage. Its expansion is breathtaking; it doubles in size every hour. But there’s one opportunity: after each hour, it goes to sleep, forming itself into a flat triangle and resting for a few minutes before it begins eating and growing again. Your only chance to save the planet involves a satellite-mounted nano-fission
ray that can cut through the blob. When the blog is active it heals itself within seconds. However, when you break the sleeping 
blob into two triangles, you make a critical discovery. The acute triangle portion, with all angles less than 90 degrees, 
is inert. It never “wakes up.” The obtuse triangle, which has an angle greater 
than 90 degrees, wakes up as usual and keeps growing. Similar experiments show that all shapes 
other than acute triangles, including right triangles, 
will also wake up. For the next few minutes, the blob is sleeping in its 
obtuse triangle form. You can make clean, straight-line cuts between any two points 
on or inside the triangle. But you’ll only have time to make 
7 cuts while the satellite is above you. By the time it completes 
its orbit and returns, the blob will have consumed 
the entire world, if even a single portion that 
will wake up remains. How can you cut the blob entirely 
into acute triangles and stop it from destroying the planet? Pause the video now 
to figure out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 While this seems doable at first, there’s a hidden difficulty when it comes
to avoiding obtuse and right angles. Every time you make a cut that 
reaches an edge, it either makes an acute and 
an obtuse angle, or two right angles. That makes it seems like you’re doomed
to keep creating obtuse angles. But as with so many of life’s problems, we can look to pizza for inspiration. Imagine squaring off the 
outside of a pizza, so that instead of a circle, 
it’s an octagon. When we cut it into slices, each of the eight triangles is acute. This works with larger polygons too. Importantly, it also works for some 
polygons with fewer sides, including heptagons, hexagons, 
and pentagons. That’s good news, because if you cut off the sharp corners 
of the blob triangle, a pentagon is exactly what 
you’ll be left with. And just like a pizza, you can cut the blob pentagon 
into five acute triangles. That’s 7 cuts, and it renders the 
blob completely inert. You’ve saved the day! Now you just need to figure out what to do with all of these giant, practically 
indestructible triangles.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Reaching heights of over 100 meters, Californian sequoias tower over Earth’s 
other estimated 60,000 tree species. Growing in the misty Sierra Nevada 
mountains, their massive trunks support the 
tallest known trees in the world. But even these behemoths seem 
to have their limits. No sequoia on record has been able 
to grow taller than 130 meters – and many researchers say these 
trees won’t beat that cap even if they live for thousands of 
years to come. So what exactly is stopping these trees 
from growing taller, forever? It all comes down to sap. In order for trees to grow, they need to bring sugars obtained 
from photosynthesis and nutrients brought in through the root 
system to wherever growth is happening. And just like blood circulates in 
the human body, trees are designed to circulate two kinds 
of sap throughout their bodies – carrying all the substances a 
tree’s cells need to live. The first is phloem sap. Containing the sugars generated in 
leaves during photosynthesis, phloem sap is thick, like honey, and flows down the plant’s phloem tissue 
to distribute sugar throughout the tree. By the end of its journey, the phloem sap has thinned 
into a watery substance, pooling at the base of the tree. Right beside the phloem is the tree’s 
other tissue type: the xylem. This tissue is packed with nutrients and 
ions like calcium, potassium, and iron, which the tree has absorbed 
through its roots. Here at the tree’s base, there are more of these particles in 
one tissue than the other, so the water from the phloem sap is 
absorbed into the xylem to correct the balance. This process, called osmotic movement, creates nutrient-rich xylem sap, which will then travel up the trunk to 
spread those nutrients through the tree. But this journey faces a formidable 
obstacle: gravity. To accomplish this herculean task, 
the xylem relies on three forces: transpiration, capillary action, 
and root pressure. As part of photosynthesis, leaves open 
and close pores called stomata. These openings allow oxygen and carbon 
dioxide in and out of the leaf, but they also create an opening through 
which water evaporates. This evaporation, called transpiration, creates negative pressure in the xylem, 
pulling watery xylem sap up the tree. This pull is aided by a fundamental 
property of water called capillary action. In narrow tubes, the attraction between water molecules and the adhesive forces between the water 
and its environment can beat out gravity. This capillary motion is in full effect 
in xylem filaments thinner than human hair. And where these two forces pull the sap, the osmotic movement at the tree’s 
base creates root pressure, pushing fresh xylem sap up the trunk. Together these forces launch sap 
to dizzying heights, distributing nutrients, and growing new 
leaves to photosynthesize – far above the tree’s roots. But despite these sophisticated systems, every centimeter is a fight 
against gravity. As trees grow taller and taller, the supply of these vital fluids 
begins to dwindle. At a certain height, trees can no longer afford the lost water 
that evaporates during photosynthesis. And without the photosynthesis needed 
to support additional growth, the tree instead turns its resources 
towards existing branches. This model, known as the “hydraulic 
limitation hypothesis,” is currently our best explanation for why 
trees have limited heights, even in perfect growing conditions. And using this model alongside 
growth rates and known needs for nutrients 
and photosynthesis, researchers have been able to propose 
height limits for specific species. So far these limits have held up – even the world’s tallest tree still falls 
about fifteen meters below the cap. Researchers are still investigating the 
possible explanations for this limit, and there may not be one universal 
reason why trees stop growing. But until we learn more, the height of trees is yet another
way that gravity, literally, shapes life on Earth.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Reaching heights of over 100 meters, Californian sequoias tower over Earth’s 
other estimated 60,000 tree species. Growing in the misty Sierra Nevada 
mountains, their massive trunks support the 
tallest known trees in the world. But even these behemoths seem 
to have their limits. No sequoia on record has been able 
to grow taller than 130 meters – and many researchers say these 
trees won’t beat that cap even if they live for thousands of 
years to come. So what exactly is stopping these trees 
from growing taller, forever? It all comes down to sap. In order for trees to grow, they need to bring sugars obtained 
from photosynthesis and nutrients brought in through the root 
system to wherever growth is happening. And just like blood circulates in 
the human body, trees are designed to circulate two kinds 
of sap throughout their bodies – carrying all the substances a 
tree’s cells need to live. The first is phloem sap. Containing the sugars generated in 
leaves during photosynthesis, phloem sap is thick, like honey, and flows down the plant’s phloem tissue 
to distribute sugar throughout the tree. By the end of its journey, the phloem sap has thinned 
into a watery substance, pooling at the base of the tree. Right beside the phloem is the tree’s 
other tissue type: the xylem. This tissue is packed with nutrients and 
ions like calcium, potassium, and iron, which the tree has absorbed 
through its roots. Here at the tree’s base, there are more of these particles in 
one tissue than the other, so the water from the phloem sap is 
absorbed into the xylem to correct the balance. This process, called osmotic movement, creates nutrient-rich xylem sap, which will then travel up the trunk to 
spread those nutrients through the tree. But this journey faces a formidable 
obstacle: gravity. To accomplish this herculean task, 
the xylem relies on three forces: transpiration, capillary action, 
and root pressure. As part of photosynthesis, leaves open 
and close pores called stomata. These openings allow oxygen and carbon 
dioxide in and out of the leaf, but they also create an opening through 
which water evaporates. This evaporation, called transpiration, creates negative pressure in the xylem, 
pulling watery xylem sap up the tree. This pull is aided by a fundamental 
property of water called capillary action. In narrow tubes, the attraction between water molecules and the adhesive forces between the water 
and its environment can beat out gravity. This capillary motion is in full effect 
in xylem filaments thinner than human hair. And where these two forces pull the sap, the osmotic movement at the tree’s 
base creates root pressure, pushing fresh xylem sap up the trunk. Together these forces launch sap 
to dizzying heights, distributing nutrients, and growing new 
leaves to photosynthesize – far above the tree’s roots. But despite these sophisticated systems, every centimeter is a fight 
against gravity. As trees grow taller and taller, the supply of these vital fluids 
begins to dwindle. At a certain height, trees can no longer afford the lost water 
that evaporates during photosynthesis. And without the photosynthesis needed 
to support additional growth, the tree instead turns its resources 
towards existing branches. This model, known as the “hydraulic 
limitation hypothesis,” is currently our best explanation for why 
trees have limited heights, even in perfect growing conditions. And using this model alongside 
growth rates and known needs for nutrients 
and photosynthesis, researchers have been able to propose 
height limits for specific species. So far these limits have held up – even the world’s tallest tree still falls 
about fifteen meters below the cap. Researchers are still investigating the 
possible explanations for this limit, and there may not be one universal 
reason why trees stop growing. But until we learn more, the height of trees is yet another
way that gravity, literally, shapes life on Earth.

**Transcript**:
Whether or not you realize it, as a surfer you’re a master 
of complicated physics. The science of surfing begins as soon as you and your board 
first hit the water. The board’s size and light construction 
help it displace a lot of water. In turn, a buoyant force equal to the weight of the 
displaced water pushes up, counteracting you and your board’s weight. This lets you stay afloat while 
you wait to paddle for a wave. And what exactly are you waiting for? The perfect wave, of course. Like other waves in physics, ocean waves
represent a transfer of energy. Wind blowing across the ocean accelerates 
water particles near the surface, leading to the growth of ripples 
that become waves. These deviations from the flat surface 
are acted upon by gravity, which tries to restore the surface 
to its original flat state. As the waves then move through the water, particles push and pull on their neighbors
through the wave induced pressure, and this motion propagates energy through 
the water in unison with the wave motion. The motion of these particles is much more limited than the 
overall motion of the waves. Near the shore, the shallower seafloor constrains 
the motion of the waves to occur in a more limited region 
than out at sea, concentrating the wave energy 
near the surface. If the topography of the shoreline 
is even and smooth, this will refract the waves 
to become more parallel to the shore as they approach. This is the crucial moment. As the wave gets near, you quickly pivot your board 
in the same direction as the wave and paddle to match its speed. Your board forms an angle with the water, and this creates a dynamic pressure 
on the bottom of it, forcing you and your board 
out of the water, to skim along the surface. At the same time, your increased forward momentum 
makes you more stable, allowing you to stand up 
and surf along the wave. Now you’ve caught the wave, and are riding along its front 
face parallel to the shoreline. Fins on the surfboard allow you to alter 
your speed and direction by repositioning your weight. Above you is the wave’s crest, where the water particles are undergoing
their greatest acceleration. That forces them to move faster 
than the underlying wave, so they shoot ahead before falling under
gravity’s influence. This forms the waves’ characteristic
curls, or jets, as they break along the shore. Sometimes, the curl might completely 
enclose part of the wave, forming a moving tube of water 
known as the barrel. Because of irregularities in the seafloor 
and the swell itself, few barrels last as long as the legendary 
27-second ride off the coast of Namibia. But many who manage to get barreled have said they feel time 
passing differently inside, making it one of the most magical 
experiences a surfer can have. Of course, not all beaches are created equal. Offshore underwater canyons or rock
formations in certain locations like Nazare, Portugal
or Mavericks, California refract the incoming wave energy 
into a single spot, creating massive waves 
sought by surfers worldwide. And some of these waves travel 
for more than a week, with swells originating more than 10,000 
kilometers away from shore. Waves surfed in sunny California may have originated in the stormy 
seas near New Zealand. So while you may not be thinking about 
weather patterns in the South Pacific, tectonic geology, or fluid mechanics, the art of catching the perfect wave 
relies on all these things and more. And the waves we surf, created by wind, are just one visible part of the 
continuous oscillation of energy that has shaped our universe 
since its very beginning.

through the wave induced pressure, and this motion propagates energy through 
the water in unison with the wave motion. The motion of these particles is much more limited than the 
overall motion of the waves. Near the shore, the shallower seafloor constrains 
the motion of the waves to occur in a more limited region 
than out at sea, concentrating the wave energy 
near the surface. If the topography of the shoreline 
is even and smooth, this will refract the waves 
to become more parallel to the shore as they approach. This is the crucial moment. As the wave gets near, you quickly pivot your board 
in the same direction as the wave and paddle to match its speed. Your board forms an angle with the water, and this creates a dynamic pressure 
on the bottom of it, forcing you and your board 
out of the water, to skim along the surface. At the same time, your increased forward momentum 
makes you more stable, allowing you to stand up 
and surf along the wave. Now you’ve caught the wave, and are riding along its front 
face parallel to the shoreline. Fins on the surfboard allow you to alter 
your speed and direction by repositioning your weight. Above you is the wave’s crest, where the water particles are undergoing
their greatest acceleration. That forces them to move faster 
than the underlying wave, so they shoot ahead before falling under
gravity’s influence. This forms the waves’ characteristic
curls, or jets, as they break along the shore. Sometimes, the curl might completely 
enclose part of the wave, forming a moving tube of water 
known as the barrel. Because of irregularities in the seafloor 
and the swell itself, few barrels last as long as the legendary 
27-second ride off the coast of Namibia. But many who manage to get barreled have said they feel time 
passing differently inside, making it one of the most magical 
experiences a surfer can have. Of course, not all beaches are created equal. Offshore underwater canyons or rock
formations in certain locations like Nazare, Portugal
or Mavericks, California refract the incoming wave energy 
into a single spot, creating massive waves 
sought by surfers worldwide. And some of these waves travel 
for more than a week, with swells originating more than 10,000 
kilometers away from shore. Waves surfed in sunny California may have originated in the stormy 
seas near New Zealand. So while you may not be thinking about 
weather patterns in the South Pacific, tectonic geology, or fluid mechanics, the art of catching the perfect wave 
relies on all these things and more. And the waves we surf, created by wind, are just one visible part of the 
continuous oscillation of energy that has shaped our universe 
since its very beginning.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

**Transcript**:
“From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked… but choosing one meant 
losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped 
to the ground at my feet.” In this passage from Sylvia Plath’s 
"The Bell Jar," a young woman imagines 
an uncertain future– and speaks to the universal fear of becoming paralyzed by the prospect of making 
the wrong choice. Although she considered other careers, Plath chose the artist’s way. Poetry was her calling. Under her shrewd eye and pen, everyday objects became haunting images: a “new statue in a drafty museum,” a shadow in a mirror, a slab of soap. Fiercely intelligent, 
penetrating and witty, Plath was also diagnosed 
with clinical depression. She used poetry to explore her own states 
of mind in the most intimate terms, and her breathtaking perspectives 
on emotion, nature and art continue 
to captivate and resonate. In her first collection of poems, "The Colossus," she wrote of a feeling of nothingness: "white: it is a complexion of the mind.” At the same time, she found solace in nature, from “a blue mist” “dragging the lake,” to white flowers that “tower and topple,” to blue mussels “clumped like bulbs.” After "The Colossus" she 
published "The Bell Jar," her only novel, which fictionalizes the time she spent 
working for Mademoiselle magazine in New York during college. The novel follows its heroine, Esther, as she slides into a severe 
depressive episode, but also includes wickedly funny and 
shrewd depictions of snobby fashion parties 
and dates with dull men. Shortly after the publication 
of "The Bell Jar," Plath died by suicide at age 30. Two years later, the collection of poems
she wrote in a burst of creative energy during the months before her death was published under the title "Ariel." Widely considered her masterpiece, Ariel exemplifies the honesty 
and imagination Plath harnessed to capture her pain. In one of "Ariel's" most forceful poems, "Lady Lazarus," she explores her attempts 
to take her own life through Lazarus, the biblical figure who rose 
from the dead. She writes, “and I a smiling woman/
I am only thirty/ And like the cat I have
nine times to die.” But the poem is also a testament 
to survival: “I rise with my red hair/
And I eat men like air.” This unflinching language has made Plath 
an important touchstone for countless other readers and writers who sought to break the silence surrounding issues of trauma, 
frustration, and sexuality. "Ariel" is also filled with moving 
meditations on heartbreak and creativity. The title poem begins “Stasis in darkness/ Then the substanceless blue/
Pour of tor and distances.” This sets the scene for a naked ride 
on horseback in the early morning— one of Plath’s most memorable expressions
of the elation of creative freedom. But it is also full of foreboding 
imagery, such as “a child's cry” that “melts 
in the wall” and a “red/eye, the cauldron 
of morning.” This darkness is echoed throughout 
the collection, which includes controversial references 
to the holocaust and the Kamikazes. Even the relics of seemingly happier times
are described as crucifying the author: “My husband and child smiling out 
of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, 
little smiling hooks.” Her domestic dissatisfaction and her 
husband’s mistreatment of her are constant themes in her later poetry. After her death, he inherited her estate, and has been accused of excluding 
some of her work from publication. Despite these possible omissions 
and her untimely death, what survives is one of the most 
extraordinary bodies of work by a twentieth century poet. While her work can be shocking in 
its rage and trauma, Plath casts her readers as witnesses– not only to the truth of her 
psychological life, but to her astounding ability to express 
what often remains inexpressible.

**Transcript**:
Take a look at this image. What might this be? A frightening monster? Two friendly bears? Or something else entirely? For nearly a century, ten inkblots like these have been used as what seems like an almost 
mystical personality test. Long kept confidential for psychologists 
and their patients, the mysterious images were said to draw
out the workings of a person’s mind. But what can inkblots really tell us, and how does this test work? Invented in the early 20th century 
by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach, the Rorschach Test is actually less about 
the specific things we see, and more about our general approach 
to perception. As an amateur artist Hermann was fascinated by how visual 
perception varies from person to person. He carried this interest to 
medical school, where he learned all our senses 
are deeply connected. He studied how our process of perception 
doesn’t just register sensory inputs, but transforms them. And when he started working at a 
mental hospital in eastern Switzerland, he began designing a series 
of puzzling images to gain new insight into this 
enigmatic process. Using his inkblot paintings, Rorschach began quizzing hundreds 
of healthy subjects and psychiatric patients with 
the same question: what might this be? However, it wasn’t what the test subjects 
saw that was most important to Rorschach, but rather, how they approached the task. Which parts of the image did they 
focus on or ignore? Did they see the image moving? Did the color on some inkblots help them 
give better answers, or distract and overwhelm them? He developed a system to code 
people’s responses, reducing the wide range of interpretations
to a few manageable numbers. Now he had empirical measures to quantify 
all kinds of test takers: the creative and imaginative, the detail-oriented, the 
big-picture perceivers, and flexible participants able 
to adapt their approach. Some people would get stuck, offering the same answer 
for multiple blots. Others gave unusual and 
delightful descriptions. Responses were as varied as the inkblots, which offered different kinds of 
perceptual problems– some easier to interpret than others. But analyzing the test-taker’s 
overall approach yielded real insights into 
their psychology. And as Rorschach tested more 
and more people, patterns began to pile up. Healthy subjects with the same 
personalities often took remarkably similar approaches. Patients suffering from the same 
mental illnesses also performed similarly, making the test a reliable 
diagnostic tool. It could even diagnose some conditions difficult to pinpoint with other 
available methods. In 1921, Rorschach published his coding system 
alongside the ten blots he felt gave the most nuanced picture of people’s
perceptual approach. Over the next several decades, the test became wildly popular in 
countries around the world. By the 1960s, it had been officially administered 
millions of times in the U.S. alone. Unfortunately, less than a year after 
publishing the test, Hermann Rorschach had died suddenly. Without its inventor to keep it on track, the test he had methodically gathered 
so much data to support began to be used in all sorts 
of speculative ways. Researchers gave the test 
to Nazi war criminals, hoping to unlock the psychological roots 
of mass murder. Anthropologists showed the images to 
remote communities as a sort of universal personality test. Employers made prejudiced hiring decisions
based on reductive decoding charts. As the test left clinics and entered 
popular culture its reputation among medical 
professionals plummeted, and the blots began to fall 
out of clinical use. Today, the test is still controversial, and many people assume 
it has been disproven. But a massive 2013 review of all the 
existing Rorschach research showed that when administered properly 
the test yields valid results, which can help diagnose mental illness or round out a patient’s 
psychological profile. It’s hardly a stand-alone key 
to the human mind– no test is. But its visual approach and lack 
of any single right answer continue to help psychologists paint
a more nuanced picture of how people see the world. Bringing us one step closer to understanding the patterns 
behind our perceptions.

**Transcript**:
Take a look at this image. What might this be? A frightening monster? Two friendly bears? Or something else entirely? For nearly a century, ten inkblots like these have been used as what seems like an almost 
mystical personality test. Long kept confidential for psychologists 
and their patients, the mysterious images were said to draw
out the workings of a person’s mind. But what can inkblots really tell us, and how does this test work? Invented in the early 20th century 
by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach, the Rorschach Test is actually less about 
the specific things we see, and more about our general approach 
to perception. As an amateur artist Hermann was fascinated by how visual 
perception varies from person to person. He carried this interest to 
medical school, where he learned all our senses 
are deeply connected. He studied how our process of perception 
doesn’t just register sensory inputs, but transforms them. And when he started working at a 
mental hospital in eastern Switzerland, he began designing a series 
of puzzling images to gain new insight into this 
enigmatic process. Using his inkblot paintings, Rorschach began quizzing hundreds 
of healthy subjects and psychiatric patients with 
the same question: what might this be? However, it wasn’t what the test subjects 
saw that was most important to Rorschach, but rather, how they approached the task. Which parts of the image did they 
focus on or ignore? Did they see the image moving? Did the color on some inkblots help them 
give better answers, or distract and overwhelm them? He developed a system to code 
people’s responses, reducing the wide range of interpretations
to a few manageable numbers. Now he had empirical measures to quantify 
all kinds of test takers: the creative and imaginative, the detail-oriented, the 
big-picture perceivers, and flexible participants able 
to adapt their approach. Some people would get stuck, offering the same answer 
for multiple blots. Others gave unusual and 
delightful descriptions. Responses were as varied as the inkblots, which offered different kinds of 
perceptual problems– some easier to interpret than others. But analyzing the test-taker’s 
overall approach yielded real insights into 
their psychology. And as Rorschach tested more 
and more people, patterns began to pile up. Healthy subjects with the same 
personalities often took remarkably similar approaches. Patients suffering from the same 
mental illnesses also performed similarly, making the test a reliable 
diagnostic tool. It could even diagnose some conditions difficult to pinpoint with other 
available methods. In 1921, Rorschach published his coding system 
alongside the ten blots he felt gave the most nuanced picture of people’s
perceptual approach. Over the next several decades, the test became wildly popular in 
countries around the world. By the 1960s, it had been officially administered 
millions of times in the U.S. alone. Unfortunately, less than a year after 
publishing the test, Hermann Rorschach had died suddenly. Without its inventor to keep it on track, the test he had methodically gathered 
so much data to support began to be used in all sorts 
of speculative ways. Researchers gave the test 
to Nazi war criminals, hoping to unlock the psychological roots 
of mass murder. Anthropologists showed the images to 
remote communities as a sort of universal personality test. Employers made prejudiced hiring decisions
based on reductive decoding charts. As the test left clinics and entered 
popular culture its reputation among medical 
professionals plummeted, and the blots began to fall 
out of clinical use. Today, the test is still controversial, and many people assume 
it has been disproven. But a massive 2013 review of all the 
existing Rorschach research showed that when administered properly 
the test yields valid results, which can help diagnose mental illness or round out a patient’s 
psychological profile. It’s hardly a stand-alone key 
to the human mind– no test is. But its visual approach and lack 
of any single right answer continue to help psychologists paint
a more nuanced picture of how people see the world. Bringing us one step closer to understanding the patterns 
behind our perceptions.

**Transcript**:
Your timing made you and your partner the most infamous bank robbers 
in the west. Now, you’ll need to use that timing 
to help you break out of jail. At the appointed time, you’ll be walking 
in the yard near the electric fence. Your partner will flash you the signal, and exactly 45 seconds later, short out the fence circuit. It’ll automatically restart 
after a second or two, but as long as you move fast, you’ll be home free. And then you notice, to your horror, that your watch is broken, and there’s no time to fix it. The signal is coming, and if you make even a small mistake 
in counting off 45 seconds, you’ll get fried. Searching your pockets, you find something that might help: a lighter and two fuses you made earlier 
in the prison work program. Each fuse is a length of flammable twine, built to be lit on either end 
and burn for precisely one minute. The problem is that even though 
the fuses look uniform, they don’t burn evenly, so if you cut one in half, for example, one side might burn longer than the other. Your partner is going to give 
the signal any minute, and you’ll have to make your move. How can you use the fuses and lighter 
to time exactly 45 seconds? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The length of the fuse may 
not tell you anything, but you do know the fuses take exactly
60 seconds to burn from end to end. Here’s the key insight: If you start a fuse on one side 
and it burns for 30 seconds, there’ll still be 30 seconds of fuse left. If you had started it from the other end, it would’ve reached the exact 
same spot in thirty seconds. That means that if you lit it 
from both ends simultaneously, it would burn out in precisely 30 seconds. But how will you time the last fifteen? That’ll have to come from the second fuse. If it were a 30 second fuse, you’d be able to use that same trick again to double the burning speed and 
make it last exactly 15 seconds. And, you realize, you can 
shorten the second fuse by lighting one end of it at the same time
as you light the first. At the moment the first burns out, you’ll be left with 30 seconds 
on the second fuse. Just when you’ve got this all figured out, you see the signal from your partner, and spring into action. You gather the four ends of the two 
fuses and light three of them. The moment the first burns out, you light the other end 
of the second fuse. When it flickers and dies, you know that exactly 45 
seconds have passed, and the electric fence is dead. By the time it hiccups back to life, you’re over the fence and home free.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 12, Ground Truth Question 5, Matched Generated Question 30
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Your timing made you and your partner the most infamous bank robbers 
in the west. Now, you’ll need to use that timing 
to help you break out of jail. At the appointed time, you’ll be walking 
in the yard near the electric fence. Your partner will flash you the signal, and exactly 45 seconds later, short out the fence circuit. It’ll automatically restart 
after a second or two, but as long as you move fast, you’ll be home free. And then you notice, to your horror, that your watch is broken, and there’s no time to fix it. The signal is coming, and if you make even a small mistake 
in counting off 45 seconds, you’ll get fried. Searching your pockets, you find something that might help: a lighter and two fuses you made earlier 
in the prison work program. Each fuse is a length of flammable twine, built to be lit on either end 
and burn for precisely one minute. The problem is that even though 
the fuses look uniform, they don’t burn evenly, so if you cut one in half, for example, one side might burn longer than the other. Your partner is going to give 
the signal any minute, and you’ll have to make your move. How can you use the fuses and lighter 
to time exactly 45 seconds? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The length of the fuse may 
not tell you anything, but you do know the fuses take exactly
60 seconds to burn from end to end. Here’s the key insight: If you start a fuse on one side 
and it burns for 30 seconds, there’ll still be 30 seconds of fuse left. If you had started it from the other end, it would’ve reached the exact 
same spot in thirty seconds. That means that if you lit it 
from both ends simultaneously, it would burn out in precisely 30 seconds. But how will you time the last fifteen? That’ll have to come from the second fuse. If it were a 30 second fuse, you’d be able to use that same trick again to double the burning speed and 
make it last exactly 15 seconds. And, you realize, you can 
shorten the second fuse by lighting one end of it at the same time
as you light the first. At the moment the first burns out, you’ll be left with 30 seconds 
on the second fuse. Just when you’ve got this all figured out, you see the signal from your partner, and spring into action. You gather the four ends of the two 
fuses and light three of them. The moment the first burns out, you light the other end 
of the second fuse. When it flickers and dies, you know that exactly 45 
seconds have passed, and the electric fence is dead. By the time it hiccups back to life, you’re over the fence and home free.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We know about our universe’s past: the Big Bang theory predicts that all 
matter, time, and space began in an incredibly tiny, compact 
state about 14 billion years ago. And we know about the present: scientists’ observations of the movement 
of galaxies tell us that the universe is expanding 
at an accelerated rate. But what about the future? Do we know how our universe 
is going to end? Cosmologists have three 
possible answers for this question, called the Big Freeze, the Big Rip and the Big Crunch. To understand these three scenarios, imagine two objects representing galaxies. A short, tight rubber band is 
holding them together— that’s the attractive force of gravity. Meanwhile, two hooks are 
pulling them apart— that’s the repulsive force 
expanding the universe. Copy this system over and over again, and you have something 
approximating the real universe. The outcome of the battle between 
these two opposing forces determines how the end of the 
universe will play out. The Big Freeze scenario is what happens 
if the force pulling the objects apart is just strong enough to stretch the 
rubber band until it loses its elasticity. The expansion wouldn’t be able to 
accelerate anymore, but the universe would keep 
getting bigger. Clusters of galaxies would separate. The objects within the galaxies– suns, planets, and solar systems would move away from each other, until galaxies dissolved into 
lonely objects floating separately in the vast space. The light they emit would be redshifted 
to long wavelengths with very low, faint energies, and the gas emanating from them 
would be too thin to create new stars. The universe would become 
darker and colder, approaching a frozen state also known as the Big Chill, or the Heat Death of the Universe. But what if the repulsive force 
is so strong that it stretches the rubber band 
past its elastic limit, and actually tears it? If the expansion of the universe 
continues to accelerate, it will eventually overcome not only 
the gravitational force – tearing apart galaxies and solar systems– but also the electromagnetic, weak, 
and strong nuclear forces which hold atoms and nuclei together. As a result, the matter that makes up stars 
breaks into tiny pieces. Even atoms and subatomic particles 
will be destroyed. That’s the Big Rip. What about the third scenario, where the rubber band wins out? That corresponds to a possible future in which the force of gravity brings the 
universe’s expansion to a halt— and then reverses it. Galaxies would start rushing 
towards each other, and as they clumped together their gravitational pull would 
get even stronger. Stars too would hurtle 
together and collide. Temperatures would rise as space 
would get tighter and tighter. The size of the universe would plummet until everything compressed into such 
a small space that even atoms and subatomic particles 
would have to crunch together. The result would be an incredibly dense,
hot, compact universe — a lot like the state that 
preceded the Big Bang. This is the Big Crunch. Could this tiny point of matter explode 
in another Big Bang? Could the universe expand and contract
over and over again, repeating its entire history? The theory describing such a universe 
is known as the Big Bounce. In fact, there’s no way to tell how many 
bounces could’ve already happened— or how many might happen in the future. Each bounce would wipe away any record
of the universe’s previous history. Which one of those scenarios 
will be the real one? The answer depends on the exact shape 
of the universe, the amount of dark energy it holds, and changes in its expansion rate. As of now, our observations suggest 
that we’re heading for a Big Freeze. But the good news is that we’ve probably 
got about 10 to the 100th power years before the chill sets in — so don’t start stocking up 
on mittens just yet.

would get tighter and tighter. The size of the universe would plummet until everything compressed into such 
a small space that even atoms and subatomic particles 
would have to crunch together. The result would be an incredibly dense,
hot, compact universe — a lot like the state that 
preceded the Big Bang. This is the Big Crunch. Could this tiny point of matter explode 
in another Big Bang? Could the universe expand and contract
over and over again, repeating its entire history? The theory describing such a universe 
is known as the Big Bounce. In fact, there’s no way to tell how many 
bounces could’ve already happened— or how many might happen in the future. Each bounce would wipe away any record
of the universe’s previous history. Which one of those scenarios 
will be the real one? The answer depends on the exact shape 
of the universe, the amount of dark energy it holds, and changes in its expansion rate. As of now, our observations suggest 
that we’re heading for a Big Freeze. But the good news is that we’ve probably 
got about 10 to the 100th power years before the chill sets in — so don’t start stocking up 
on mittens just yet.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We know about our universe’s past: the Big Bang theory predicts that all 
matter, time, and space began in an incredibly tiny, compact 
state about 14 billion years ago. And we know about the present: scientists’ observations of the movement 
of galaxies tell us that the universe is expanding 
at an accelerated rate. But what about the future? Do we know how our universe 
is going to end? Cosmologists have three 
possible answers for this question, called the Big Freeze, the Big Rip and the Big Crunch. To understand these three scenarios, imagine two objects representing galaxies. A short, tight rubber band is 
holding them together— that’s the attractive force of gravity. Meanwhile, two hooks are 
pulling them apart— that’s the repulsive force 
expanding the universe. Copy this system over and over again, and you have something 
approximating the real universe. The outcome of the battle between 
these two opposing forces determines how the end of the 
universe will play out. The Big Freeze scenario is what happens 
if the force pulling the objects apart is just strong enough to stretch the 
rubber band until it loses its elasticity. The expansion wouldn’t be able to 
accelerate anymore, but the universe would keep 
getting bigger. Clusters of galaxies would separate. The objects within the galaxies– suns, planets, and solar systems would move away from each other, until galaxies dissolved into 
lonely objects floating separately in the vast space. The light they emit would be redshifted 
to long wavelengths with very low, faint energies, and the gas emanating from them 
would be too thin to create new stars. The universe would become 
darker and colder, approaching a frozen state also known as the Big Chill, or the Heat Death of the Universe. But what if the repulsive force 
is so strong that it stretches the rubber band 
past its elastic limit, and actually tears it? If the expansion of the universe 
continues to accelerate, it will eventually overcome not only 
the gravitational force – tearing apart galaxies and solar systems– but also the electromagnetic, weak, 
and strong nuclear forces which hold atoms and nuclei together. As a result, the matter that makes up stars 
breaks into tiny pieces. Even atoms and subatomic particles 
will be destroyed. That’s the Big Rip. What about the third scenario, where the rubber band wins out? That corresponds to a possible future in which the force of gravity brings the 
universe’s expansion to a halt— and then reverses it. Galaxies would start rushing 
towards each other, and as they clumped together their gravitational pull would 
get even stronger. Stars too would hurtle 
together and collide. Temperatures would rise as space 
would get tighter and tighter. The size of the universe would plummet until everything compressed into such 
a small space that even atoms and subatomic particles 
would have to crunch together. The result would be an incredibly dense,
hot, compact universe — a lot like the state that 
preceded the Big Bang. This is the Big Crunch. Could this tiny point of matter explode 
in another Big Bang? Could the universe expand and contract

**Transcript**:
Here are two images of a house. There’s one obvious difference, but to this patient, P.S., they looked completely identical. P.S. had suffered a stroke that 
damaged the right side of her brain, leaving her unaware of everything 
on her left side. But though she could discern no difference
between the houses, when researchers asked her 
which she would prefer to live in, she chose the house that wasn’t burning— not once, but again and again. P.S.’s brain was still processing 
information from her whole field of vision. She could see both images and tell the difference between them, she just didn’t know it. If someone threw a ball at her left side, she might duck. But she wouldn’t have any 
awareness of the ball, or any idea why she ducked. P.S.’s condition, known as hemispatial neglect, reveals an important distinction between 
the brain’s processing of information and our experience of that processing. That experience is what 
we call consciousness. We are conscious of both the external 
world and our internal selves— we are aware of an image in much the same way we are aware of 
ourselves looking at an image, or our inner thoughts and emotions. But where does consciousness come from? Scientists, theologians, and philosophers have been trying to get to the bottom of 
this question for centuries— without reaching any consensus. One recent theory is that consciousness is the brain’s imperfect 
picture of its own activity. To understand this theory, it helps to have a clear idea of one important way the brain processes 
information from our senses. Based on sensory input, it builds models, which are continuously updating,
simplified descriptions of objects and events in the world. Everything we know is based 
on these models. They never capture every detail of 
the things they describe, just enough for the brain to determine 
appropriate responses. For instance, one model built deep 
into the visual system codes white light as brightness 
without color. In reality, white light includes wavelengths that correspond to all the 
different colors we can see. Our perception of white light is wrong 
and oversimplified, but good enough for us to function. Likewise, the brain’s model of the 
physical body keeps track of the configuration 
of our limbs, but not of individual cells 
or even muscles, because that level of information 
isn’t needed to plan movement. If it didn’t have the model keeping track 
of the body’s size, shape, and how it is moving at any moment, we would quickly injure ourselves. The brain also needs models of itself. For example, the brain has the ability to pay attention
to specific objects and events. It also controls that focus, shifting it from one thing to another, internal and external, according to our needs. Without the ability to direct our focus, we wouldn’t be able to assess threats, 
finish a meal, or function at all. To control focus effectively, the brain has to construct a model 
of its own attention. With 86 billion neurons constantly 
interacting with each other, there’s no way the brain’s model of its 
own information processing can be perfectly self-descriptive. But like the model of the body, or our conception of white light, it doesn’t have to be. Our certainty that we have a 
metaphysical, subjective experience may come from one of the brain’s models, a cut-corner description of what it means
to process information in a focused and deep manner. Scientists have already begun trying 
to figure out how the brain creates that self model. MRI studies are a promising avenue 
for pinpointing the networks involved. These studies compare patterns 
of neural activation when someone is and isn’t conscious 
of a sensory stimulus, like an image. The results show that the areas needed 
for visual processing are activated whether or not the 
participant is aware of the image, but a whole additional network lights up only when they are conscious 
of seeing the image. Patients with hemispatial neglect, 
like P.S., typically have damage to one particular 
part of this network. More extensive damage to the network 
can sometimes lead to a vegetative state, with no sign of consciousness. Evidence like this brings us closer 
to understanding how consciousness is built into the brain, but there’s still much more to learn. For instance, the way neurons in the networks 
related to consciousness compute specific pieces of information is outside the scope of our 
current technology. As we approach questions of consciousness 
with science, we’ll open new lines of inquiry 
into human identity.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Here are two images of a house. There’s one obvious difference, but to this patient, P.S., they looked completely identical. P.S. had suffered a stroke that 
damaged the right side of her brain, leaving her unaware of everything 
on her left side. But though she could discern no difference
between the houses, when researchers asked her 
which she would prefer to live in, she chose the house that wasn’t burning— not once, but again and again. P.S.’s brain was still processing 
information from her whole field of vision. She could see both images and tell the difference between them, she just didn’t know it. If someone threw a ball at her left side, she might duck. But she wouldn’t have any 
awareness of the ball, or any idea why she ducked. P.S.’s condition, known as hemispatial neglect, reveals an important distinction between 
the brain’s processing of information and our experience of that processing. That experience is what 
we call consciousness. We are conscious of both the external 
world and our internal selves— we are aware of an image in much the same way we are aware of 
ourselves looking at an image, or our inner thoughts and emotions. But where does consciousness come from? Scientists, theologians, and philosophers have been trying to get to the bottom of 
this question for centuries— without reaching any consensus. One recent theory is that consciousness is the brain’s imperfect 
picture of its own activity. To understand this theory, it helps to have a clear idea of one important way the brain processes 
information from our senses. Based on sensory input, it builds models, which are continuously updating,
simplified descriptions of objects and events in the world. Everything we know is based 
on these models. They never capture every detail of 
the things they describe, just enough for the brain to determine 
appropriate responses. For instance, one model built deep 
into the visual system codes white light as brightness 
without color. In reality, white light includes wavelengths that correspond to all the 
different colors we can see. Our perception of white light is wrong 
and oversimplified, but good enough for us to function. Likewise, the brain’s model of the 
physical body keeps track of the configuration 
of our limbs, but not of individual cells 
or even muscles, because that level of information 
isn’t needed to plan movement. If it didn’t have the model keeping track 
of the body’s size, shape, and how it is moving at any moment, we would quickly injure ourselves. The brain also needs models of itself. For example, the brain has the ability to pay attention
to specific objects and events. It also controls that focus, shifting it from one thing to another, internal and external, according to our needs. Without the ability to direct our focus, we wouldn’t be able to assess threats, 
finish a meal, or function at all. To control focus effectively, the brain has to construct a model 
of its own attention. With 86 billion neurons constantly 
interacting with each other, there’s no way the brain’s model of its 
own information processing can be perfectly self-descriptive. But like the model of the body, or our conception of white light, it doesn’t have to be. Our certainty that we have a 
metaphysical, subjective experience may come from one of the brain’s models, a cut-corner description of what it means
to process information in a focused and deep manner. Scientists have already begun trying 
to figure out how the brain creates that self model. MRI studies are a promising avenue 
for pinpointing the networks involved. These studies compare patterns 
of neural activation when someone is and isn’t conscious 
of a sensory stimulus, like an image. The results show that the areas needed 
for visual processing are activated whether or not the 
participant is aware of the image, but a whole additional network lights up only when they are conscious 
of seeing the image. Patients with hemispatial neglect, 
like P.S., typically have damage to one particular 
part of this network. More extensive damage to the network 
can sometimes lead to a vegetative state, with no sign of consciousness. Evidence like this brings us closer 
to understanding how consciousness is built into the brain, but there’s still much more to learn. For instance, the way neurons in the networks 
related to consciousness compute specific pieces of information is outside the scope of our 
current technology. As we approach questions of consciousness 
with science, we’ll open new lines of inquiry 
into human identity.

**Transcript**:
Claps of thunder and flashes of lightning
illuminate a swelling sea, as a ship buckles beneath the waves.  This is no ordinary storm, 
but a violent and vengeful tempest, and it sets the stage for Shakespeare’s
most enigmatic play. As the skies clear, 
we are invited into a world that seems far removed from our own,
but is rife with familiar concerns about freedom, power, and control. The Tempest is set on a desert island,
exposed to the elements and ruled with magic and might by 
Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan. Betrayed by his brother Antonio, 
Prospero has been marooned on the island for twelve years with his daughter Miranda
and his beloved books. In this time he’s learned the 
magic of the island and uses it to harness its 
elementary spirits. He also rules over the island’s
only earthly inhabitant, the dejected and demonized Caliban. But after years of plotting revenge,
Prospero’s foe is finally in sight. With the help of the 
fluttering sprite Ariel, the magician destroys his brother’s ship
and washes its sailors ashore. Prospero’s plotting even extends to his
daughter’s love life, whom he plans to fall for 
stranded prince Ferdinand. And as Prospero and Ariel
close in on Antonio, Caliban joins forces with some 
drunken sailors, who hatch a comic plot 
to take the island. The play strips society down
to its basest desires, with each faction in hot pursuit of power-
be it over the land, other people, or their own destiny. But Shakespeare knows that power is
always a moving target; and as he reveals
these characters’ dark histories, we begin to wonder if this
vicious cycle will ever end. Although Prospero was wronged by Antonio, he has long inflicted his
own abuses on the island, hoarding its magical properties
and natural re-sources for himself. Caliban especially resents
this takeover. The son of Sycorax, a witch who previously
ruled the island, he initially helped the 
exiles find their footing. But he’s since become their slave,
and rants with furious regret: “And then I loved thee,/
And showed thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle/
The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place 
and fertile./ Cursed be I that did so!” With his thunderous language
and seething anger, Caliban constantly reminds
Prospero of what came before: this island’s mine by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me. Yet Sycorax also abused the island, and imprisoned Ariel until 
Prospero released him. Now Ariel spends the play hoping to repay
his debt and earn his freedom, while Caliban is enslaved indefinitely,
or at least as long as Prospero is in charge. For these reasons and many more, The Tempest has often been read as
an exploration of colonialism, and the moral dilemmas that come
with en-counters of “brave new world(s)." Questions of agency and justice
hang over the play: is Caliban the rightful 
master of the land? Will Ariel flutter free?  And is Prospero the 
mighty overseer- or is there some deeper magic at work,
beyond any one character's grasp? Throughout the play, Ariel constantly reminds Prospero
of the freedom he is owed. But the question lingers of whether
the invader will be able to relinquish his grip. The question of ending one’s reign is
particularly potent given that The Tempest is believed to be 
Shakespeare’s final play. In many ways Prospero’s actions echo that
of the great entertainer him-self, who hatched elaborate plots,
maneuvered those around him, and cast a spell over characters
and audience alike. But by the end of his grand performance
of power and control, Prospero’s final lines see him humbled
by his audience - and the power
that they hold over his creations. "With the help of your good hands./
Gentle breath of yours my sails/ Must fill or else my project fails,/
Which was to please." This evokes Shakespeare’s own role
as the great entertainer who surrenders himself,
ultimately, to our applause.

**Transcript**:
Claps of thunder and flashes of lightning
illuminate a swelling sea, as a ship buckles beneath the waves.  This is no ordinary storm, 
but a violent and vengeful tempest, and it sets the stage for Shakespeare’s
most enigmatic play. As the skies clear, 
we are invited into a world that seems far removed from our own,
but is rife with familiar concerns about freedom, power, and control. The Tempest is set on a desert island,
exposed to the elements and ruled with magic and might by 
Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan. Betrayed by his brother Antonio, 
Prospero has been marooned on the island for twelve years with his daughter Miranda
and his beloved books. In this time he’s learned the 
magic of the island and uses it to harness its 
elementary spirits. He also rules over the island’s
only earthly inhabitant, the dejected and demonized Caliban. But after years of plotting revenge,
Prospero’s foe is finally in sight. With the help of the 
fluttering sprite Ariel, the magician destroys his brother’s ship
and washes its sailors ashore. Prospero’s plotting even extends to his
daughter’s love life, whom he plans to fall for 
stranded prince Ferdinand. And as Prospero and Ariel
close in on Antonio, Caliban joins forces with some 
drunken sailors, who hatch a comic plot 
to take the island. The play strips society down
to its basest desires, with each faction in hot pursuit of power-
be it over the land, other people, or their own destiny. But Shakespeare knows that power is
always a moving target; and as he reveals
these characters’ dark histories, we begin to wonder if this
vicious cycle will ever end. Although Prospero was wronged by Antonio, he has long inflicted his
own abuses on the island, hoarding its magical properties
and natural re-sources for himself. Caliban especially resents
this takeover. The son of Sycorax, a witch who previously
ruled the island, he initially helped the 
exiles find their footing. But he’s since become their slave,
and rants with furious regret: “And then I loved thee,/
And showed thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle/
The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place 
and fertile./ Cursed be I that did so!” With his thunderous language
and seething anger, Caliban constantly reminds
Prospero of what came before: this island’s mine by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me. Yet Sycorax also abused the island, and imprisoned Ariel until 
Prospero released him. Now Ariel spends the play hoping to repay
his debt and earn his freedom, while Caliban is enslaved indefinitely,
or at least as long as Prospero is in charge. For these reasons and many more, The Tempest has often been read as
an exploration of colonialism, and the moral dilemmas that come
with en-counters of “brave new world(s)." Questions of agency and justice
hang over the play: is Caliban the rightful 
master of the land? Will Ariel flutter free?  And is Prospero the 
mighty overseer- or is there some deeper magic at work,
beyond any one character's grasp? Throughout the play, Ariel constantly reminds Prospero
of the freedom he is owed. But the question lingers of whether
the invader will be able to relinquish his grip. The question of ending one’s reign is
particularly potent given that The Tempest is believed to be 
Shakespeare’s final play. In many ways Prospero’s actions echo that
of the great entertainer him-self, who hatched elaborate plots,
maneuvered those around him, and cast a spell over characters
and audience alike. But by the end of his grand performance
of power and control, Prospero’s final lines see him humbled
by his audience - and the power
that they hold over his creations. "With the help of your good hands./
Gentle breath of yours my sails/ Must fill or else my project fails,/
Which was to please." This evokes Shakespeare’s own role
as the great entertainer who surrenders himself,
ultimately, to our applause.
