**Transcript**:
85% of the matter in our universe
is a mystery. We don't know what it's made of,
which is why we call it dark matter. But we know it's out there because we
can observe its gravitational attraction on galaxies and other celestial objects. We've yet to directly observe dark matter, but scientists theorize that we may
actually be able to create it in the most powerful particle collider
in the world. That's the 27 kilometer-long
Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, in Geneva, Switzerland. So how would that work? In the LHC, two proton beams
move in opposite directions and are accelerated 
to near the speed of light. At four collision points, the beams cross
and protons smash into each other. Protons are made of much smaller
components called quarks and gluons In most ordinary collisions, the two
protons pass through each other without any significant outcome. However, in about 
one in a million collisions, two components hit each other
so violently, that most of the collision energy
is set free producing thousands of new particles. It's only in these collisions that very
massive particles, like the theorized dark matter,
can be produced. The collision points 
are surrounded by detectors containing about 100 million sensors. Like huge three-dimensional cameras, they gather information 
on those new particles, including their trajectory, electrical charge, and energy. Once processed, the computers can depict
a collision as an image. Each line is the path 
of a different particle, and different types of particles
are color-coded. Data from the detectors 
allows scientists to determine what each of these particles is, things like photons and electrons. Now, the detectors take snapshots of about
a billion of these collisions per second to find signs of extremely rare
massive particles. To add to the difficulty, the particles we're looking for 
may be unstable and decay into more familiar particles
before reaching the sensors. Take, for example, the Higgs boson, a long-theorized particle that wasn't
observed until 2012. The odds of a given collision producing
a Higgs boson are about one in 10 billion, and it only lasts for 
a tiny fraction of a second before decaying. But scientists developed theoretical 
models to tell them what to look for. For the Higgs, they thought it would
sometimes decay into two photons. So they first examined only 
the high-energy events that included two photons. But there's a problem here. There are innumerable 
particle interactions that can produce two random photons. So how do you separate out the Higgs
from everything else? The answer is mass. The information gathered by the detectors
allows the scientists to go a step back and determine the mass of whatever it was
that produced two photons. They put that mass value into a graph and then repeat the process
for all events with two photons. The vast majority of these events
are just random photon observations, what scientists call background events. But when a Higgs boson is produced
and decays into two photons, the mass always comes out to be the same. Therefore, the tell-tale sign
of the Higgs boson would be a little bump sitting on top
of the background. It takes billions of observations
before a bump like this can appear, and it's only considered 
a meaningful result if that bump becomes significantly 
higher than the background. In the case of the Higgs boson, the scientists at the LHC announced their
groundbreaking result when there was only 
a one in 3 million chance this bump could have 
appeared by a statistical fluke. So back to the dark matter. If the LHC's proton beams have enough
energy to produce it, that's probably an even rarer occurrence
than the Higgs boson. So it takes quadrillions of collisions
combined with theoretical models to even start to look. That's what the LHC is currently doing. By generating a mountain of data, we're hoping to find more tiny bumps
in graphs that will provide evidence for
yet unknown particles, like dark matter. Or maybe what we'll 
find won't be dark matter, but something else that would reshape our understanding 
of how the universe works entirely. That's part of the fun at this point. We have no idea what we're
going to find.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match.

Although Question 1 does not directly ask what dark matter is made of, it does relate to the unknown nature of dark matter, which is the core idea behind the ground truth MCQ. Question 1 asks about the estimated percentage of matter in the universe that is currently unknown, which is closely related to the concept of dark matter being a mystery.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more closely related to the content of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the provided options directly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say:

 Question 2 is not the correct match, but Question 1 is also not a perfect match. In reality, there is no perfect match.

However, since I must provide an answer:

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, the most similar generated MCQ would be one that discusses the composition or structure of particles.

The closest match is not present, but if I had to choose one, I would say Question 14. It talks about determining the type of particle, which is somewhat related to the composition of a proton.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, and Question 14 is a very loose match.

**Transcript**:
85% of the matter in our universe
is a mystery. We don't know what it's made of,
which is why we call it dark matter. But we know it's out there because we
can observe its gravitational attraction on galaxies and other celestial objects. We've yet to directly observe dark matter, but scientists theorize that we may
actually be able to create it in the most powerful particle collider
in the world. That's the 27 kilometer-long
Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, in Geneva, Switzerland. So how would that work? In the LHC, two proton beams
move in opposite directions and are accelerated 
to near the speed of light. At four collision points, the beams cross
and protons smash into each other. Protons are made of much smaller
components called quarks and gluons In most ordinary collisions, the two
protons pass through each other without any significant outcome. However, in about 
one in a million collisions, two components hit each other
so violently, that most of the collision energy
is set free producing thousands of new particles. It's only in these collisions that very
massive particles, like the theorized dark matter,
can be produced. The collision points 
are surrounded by detectors containing about 100 million sensors. Like huge three-dimensional cameras, they gather information 
on those new particles, including their trajectory, electrical charge, and energy. Once processed, the computers can depict
a collision as an image. Each line is the path 
of a different particle, and different types of particles
are color-coded. Data from the detectors 
allows scientists to determine what each of these particles is, things like photons and electrons. Now, the detectors take snapshots of about
a billion of these collisions per second to find signs of extremely rare
massive particles. To add to the difficulty, the particles we're looking for 
may be unstable and decay into more familiar particles
before reaching the sensors. Take, for example, the Higgs boson, a long-theorized particle that wasn't
observed until 2012. The odds of a given collision producing
a Higgs boson are about one in 10 billion, and it only lasts for 
a tiny fraction of a second before decaying. But scientists developed theoretical 
models to tell them what to look for. For the Higgs, they thought it would
sometimes decay into two photons. So they first examined only 
the high-energy events that included two photons. But there's a problem here. There are innumerable 
particle interactions that can produce two random photons. So how do you separate out the Higgs
from everything else? The answer is mass. The information gathered by the detectors
allows the scientists to go a step back and determine the mass of whatever it was
that produced two photons. They put that mass value into a graph and then repeat the process
for all events with two photons. The vast majority of these events
are just random photon observations, what scientists call background events. But when a Higgs boson is produced
and decays into two photons, the mass always comes out to be the same. Therefore, the tell-tale sign
of the Higgs boson would be a little bump sitting on top
of the background. It takes billions of observations
before a bump like this can appear, and it's only considered 
a meaningful result if that bump becomes significantly 
higher than the background. In the case of the Higgs boson, the scientists at the LHC announced their
groundbreaking result when there was only 
a one in 3 million chance this bump could have 
appeared by a statistical fluke. So back to the dark matter. If the LHC's proton beams have enough
energy to produce it, that's probably an even rarer occurrence
than the Higgs boson. So it takes quadrillions of collisions
combined with theoretical models to even start to look. That's what the LHC is currently doing. By generating a mountain of data, we're hoping to find more tiny bumps
in graphs that will provide evidence for
yet unknown particles, like dark matter. Or maybe what we'll 
find won't be dark matter, but something else that would reshape our understanding 
of how the universe works entirely. That's part of the fun at this point. We have no idea what we're
going to find.

**Transcript**:
In the early hours of August 13, 1961, East German construction workers flanked
by soldiers and police began tearing up streets and erecting
barriers throughout the city of Berlin and its surroundings. This night marked the beginning of one
of history's most infamous dividing lines, the Berlin Wall. Construction on the wall continued
for the next decade as it cut through neighborhoods, separated families, and divided not just Germany,
but the world. To understand how we got to this point, we have to go back to World War II. America, Britain, and France joined forces with the Soviet Union
against the Axis Powers. After they defeated Nazi Germany, each of the victorious nations occupied
part of the country. The division was meant to be temporary, but the former allies found 
themselves at odds over their visions for post-war Europe. While Western powers promoted
liberal market economies, the Soviet Union sought to surround itself
with obedient Communist nations, including a weakened Germany. As their relations deteriorated, the Federal Republic of Germany
was formed in the West while the Soviets established the
German Democratic Republic in the East. The Soviet satellite countries restricted
Western trade and movement, so a virtually impassable border formed. It became known as the Iron Curtain. In the former German capital of Berlin,
things were particularly complicated. Although the city lay fully within
the East German territory of the GDR, the post-war agreement gave the allies
joint administration. So America, Britain, and France created
a Democratic enclave in Berlin's western districts. While East Germans were officially banned
from leaving the country, in Berlin, it was simply 
a matter of walking, or riding a subway, streetcar or bus, to the Western half, then traveling on to West Germany
or beyond. This open border posed a problem
for the East German leadership. They had staked a claim to represent
the Communist resistance against Hitler and portrayed Western Germany as
a continuation of the Nazi regime. While the U.S. and its allies poured
money into West Germany's reconstruction, the Soviet Union extracted resources
from the East as war reparations, making its planned economy 
even less competitive. Life in East Germany passed under
the watchful eye of the Stasi, the secret police whose wiretaps 
and informants monitored citizens for any hint of disloyalty. While there was free health care
and education in the East, the West boasted higher salaries, more consumer goods, and greater personal freedom. By 1961, about 3.5 million people,
nearly 20% of the East German population, had left, 
including many young professionals. To prevent further losses, East Germany decided to close the border,
and that's where the Berlin Wall came in. Extending for 43 kilometers
through Berlin, and a further 112 through East Germany, the initial barrier consisted
of barbed wire and mesh fencing. Some Berliners escaped by
jumping over the wire or leaving from windows, but as the wall expanded,
this became more difficult. By 1965, 106 kilometers of 3.6-meter-high
concrete barricades had been added topped with a smooth 
pipe to prevent climbing. Over the coming years, the barrier
was strengthened with spike strips, guard dogs, and even landmines, along with 302 watchtowers
and 20 bunkers. A parallel fence in the rear set off
a 100-meter area called the death strip. There, all buildings were demolished
and the ground covered with sand to provide a clear line of sight
for the hundreds of guards ordered to shoot anyone 
attempting to cross. Nevertheless, nearly 5,000 people
in total managed to flee East Germany between 1961 and 1989. Some were diplomats or athletes
who defected while abroad, but others were ordinary citizens who
dug tunnels, swam across canals, flew hot air balloons, or even crashed a stolen tank
through the wall. Yet the risk was great. Over 138 people died
while attempting escape. Some shot in full view of West Germans
powerless to help them. The wall stabilized East Germany's economy
by preventing its work force from leaving, but tarnished its reputation, becoming a global symbol 
of Communist repression. As part of reconciliation with the East, the Basic Treaty of 1972 recognized
East Germany pragmatically while West Germany retained its hope
for eventual reunification. Although the Eastern regime
gradually allowed family visits, it tried to discourage people
from exercising these rights with an arduous bureaucratic process
and high fees. Nonetheless, it was still overwhelmed
by applications. By the end of the 1980's, the liberalization of 
other Eastern Bloc regimes caused mass demonstrations
for free travel and demands for democracy. On the evening of November 9, 1989, East Germany tried to defuse tension
by making travel permits easier to obtain. But the announcement brought thousands
of East Berliners to the border crossing points in the wall, forcing the surprised guards to open
the gates immediately. Rejoicing crowds poured into West Berlin as people from both sides danced 
atop the wall. And others began to demolish it 
with whatever tools they could find. Although the border guards initially
tried to maintain order, it was soon clear that the years
of division were at an end. After four decades, Germany was
officially reunified in October 1990. And the Soviet Union fell soon after. Today, parts of the wall still 
stand as a reminder that any barriers we put up 
to impede freedom, we can also break down.

liberal market economies, the Soviet Union sought to surround itself
with obedient Communist nations, including a weakened Germany. As their relations deteriorated, the Federal Republic of Germany
was formed in the West while the Soviets established the
German Democratic Republic in the East. The Soviet satellite countries restricted
Western trade and movement, so a virtually impassable border formed. It became known as the Iron Curtain. In the former German capital of Berlin,
things were particularly complicated. Although the city lay fully within
the East German territory of the GDR, the post-war agreement gave the allies
joint administration. So America, Britain, and France created
a Democratic enclave in Berlin's western districts. While East Germans were officially banned
from leaving the country, in Berlin, it was simply 
a matter of walking, or riding a subway, streetcar or bus, to the Western half, then traveling on to West Germany
or beyond. This open border posed a problem
for the East German leadership. They had staked a claim to represent
the Communist resistance against Hitler and portrayed Western Germany as
a continuation of the Nazi regime. While the U.S. and its allies poured
money into West Germany's reconstruction, the Soviet Union extracted resources
from the East as war reparations, making its planned economy 
even less competitive. Life in East Germany passed under
the watchful eye of the Stasi, the secret police whose wiretaps 
and informants monitored citizens for any hint of disloyalty. While there was free health care
and education in the East, the West boasted higher salaries, more consumer goods, and greater personal freedom. By 1961, about 3.5 million people,
nearly 20% of the East German population, had left, 
including many young professionals. To prevent further losses, East Germany decided to close the border,
and that's where the Berlin Wall came in. Extending for 43 kilometers
through Berlin, and a further 112 through East Germany, the initial barrier consisted
of barbed wire and mesh fencing. Some Berliners escaped by
jumping over the wire or leaving from windows, but as the wall expanded,
this became more difficult. By 1965, 106 kilometers of 3.6-meter-high
concrete barricades had been added topped with a smooth 
pipe to prevent climbing. Over the coming years, the barrier
was strengthened with spike strips, guard dogs, and even landmines, along with 302 watchtowers
and 20 bunkers. A parallel fence in the rear set off
a 100-meter area called the death strip. There, all buildings were demolished
and the ground covered with sand to provide a clear line of sight
for the hundreds of guards ordered to shoot anyone 
attempting to cross. Nevertheless, nearly 5,000 people
in total managed to flee East Germany between 1961 and 1989. Some were diplomats or athletes
who defected while abroad, but others were ordinary citizens who
dug tunnels, swam across canals, flew hot air balloons, or even crashed a stolen tank
through the wall. Yet the risk was great. Over 138 people died
while attempting escape. Some shot in full view of West Germans
powerless to help them. The wall stabilized East Germany's economy
by preventing its work force from leaving, but tarnished its reputation, becoming a global symbol 
of Communist repression. As part of reconciliation with the East, the Basic Treaty of 1972 recognized
East Germany pragmatically while West Germany retained its hope
for eventual reunification. Although the Eastern regime
gradually allowed family visits, it tried to discourage people
from exercising these rights with an arduous bureaucratic process
and high fees. Nonetheless, it was still overwhelmed
by applications. By the end of the 1980's, the liberalization of 
other Eastern Bloc regimes caused mass demonstrations
for free travel and demands for democracy. On the evening of November 9, 1989, East Germany tried to defuse tension
by making travel permits easier to obtain. But the announcement brought thousands
of East Berliners to the border crossing points in the wall, forcing the surprised guards to open
the gates immediately. Rejoicing crowds poured into West Berlin as people from both sides danced 
atop the wall. And others began to demolish it 
with whatever tools they could find. Although the border guards initially
tried to maintain order, it was soon clear that the years
of division were at an end. After four decades, Germany was
officially reunified in October 1990. And the Soviet Union fell soon after. Today, parts of the wall still 
stand as a reminder that any barriers we put up 
to impede freedom, we can also break down.

**Transcript**:
In the early hours of August 13, 1961, East German construction workers flanked
by soldiers and police began tearing up streets and erecting
barriers throughout the city of Berlin and its surroundings. This night marked the beginning of one
of history's most infamous dividing lines, the Berlin Wall. Construction on the wall continued
for the next decade as it cut through neighborhoods, separated families, and divided not just Germany,
but the world. To understand how we got to this point, we have to go back to World War II. America, Britain, and France joined forces with the Soviet Union
against the Axis Powers. After they defeated Nazi Germany, each of the victorious nations occupied
part of the country. The division was meant to be temporary, but the former allies found 
themselves at odds over their visions for post-war Europe. While Western powers promoted

**Transcript**:
A solar eclipse happens when the moon’s
shadow falls somewhere on the surface of Earth And a lunar eclipse is the opposite -- when
the Earth’s shadow falls on the moon The two sections of the shadow, the dark umbra
and the partially shaded penumbra, their placement determines which type of eclipse
we can see from Earth. But not all eclipses are made equal. The most spectacular, the one for your bucket
list is a total eclipse of the sun. A total solar eclipse begins as a partial
eclipse. You’ll notice trees projecting the crescent
sun, and shadows becoming sharper than normal. The landscape darkens to a bluish-grey and
 you’ll start to feel the temperature drop. From the west, the moon’s shadow rushes
toward you like a silent storm. Look up and you’ll see the last sliver of
the sun sparkling like a diamond ring, before it’s broken into a string of beads
by the moon’s rough terrain. Now you can see the pearly glow of the sun’s
corona and the pink and red light from the hydrogen gas of the chromosphere. Together these make up the sun’s outer atmosphere,
and a total solar eclipse is the only occasion you have to lay eyes on it. This is totality and if you get a chance
to see it, you should. The moon orbits earth every 29.5 days, but
we don’t get eclipses every month. That’s because the moon’s orbit is not
in line with earth’s orbit. it’s tilted about 5 degrees. That doesn’t seem like much but keep in
mind that the scale of the model we’re showing to you is way off. If the Earth and moon are this size, the
distance between them should be around 10 ft. At this distance, 5 degrees is enough to keep
the moon’s shadow off of Earth and the Earth’s shadow off the moon most months. So why do we ever get eclipses? Because there are two points where the moon’s
orbit crosses the sun’s plane, called nodes. And as the Earth moves along its annual orbit,
those points line up with the sun about twice a year. As the moon passes between the sun and Earth
at that time, we get a solar eclipse. When it’s behind Earth at that time, we
get a lunar eclipse. There are a ton of orbital quirks that make
predicting eclipses really complicated, but in general we’ll have a few solar and lunar
eclipses of some sort and a few lunar eclipses of some sort every year. But you’re more likely to see a total lunar
eclipse in your lifetime than a total solar one. The totality of a lunar eclipse can last well
over an hour and it’s viewable for anyone on the night side of earth. The moon often turns red during a total lunar
eclipse because our planet’s atmosphere scatters the shorter bluer wavelengths of
light, while the longer, redder wavelengths pass through. Or to put it another way, a total lunar eclipse
projects all of the world’s sunsets and sunrises onto the moon. Total solar eclipses seem much more rare because
totality lasts just a few minutes, and although Earth gets a total solar eclipse every 18
months on average, each one is only viewable by less than half a percent of Earth’s surface. Eclipse chasers travel all over the world
to put themselves in the path of the shadow. In a total solar eclipse, the moon precisely
covers the sun from the vantage point of some place on Earth. This is possible because by coincidence, the
sun and the moon appear to be about the same size in our sky. While the sun is 400 times bigger than the
moon, it’s also about 400 times farther away. But this alignment isn’t constant. the moon has an elliptical orbit. Its size varies about 12% throughout a month. When it’s closer to us, we can get total
solar eclipses, but less than 30% of solar eclipses are total. More often, we get partial eclipses, where
the alignment is a bit off, or annular eclipses, where the moon is too far away to fully block
the sun, leaving a ring of sunlight around the moon. In the far future, earth will only get annular
and partial solar eclipses because our moon is moving further away. We know that because Buzz Aldrin and Neil
Armstrong left mirrors on the moon in 1969. Astronomers bounce lasers off those mirrors
to measure the moon’s distance. And that’s how they found out that the moon
is moving away from Earth by more than 3 cm per year. So in a billion years or so, whatever creatures
live here will witness Earth’s very last total solar eclipse. “We can see on the Radio One screen, a fantastic
total solar eclipse taken from the pictures above the clouds.” “This is just fantastic.” A lot of early civilizations feared eclipses. They were often seen as an attack on the sun

**Transcript**:
A solar eclipse happens when the moon’s
shadow falls somewhere on the surface of Earth And a lunar eclipse is the opposite -- when
the Earth’s shadow falls on the moon The two sections of the shadow, the dark umbra
and the partially shaded penumbra, their placement determines which type of eclipse
we can see from Earth. But not all eclipses are made equal. The most spectacular, the one for your bucket
list is a total eclipse of the sun. A total solar eclipse begins as a partial
eclipse. You’ll notice trees projecting the crescent
sun, and shadows becoming sharper than normal. The landscape darkens to a bluish-grey and
 you’ll start to feel the temperature drop. From the west, the moon’s shadow rushes
toward you like a silent storm. Look up and you’ll see the last sliver of
the sun sparkling like a diamond ring, before it’s broken into a string of beads
by the moon’s rough terrain. Now you can see the pearly glow of the sun’s
corona and the pink and red light from the hydrogen gas of the chromosphere. Together these make up the sun’s outer atmosphere,
and a total solar eclipse is the only occasion you have to lay eyes on it. This is totality and if you get a chance
to see it, you should. The moon orbits earth every 29.5 days, but
we don’t get eclipses every month. That’s because the moon’s orbit is not
in line with earth’s orbit. it’s tilted about 5 degrees. That doesn’t seem like much but keep in
mind that the scale of the model we’re showing to you is way off. If the Earth and moon are this size, the
distance between them should be around 10 ft. At this distance, 5 degrees is enough to keep
the moon’s shadow off of Earth and the Earth’s shadow off the moon most months. So why do we ever get eclipses? Because there are two points where the moon’s
orbit crosses the sun’s plane, called nodes. And as the Earth moves along its annual orbit,
those points line up with the sun about twice a year. As the moon passes between the sun and Earth
at that time, we get a solar eclipse. When it’s behind Earth at that time, we
get a lunar eclipse. There are a ton of orbital quirks that make
predicting eclipses really complicated, but in general we’ll have a few solar and lunar
eclipses of some sort and a few lunar eclipses of some sort every year. But you’re more likely to see a total lunar
eclipse in your lifetime than a total solar one. The totality of a lunar eclipse can last well
over an hour and it’s viewable for anyone on the night side of earth. The moon often turns red during a total lunar
eclipse because our planet’s atmosphere scatters the shorter bluer wavelengths of
light, while the longer, redder wavelengths pass through. Or to put it another way, a total lunar eclipse
projects all of the world’s sunsets and sunrises onto the moon. Total solar eclipses seem much more rare because
totality lasts just a few minutes, and although Earth gets a total solar eclipse every 18
months on average, each one is only viewable by less than half a percent of Earth’s surface. Eclipse chasers travel all over the world
to put themselves in the path of the shadow. In a total solar eclipse, the moon precisely
covers the sun from the vantage point of some place on Earth. This is possible because by coincidence, the
sun and the moon appear to be about the same size in our sky. While the sun is 400 times bigger than the
moon, it’s also about 400 times farther away. But this alignment isn’t constant. the moon has an elliptical orbit. Its size varies about 12% throughout a month. When it’s closer to us, we can get total
solar eclipses, but less than 30% of solar eclipses are total. More often, we get partial eclipses, where
the alignment is a bit off, or annular eclipses, where the moon is too far away to fully block
the sun, leaving a ring of sunlight around the moon. In the far future, earth will only get annular
and partial solar eclipses because our moon is moving further away. We know that because Buzz Aldrin and Neil
Armstrong left mirrors on the moon in 1969. Astronomers bounce lasers off those mirrors
to measure the moon’s distance. And that’s how they found out that the moon
is moving away from Earth by more than 3 cm per year. So in a billion years or so, whatever creatures
live here will witness Earth’s very last total solar eclipse. “We can see on the Radio One screen, a fantastic
total solar eclipse taken from the pictures above the clouds.” “This is just fantastic.” A lot of early civilizations feared eclipses. They were often seen as an attack on the sun
or moon by the forces of darkness. But now that we understand our place in space,
eclipses are an occasion for awe, and for gratitude. All over the galaxy rocks are casting shadows

**Transcript**:
Fish are in trouble. The cod population off Canada's East Coast
collapsed in the 1990s, intense recreational 
and commercial fishing has decimated goliath grouper populations
in South Florida, and most populations of tuna
have plummeted by over 50%, with the Southern Atlantic bluefin
on the verge of extinction. Those are just a couple of many examples. Overfishing is happening 
all over the world. How did this happen? When some people think of fishing, they imagine relaxing in a boat
and patiently reeling in the day's catch. But modern industrial fishing,
the kind that stocks our grocery shelves, looks more like warfare. In fact, the technologies they employ
were developed for war. Radar, sonar, helicopters, and spotter planes are all used to guide factory ships
towards dwindling schools of fish. Long lines with hundreds
of hooks or huge nets round up massive amounts of fish,
along with other species, like seabirds, turtles, and dolphins. And fish are hauled up onto giant boats, complete with onboard flash freezing
and processing facilities. All of these technologies have enabled
us to catch fish at greater depths and farther out at sea than ever before. And as the distance and depth
of fishing have expanded, so has the variety of species we target. For example, the Patagonian toothfish
neither sounds nor looks very appetizing. And fishermen ignored it until
the late 1970s. Then it was rebranded and marketed
to chefs in the U.S. as Chilean sea bass, despite the animal actually 
being a type of cod. Soon it was popping up in markets
all over the world and is now a delicacy. Unfortunately, these deep water fish 
don't reproduce until they're at least ten years old, making them extremely vulnerable
to overfishing when the young are caught before they've
had the chance to spawn. Consumer taste and prices can
also have harmful effects. For example, shark fin soup is considered
such a delicacy in China and Vietnam that the fin has become 
the most profitable part of the shark. This leads many fishermen to fill
their boats with fins leaving millions of dead sharks behind. The problems aren't unique
to toothfish and sharks. Almost 31% of the world's fish populations
are overfished, and another 58% are fished
at the maximum sustainable level. Wild fish simply can't reproduce
as fast as 7 billion people can eat them. Fishing also has impacts
on broader ecosystems. Wild shrimp are typically caught by
dragging nets the size of a football field along the ocean bottom, disrupting or destroying
seafloor habitats. The catch is often as little as 5% shrimp. The rest is by-catch, unwanted 
animals that are thrown back dead. And coastal shrimp farming isn't
much better. Mangroves are bulldozed to make room
for shrimp farms, robbing coastal communities of storm
protection and natural water filtration and depriving fish of key
nursery habitats. So what does it look like to give
fish a break and let them recover? Protection can take many forms. In national waters,
governments can set limits about how, when, where, 
and how much fishing occurs, with restrictions on certain 
boats and equipment. Harmful practices, such as bottom 
trawling, can be banned altogether, and we can establish marine reserves
closed to all fishing to help ecosystems restore themselves. There's also a role for consumer awareness
and boycotts to reduce wasteful practices, like shark finning, and push fishing industries towards
more sustainable practices. Past interventions have successfully
helped depleted fish populations recover. There are many solutions. The best approach for each fishery
must be considered based on science, respect for the local communities
that rely on the ocean, and for fish as wild animals. And then the rules must be enforced. International collaboration is often
needed, too, because fish don't care about our borders. We need to end overfishing. Ecosystems, food security, jobs, economies, and coastal cultures all depend on it.

**Transcript**:
Fish are in trouble. The cod population off Canada's East Coast
collapsed in the 1990s, intense recreational 
and commercial fishing has decimated goliath grouper populations
in South Florida, and most populations of tuna
have plummeted by over 50%, with the Southern Atlantic bluefin
on the verge of extinction. Those are just a couple of many examples. Overfishing is happening 
all over the world. How did this happen? When some people think of fishing, they imagine relaxing in a boat
and patiently reeling in the day's catch. But modern industrial fishing,
the kind that stocks our grocery shelves, looks more like warfare. In fact, the technologies they employ
were developed for war. Radar, sonar, helicopters, and spotter planes are all used to guide factory ships
towards dwindling schools of fish. Long lines with hundreds
of hooks or huge nets round up massive amounts of fish,
along with other species, like seabirds, turtles, and dolphins. And fish are hauled up onto giant boats, complete with onboard flash freezing
and processing facilities. All of these technologies have enabled
us to catch fish at greater depths and farther out at sea than ever before. And as the distance and depth
of fishing have expanded, so has the variety of species we target. For example, the Patagonian toothfish
neither sounds nor looks very appetizing. And fishermen ignored it until
the late 1970s. Then it was rebranded and marketed
to chefs in the U.S. as Chilean sea bass, despite the animal actually 
being a type of cod. Soon it was popping up in markets
all over the world and is now a delicacy. Unfortunately, these deep water fish 
don't reproduce until they're at least ten years old, making them extremely vulnerable
to overfishing when the young are caught before they've
had the chance to spawn. Consumer taste and prices can
also have harmful effects. For example, shark fin soup is considered
such a delicacy in China and Vietnam that the fin has become 
the most profitable part of the shark. This leads many fishermen to fill
their boats with fins leaving millions of dead sharks behind. The problems aren't unique

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to water treatment and access to clean water, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about the vulnerability of Chilean seabass to overfishing.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match. This is because Question 3 has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ, with multiple options and a correct answer that involves selecting a combination of factors.

But again, I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3 (although it's not a good match)

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 5, Question 1
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Take a look at the water in this glass. Refreshing, hydrating, and invaluable
to your survival. Before you take a sip, though, how do you know that the water inside
is free from disease-causing organisms and pollutants? One out of ten people in the world
can't actually be sure that their water is clean 
and safe to drink. Why is that? Inadequate sanitation, poor protection of drinking water sources, and improper hygiene often lead to sewage 
and feces-contaminated water. That's the ideal breeding ground
for dangerous bacteria, viruses, and parasites. And the effects of these pathogens
are staggering. Diarrheal disease from unsafe water is one
of the leading causes of death around the world for children under five. And according to a U.N. report from 2010, microbial water-borne illnesses killed
more people per year than war. Proper treatment processes, though,
can address these threats. They usually have three parts: sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. Once water has been collected
in a treatment facility, it's ready for cleaning. The first step, sedimentation,
just takes time. The water sits undisturbed, allowing
heavier particles to sink to the bottom. Often, though, particles 
are just too small to be removed by sedimentation alone and need to be filtered. Gravity pulls the water downward through
layers of sand that catch leftover particles 
in their pores, prepping the water 
for its final treatment, a dose of disinfectant. Chemicals, primarily forms 
of chlorine and ozone, are mixed in to kill off any pathogens and to disinfect pipes 
and storage systems. Chlorine is highly effective in destroying
water's living organisms, but its use remains government-regulated because it has potentially harmful
chemical byproducts. And if an imbalance of chlorine occurs
during the disinfection process, it can trigger other chemical reactions. For example, 
levels of chlorine byproducts, like trihalomethanes, could skyrocket,
leading to pipe corrosion and the release of iron, copper,
and lead into drinking water. Water contamination from these
and other sources including leaching, chemical spills, and runoffs, has been linked 
to long-term health effects, like cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and miscarriage. Unfortunately, analyzing the exact risks of chemically contaminated 
water is difficult. So while it's clear that disinfectants
make us safer by removing disease-causing pathogens, experts have yet 
to determine the full scope of how the chemical cocktail 
in our drinking water really impacts human health. So how can you tell whether the water
you have access to, whether from a tap or otherwise, is drinkable? Firstly, too much turbidity, trace organic compounds, or high-density heavy metals like arsenic,
chromium, or lead, mean that the water 
is unsuitable for consumption. A lot of contaminants, 
like lead or arsenic, won't be obvious without tests, but some clues, like cloudiness, brown or yellow coloration, a foul odor, or an excessive chlorine smell can indicate the need 
to investigate further. Water testing kits can go a step further and confirm the presence of many different
contaminants and chemicals. With many types of contamination, there are ways of treating water where 
it's used instead of close to its source. Point-of-use treatment has actually
been around for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians boiled away many
organic contaminants with the sun's heat. And in Ancient Greece, Hippocrates
designed a bag that trapped bad tasting 
sediments from water. Today, point-of-use processes usually
involve ionization to lower mineral content. They also use adsorption filtration, where a porous material
called activated carbon strains the water to remove contaminants
and chemical byproducts. While it's not always an effective
long-term solution, point-of-use treatment is portable,
easy to install, and adaptable. And in regions where large-scale
systems are unavailable, or where water has been contaminated
further along its journey, these systems can mean the difference
between life and death. Clean water remains a precious
and often scarce commodity. There are nearly 800 million of us who
still don't have regular access to it. The good news is that continued
developments in water treatment, both on a large and small scale, can alleviate a lot of unsafe conditions. Implementing proper systems where
they're needed and paying careful attention
to the ones already in place will fulfill one of the most basic
of our human needs.

**Transcript**:
Take a look at the water in this glass. Refreshing, hydrating, and invaluable
to your survival. Before you take a sip, though, how do you know that the water inside
is free from disease-causing organisms and pollutants? One out of ten people in the world
can't actually be sure that their water is clean 
and safe to drink. Why is that? Inadequate sanitation, poor protection of drinking water sources, and improper hygiene often lead to sewage 
and feces-contaminated water. That's the ideal breeding ground
for dangerous bacteria, viruses, and parasites. And the effects of these pathogens
are staggering. Diarrheal disease from unsafe water is one
of the leading causes of death around the world for children under five. And according to a U.N. report from 2010, microbial water-borne illnesses killed
more people per year than war. Proper treatment processes, though,
can address these threats. They usually have three parts: sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. Once water has been collected
in a treatment facility, it's ready for cleaning. The first step, sedimentation,
just takes time. The water sits undisturbed, allowing
heavier particles to sink to the bottom. Often, though, particles 
are just too small to be removed by sedimentation alone and need to be filtered. Gravity pulls the water downward through
layers of sand that catch leftover particles 
in their pores, prepping the water 
for its final treatment, a dose of disinfectant. Chemicals, primarily forms 
of chlorine and ozone, are mixed in to kill off any pathogens and to disinfect pipes 
and storage systems. Chlorine is highly effective in destroying
water's living organisms, but its use remains government-regulated because it has potentially harmful
chemical byproducts. And if an imbalance of chlorine occurs
during the disinfection process, it can trigger other chemical reactions. For example, 
levels of chlorine byproducts, like trihalomethanes, could skyrocket,
leading to pipe corrosion and the release of iron, copper,
and lead into drinking water. Water contamination from these
and other sources including leaching, chemical spills, and runoffs, has been linked 
to long-term health effects, like cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and miscarriage. Unfortunately, analyzing the exact risks of chemically contaminated 
water is difficult. So while it's clear that disinfectants
make us safer by removing disease-causing pathogens, experts have yet 
to determine the full scope of how the chemical cocktail 
in our drinking water really impacts human health. So how can you tell whether the water
you have access to, whether from a tap or otherwise, is drinkable? Firstly, too much turbidity, trace organic compounds, or high-density heavy metals like arsenic,
chromium, or lead, mean that the water 
is unsuitable for consumption. A lot of contaminants, 
like lead or arsenic, won't be obvious without tests, but some clues, like cloudiness, brown or yellow coloration, a foul odor, or an excessive chlorine smell can indicate the need 
to investigate further. Water testing kits can go a step further and confirm the presence of many different
contaminants and chemicals. With many types of contamination, there are ways of treating water where 
it's used instead of close to its source. Point-of-use treatment has actually
been around for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians boiled away many
organic contaminants with the sun's heat. And in Ancient Greece, Hippocrates
designed a bag that trapped bad tasting 
sediments from water. Today, point-of-use processes usually
involve ionization to lower mineral content. They also use adsorption filtration, where a porous material
called activated carbon strains the water to remove contaminants
and chemical byproducts. While it's not always an effective
long-term solution, point-of-use treatment is portable,
easy to install, and adaptable. And in regions where large-scale
systems are unavailable, or where water has been contaminated
further along its journey, these systems can mean the difference
between life and death. Clean water remains a precious
and often scarce commodity. There are nearly 800 million of us who
still don't have regular access to it. The good news is that continued
developments in water treatment, both on a large and small scale, can alleviate a lot of unsafe conditions. Implementing proper systems where
they're needed and paying careful attention
to the ones already in place will fulfill one of the most basic
of our human needs.

**Transcript**:
Let’s face it. Butterflies get all the glory, fluttering
around with their flashy looks. But caterpillars? They’re more than just an awkward adolescent
phase. They do all the hard work, so that one day
they can look like this. As adults, butterflies really only have one
job: mating. They’re basically flying reproduction machines,
powered by sugar water. Their proboscis is made for sipping nectar. But that liquid diet doesn’t give them much
of the protein they need to make eggs. So that hungry, hungry caterpillar has a big
job to do. It’s not just eating for itself. It’s stockpiling the protein it will need
later on to make the next generation. It starts by eating its way out of the egg. No leftovers. Then it’s onto the main course. These pipevine swallowtail caterpillars are
chowing down on their favorite – and only – food: the pipevine. For a monarch caterpillar, it’s all about
the milkweed. In two weeks they’ll grow 20 times longer. That’s like a human baby growing as tall
as a three-story building. A caterpillar can’t see very well. So it uses antennae to smell for food. Not those big ones on top – those are for
feeling around. It’s the tiny ones right down there. It eats and eats and eats… storing up as
much protein as possible. Leaves are about one quarter protein. After packing on the pounds for a couple of
weeks, this monarch caterpillar is finally ready for the big day. It weaves a ball of silk on a branch. Then, it hooks onto it – with its backside. And lets go. Look through its skin. There’s something wiggling in there. The caterpillar pumps and pushes. Until… it splits open… shedding all traces of its youth… including its face. The outer skin hardens into the chrysalis
that protects the pupa inside. Its stomach shrinks. It’s giving up its gluttonous ways. When the butterfly emerges days later, it
uncurls its brand new proboscis – two pieces called galeae that have to be zipped together
into a single straw before the butterfly can use it. And it lets those glorious wings unfold. They’ll take it to find mates and a juicy
new plant to lay its eggs on, using that stored up protein. This complete metamorphosis is called holometaboly. Multiple lives in a single life. It takes a lot of work. And butterflies only live a few weeks. But this strategy is not as rare as you might
think. In the animal kingdom, it’s incredibly common. Mammals like us are the weird ones. After all, our face doesn't fall off when
we grow up. Hey! It’s Lauren. Can you spot the chrysalises hanging on this
branch? They need that camouflage. Otherwise they’d be sitting ducks for predators. Are you looking for something new? Try Above the Noise, a new series from KQED
and PBS Digital Studios that cuts through the hype of today’s headlines, with science. See you next time!

**Transcript**:
Let’s face it. Butterflies get all the glory, fluttering
around with their flashy looks. But caterpillars? They’re more than just an awkward adolescent
phase. They do all the hard work, so that one day
they can look like this. As adults, butterflies really only have one
job: mating. They’re basically flying reproduction machines,
powered by sugar water. Their proboscis is made for sipping nectar. But that liquid diet doesn’t give them much
of the protein they need to make eggs. So that hungry, hungry caterpillar has a big
job to do. It’s not just eating for itself. It’s stockpiling the protein it will need
later on to make the next generation. It starts by eating its way out of the egg. No leftovers. Then it’s onto the main course. These pipevine swallowtail caterpillars are
chowing down on their favorite – and only – food: the pipevine. For a monarch caterpillar, it’s all about
the milkweed. In two weeks they’ll grow 20 times longer. That’s like a human baby growing as tall
as a three-story building. A caterpillar can’t see very well. So it uses antennae to smell for food. Not those big ones on top – those are for
feeling around. It’s the tiny ones right down there. It eats and eats and eats… storing up as
much protein as possible. Leaves are about one quarter protein. After packing on the pounds for a couple of
weeks, this monarch caterpillar is finally ready for the big day. It weaves a ball of silk on a branch. Then, it hooks onto it – with its backside. And lets go. Look through its skin. There’s something wiggling in there. The caterpillar pumps and pushes. Until… it splits open… shedding all traces of its youth… including its face. The outer skin hardens into the chrysalis
that protects the pupa inside. Its stomach shrinks. It’s giving up its gluttonous ways. When the butterfly emerges days later, it
uncurls its brand new proboscis – two pieces called galeae that have to be zipped together
into a single straw before the butterfly can use it. And it lets those glorious wings unfold. They’ll take it to find mates and a juicy
new plant to lay its eggs on, using that stored up protein. This complete metamorphosis is called holometaboly. Multiple lives in a single life. It takes a lot of work. And butterflies only live a few weeks. But this strategy is not as rare as you might
think. In the animal kingdom, it’s incredibly common. Mammals like us are the weird ones. After all, our face doesn't fall off when
we grow up. Hey! It’s Lauren. Can you spot the chrysalises hanging on this
branch? They need that camouflage. Otherwise they’d be sitting ducks for predators. Are you looking for something new? Try Above the Noise, a new series from KQED
and PBS Digital Studios that cuts through the hype of today’s headlines, with science. See you next time!

**Transcript**:
Is teleportation possible? Could a baseball transform into
something like a radio wave, travel through buildings, bounce around corners, and change back into a baseball? Oddly enough, thanks to quantum mechanics,
the answer might actually be yes. Sort of. Here's the trick. The baseball itself couldn't 
be sent by radio, but all the information about it could. In quantum physics, atoms and electrons are interpreted as a collection
of distinct properties, for example, position, momentum, and intrinsic spin. The values of these properties 
configure the particle, giving it a quantum state identity. If two electrons have 
the same quantum state, they're identical. In a literal sense, our baseball
is defined by a collective quantum state resulting from its many atoms. If this quantum state information
could be read in Boston and sent around the world, atoms for the same chemical elements
could have this information imprinted on them in Bangalore and be carefully directed to assemble, becoming the exact same baseball. There's a wrinkle though. Quantum states aren't so easy to measure. The uncertainty principle 
in quantum physics implies the position and momentum
of a particle can't be measured at the same time. The simplest way to measure
the exact position of an electron requires scattering a particle of light,
a photon, from it, and collecting the light in a microscope. But that scattering changes the momentum
of the electron in an unpredictable way. We lose all previous information
about momentum. In a sense, 
quantum information is fragile. Measuring the information changes it. So how can we transmit something we're not permitted to fully read
without destroying it? The answer can be found in the strange
phenomena of quantum entanglement. Entanglement is an old mystery
from the early days of quantum physics and it's still not entirely understood. Entangling the spin of two electrons
results in an influence that transcends distance. Measuring the spin of the first electron determines what spin will 
measure for the second, whether the two particles are a mile
or a light year apart. Somehow, information 
about the first electron's quantum state, called a qubit of data, influences its partner without 
transmission across the intervening space. Einstein and his colleagues called
this strange communcation spooky action at a distance. While it does seem that entanglement
between two particles helps transfer a qubit instantaneously
across the space between them, there's a catch. This interaction must begin locally. The two electrons must be entangled
in close proximity before one of them is transported
to a new site. By itself, quantum entanglement
isn't teleportation. To complete the teleport, we need a digital message to help
interpret the qubit at the receiving end. Two bits of data created by measuring
the first particle. These digital bits must be transmitted
by a classical channel that's limited by the speed of light,
radio, microwaves, or perhaps fiberoptics. When we measure a particle
for this digital message, we destroy its quantum information, which means the baseball must disappear
from Boston for it to teleport to Bangalore. Thanks to the uncertainty principle, teleportation transfers the information
about the baseball between the two cities
and never duplicates it. So in principle, we could teleport 
objects, even people, but at present, it seems unlikely
we can measure the quantum states of the trillion trillion or more atoms
in large objects and then recreate them elsewhere. The complexity of this task
and the energy needed is astronomical. For now, we can reliably teleport
single electrons and atoms, which may lead to super-secured
data encryption for future quantum computers. The philosophical implications
of quantum teleportation are subtle. A teleported object doesn't exactly
transport across space like tangible matter, nor does it exactly transmit across space,
like intangible information. It seems to do a little of both. Quantum physics gives us 
a strange new vision for all the matter in our universe
as collections of fragile information. And quantum teleportation reveals
new ways to influence this fragility. And remember, never say never. In a little over a century, mankind has advanced from an uncertain 
new understanding of the behavior of electrons
at the atomic scale to reliably teleporting them
across a room. What new technical mastery 
of such phenomena might we have in 1,000,

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, such as data compression, sequences, and Conway's Constant, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to quantum physics and the definition of a quantum state.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 5: **Synthesis** is the closest match. This question has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ, with a question and multiple options, but the content and intent of the question are not similar.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say Question 5: **Synthesis** is the closest match, although it is still not similar in terms of content and intent.

Index: 5 (Note: This is not a good match, and a new set of generated MCQs that are related to quantum physics and the definition of a quantum state would be needed to find a good match.)

**Transcript**:
Is teleportation possible? Could a baseball transform into
something like a radio wave, travel through buildings, bounce around corners, and change back into a baseball? Oddly enough, thanks to quantum mechanics,
the answer might actually be yes. Sort of. Here's the trick. The baseball itself couldn't 
be sent by radio, but all the information about it could. In quantum physics, atoms and electrons are interpreted as a collection
of distinct properties, for example, position, momentum, and intrinsic spin. The values of these properties 
configure the particle, giving it a quantum state identity. If two electrons have 
the same quantum state, they're identical. In a literal sense, our baseball
is defined by a collective quantum state resulting from its many atoms. If this quantum state information
could be read in Boston and sent around the world, atoms for the same chemical elements
could have this information imprinted on them in Bangalore and be carefully directed to assemble, becoming the exact same baseball. There's a wrinkle though. Quantum states aren't so easy to measure. The uncertainty principle 
in quantum physics implies the position and momentum
of a particle can't be measured at the same time. The simplest way to measure
the exact position of an electron requires scattering a particle of light,
a photon, from it, and collecting the light in a microscope. But that scattering changes the momentum
of the electron in an unpredictable way. We lose all previous information
about momentum. In a sense, 
quantum information is fragile. Measuring the information changes it. So how can we transmit something we're not permitted to fully read
without destroying it? The answer can be found in the strange
phenomena of quantum entanglement. Entanglement is an old mystery
from the early days of quantum physics and it's still not entirely understood. Entangling the spin of two electrons
results in an influence that transcends distance. Measuring the spin of the first electron determines what spin will 
measure for the second, whether the two particles are a mile
or a light year apart. Somehow, information 
about the first electron's quantum state, called a qubit of data, influences its partner without 
transmission across the intervening space. Einstein and his colleagues called
this strange communcation spooky action at a distance. While it does seem that entanglement
between two particles helps transfer a qubit instantaneously
across the space between them, there's a catch. This interaction must begin locally. The two electrons must be entangled
in close proximity before one of them is transported
to a new site. By itself, quantum entanglement
isn't teleportation. To complete the teleport, we need a digital message to help
interpret the qubit at the receiving end. Two bits of data created by measuring
the first particle. These digital bits must be transmitted
by a classical channel that's limited by the speed of light,
radio, microwaves, or perhaps fiberoptics. When we measure a particle
for this digital message, we destroy its quantum information, which means the baseball must disappear
from Boston for it to teleport to Bangalore. Thanks to the uncertainty principle, teleportation transfers the information

could have this information imprinted on them in Bangalore and be carefully directed to assemble, becoming the exact same baseball. There's a wrinkle though. Quantum states aren't so easy to measure. The uncertainty principle 
in quantum physics implies the position and momentum
of a particle can't be measured at the same time. The simplest way to measure
the exact position of an electron requires scattering a particle of light,
a photon, from it, and collecting the light in a microscope. But that scattering changes the momentum
of the electron in an unpredictable way. We lose all previous information
about momentum. In a sense, 
quantum information is fragile. Measuring the information changes it. So how can we transmit something we're not permitted to fully read
without destroying it? The answer can be found in the strange
phenomena of quantum entanglement. Entanglement is an old mystery
from the early days of quantum physics and it's still not entirely understood. Entangling the spin of two electrons
results in an influence that transcends distance. Measuring the spin of the first electron determines what spin will 
measure for the second, whether the two particles are a mile
or a light year apart. Somehow, information 
about the first electron's quantum state, called a qubit of data, influences its partner without 
transmission across the intervening space. Einstein and his colleagues called
this strange communcation spooky action at a distance. While it does seem that entanglement
between two particles helps transfer a qubit instantaneously
across the space between them, there's a catch. This interaction must begin locally. The two electrons must be entangled
in close proximity before one of them is transported
to a new site. By itself, quantum entanglement
isn't teleportation. To complete the teleport, we need a digital message to help
interpret the qubit at the receiving end. Two bits of data created by measuring
the first particle. These digital bits must be transmitted
by a classical channel that's limited by the speed of light,
radio, microwaves, or perhaps fiberoptics. When we measure a particle
for this digital message, we destroy its quantum information, which means the baseball must disappear
from Boston for it to teleport to Bangalore. Thanks to the uncertainty principle, teleportation transfers the information
about the baseball between the two cities
and never duplicates it. So in principle, we could teleport 
objects, even people, but at present, it seems unlikely
we can measure the quantum states of the trillion trillion or more atoms
in large objects and then recreate them elsewhere. The complexity of this task
and the energy needed is astronomical. For now, we can reliably teleport
single electrons and atoms, which may lead to super-secured
data encryption for future quantum computers. The philosophical implications
of quantum teleportation are subtle. A teleported object doesn't exactly
transport across space like tangible matter, nor does it exactly transmit across space,
like intangible information. It seems to do a little of both. Quantum physics gives us 
a strange new vision for all the matter in our universe
as collections of fragile information. And quantum teleportation reveals
new ways to influence this fragility. And remember, never say never. In a little over a century, mankind has advanced from an uncertain 
new understanding of the behavior of electrons
at the atomic scale to reliably teleporting them
across a room. What new technical mastery 
of such phenomena might we have in 1,000, 
or even 10,000 years? Only time and space will tell.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, although it is still not a good match.

Index: None of the generated MCQs are a good match.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but only because it mentions a concept related to data and information transfer, which is tangentially related to the concept of quantum teleportation. However, the question intent, options, and content are still not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically designed to match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. 

Here is an example of a generated MCQ that could be a good match:

**Transcript**:
These are the first five elements
of a number sequence. Can you figure out what comes next? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 There is a pattern here, but it may not be the kind
of pattern you think it is. Look at the sequence again
and try reading it aloud. Now, look at the next number
in the sequence. 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1. Pause again if you'd like to think
about it some more. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This is what's known as
a look and say sequence. Unlike many number sequences, this relies not on some mathematical
property of the numbers themselves, but on their notation. Start with the left-most digit
of the initial number. Now, read out how many times 
it repeats in succession followed by the name of the digit itself. Then move on to the next distinct digit
and repeat until you reach the end. So the number 1 is read as "one one" written down the same way 
we write eleven. Of course, as part of this sequence,
it's not actually the number eleven, but 2 ones, which we then write as 2 1. That number is then read out
as 1 2 1 1, which written out we'd read as
one one, one two, two ones, and so on. These kinds of sequences were first
analyzed by mathematician John Conway, who noted they have 
some interesting properties. For instance, starting with the number 22,
yields an infinite loop of two twos. But when seeded with any other number, the sequence grows in some
very specific ways. Notice that although the number
of digits keeps increasing, the increase doesn't seem
to be either linear or random. In fact, if you extend the sequence
infinitely, a pattern emerges. The ratio between the amount of digits
in two consecutive terms gradually converges to a single number
known as Conway's Constant. This is equal to a little over 1.3, meaning that the amount of digits
increases by about 30% with every step in the sequence. What about the numbers themselves? That gets even more interesting. Except for the repeating sequence of 22, every possible sequence eventually breaks
down into distinct strings of digits. No matter what order these strings
show up in, each appears unbroken in its entirety
every time it occurs. Conway identified 92 of these elements, all composed only of digits 1, 2, and 3, as well as two additional elements whose variations
can end with any digit of 4 or greater. No matter what number the sequence
is seeded with, eventually, it'll just consist
of these combinations, with digits 4 or higher only appearing
at the end of the two extra elements, if at all. Beyond being a neat puzzle, the look and say sequence
has some practical applications. For example, run-length encoding, a data compression that was once used for
television signals and digital graphics, is based on a similar concept. The amount of times a data value repeats
within the code is recorded as a data value itself. Sequences like this are a good example
of how numbers and other symbols can convey meaning on multiple levels.

**Transcript**:
These are the first five elements
of a number sequence. Can you figure out what comes next? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 There is a pattern here, but it may not be the kind
of pattern you think it is. Look at the sequence again
and try reading it aloud. Now, look at the next number
in the sequence. 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1. Pause again if you'd like to think
about it some more. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This is what's known as
a look and say sequence. Unlike many number sequences, this relies not on some mathematical
property of the numbers themselves, but on their notation. Start with the left-most digit
of the initial number. Now, read out how many times 
it repeats in succession followed by the name of the digit itself. Then move on to the next distinct digit
and repeat until you reach the end. So the number 1 is read as "one one" written down the same way 
we write eleven. Of course, as part of this sequence,
it's not actually the number eleven, but 2 ones, which we then write as 2 1. That number is then read out
as 1 2 1 1, which written out we'd read as
one one, one two, two ones, and so on. These kinds of sequences were first
analyzed by mathematician John Conway, who noted they have 
some interesting properties. For instance, starting with the number 22,
yields an infinite loop of two twos. But when seeded with any other number, the sequence grows in some
very specific ways. Notice that although the number
of digits keeps increasing, the increase doesn't seem
to be either linear or random. In fact, if you extend the sequence
infinitely, a pattern emerges. The ratio between the amount of digits
in two consecutive terms gradually converges to a single number
known as Conway's Constant. This is equal to a little over 1.3, meaning that the amount of digits
increases by about 30% with every step in the sequence. What about the numbers themselves? That gets even more interesting. Except for the repeating sequence of 22, every possible sequence eventually breaks
down into distinct strings of digits. No matter what order these strings
show up in, each appears unbroken in its entirety
every time it occurs. Conway identified 92 of these elements, all composed only of digits 1, 2, and 3, as well as two additional elements whose variations
can end with any digit of 4 or greater. No matter what number the sequence
is seeded with, eventually, it'll just consist
of these combinations, with digits 4 or higher only appearing
at the end of the two extra elements, if at all. Beyond being a neat puzzle, the look and say sequence
has some practical applications. For example, run-length encoding, a data compression that was once used for
television signals and digital graphics, is based on a similar concept. The amount of times a data value repeats
within the code is recorded as a data value itself. Sequences like this are a good example
of how numbers and other symbols can convey meaning on multiple levels.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Deep underground lies stores of once
inaccessible natural gas. This gas was likely formed 
over millions of years as layers of decaying organisms
were exposed to intense heat and pressure under the Earth's crust. There's a technology called
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that can extract this natural gas, potentially powering us
for decades to come. So how does fracking work, and why it is a source 
of such heated controversy? A fracking site can be anywhere
with natural gas, from a remote desert to several hundred feet
from your backyard. It starts out with a long vertical hole
known as a wellbore drilled down through layers of sediment. When the well reaches 2500 - 3000 meters,
it's at its kickoff point where it can begin the process
of horizontal drilling. It turns 90 degrees and extends
horizontally for about 1.5 kilometers through a compressed black layer
called the shale rock formation. A specialized perforating gun
is then lowered and fired, creating a series of small, 
inch-long holes that burst through the well's casing
into the rock layer. About three to four months
after the initial drilling, the well is ready for fracking to begin. Fracking fluid is pumped down
into the well at a pressure so high, it cracks the shale rock, creating fractures through which
the trapped gas and oil can escape. The fluid itself is more than 90% water. The rest is made up of concentrated
chemical additives. These vary depending on the specific
characteristics of the fracking site, but usually fall into three categories: acids for clearing debris
and dissolving minerals, friction-reducing compounds to create a slippery form of water 
known as slickwater, and disinfectant to prevent
bacteria growth. Sand or clay is also mixed into
the water to prop open the fissures so the gas and oil can keep leaking out,
even after the pressure is released. It's estimated that all of fracking's
intense pumping and flushing uses an average of 3-6 million gallons
of water per well. That's actually not a lot compared
to agriculture, power plants, or even golf course maintenance, but it can have a notable impact
on local water supply. And disposing of used fracking water
is also an issue. Along with the trapped gas
that's pumped up to the surface, millions of gallons of flow-back liquid
come gushing up. This liquid containing contaminants
like radioactive material, salts, heavy metals, and hydrocarbons, needs to be stored and disposed of. That's usually done in pits on-site
in deep wells or off-site at water treatment facilities. Another option is to recycle
the flow-back liquid, but the recycling process can actually
increase levels of contamination since the water is more toxic
with each use. Wells are typically encased 
in steel and cement to prevent contaminants from leaking
into groundwater. But any negligence 
or fracking-related accidents can have devastating effects. Fracturing directly 
into underground water hazardous underground 
seepage and leakage, and inadequate treatment and disposal
of highly-toxic waste water can potentially contaminate
drinking water around a fracking site. There's also concern about
the threat of earthquakes and damaged infrastructure from pressure 
and waste water injection. Links between fracking
and increased seismic activity leave unresolved questions
about long-term pressure imbalances that might be happening
deep beneath our feet. Fracking's biggest controversy, though,
is happening above the ground. The general consensus is that burning
natural gas is better for the environment than burning coal since the gas collected from fracking emits only half 
the carbon dioxide as coal per unit of energy. The pollution caused 
by the fracking itself, though, isn't negligible. Methane that leaks out during the drilling
and pumping process is many times more potent
than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. Some scientists argue that methane
eventually dissipates, so has a relatively low long-term impact. But a greater question hangs in the air. Does fracking take time,
money, and research away from the development
of cleaner renewable energy sources? Natural gas is non-renewable, and the short-run economic interests
supporting fracking may fall short in the face
of global climate change. Experts are still examining
fracking's overarching effects. Although modern fracking has been
around since the 1940s, it's boomed in the last few decades. As other sources of natural gas decrease,
the costs of non-renewable energies rise, and cutting-edge technologies
make it so accessible. But many countries and regions
have already banned fracking in response to environmental concerns. It's undeniable that fracking has reshaped
the energy landscape around the world, but for what long-term benefit
and at what cost?

**Transcript**:
Deep underground lies stores of once
inaccessible natural gas. This gas was likely formed 
over millions of years as layers of decaying organisms
were exposed to intense heat and pressure under the Earth's crust. There's a technology called
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that can extract this natural gas, potentially powering us
for decades to come. So how does fracking work, and why it is a source 
of such heated controversy? A fracking site can be anywhere
with natural gas, from a remote desert to several hundred feet
from your backyard. It starts out with a long vertical hole
known as a wellbore drilled down through layers of sediment. When the well reaches 2500 - 3000 meters,
it's at its kickoff point where it can begin the process
of horizontal drilling. It turns 90 degrees and extends
horizontally for about 1.5 kilometers through a compressed black layer
called the shale rock formation. A specialized perforating gun
is then lowered and fired, creating a series of small, 
inch-long holes that burst through the well's casing
into the rock layer. About three to four months
after the initial drilling, the well is ready for fracking to begin. Fracking fluid is pumped down
into the well at a pressure so high, it cracks the shale rock, creating fractures through which
the trapped gas and oil can escape. The fluid itself is more than 90% water. The rest is made up of concentrated
chemical additives. These vary depending on the specific
characteristics of the fracking site, but usually fall into three categories: acids for clearing debris
and dissolving minerals, friction-reducing compounds to create a slippery form of water 
known as slickwater, and disinfectant to prevent
bacteria growth. Sand or clay is also mixed into
the water to prop open the fissures so the gas and oil can keep leaking out,
even after the pressure is released. It's estimated that all of fracking's
intense pumping and flushing uses an average of 3-6 million gallons
of water per well. That's actually not a lot compared
to agriculture, power plants, or even golf course maintenance, but it can have a notable impact
on local water supply. And disposing of used fracking water
is also an issue. Along with the trapped gas
that's pumped up to the surface, millions of gallons of flow-back liquid
come gushing up. This liquid containing contaminants
like radioactive material, salts, heavy metals, and hydrocarbons, needs to be stored and disposed of. That's usually done in pits on-site
in deep wells or off-site at water treatment facilities. Another option is to recycle
the flow-back liquid, but the recycling process can actually
increase levels of contamination since the water is more toxic
with each use. Wells are typically encased 
in steel and cement to prevent contaminants from leaking
into groundwater. But any negligence 
or fracking-related accidents can have devastating effects. Fracturing directly 
into underground water hazardous underground 
seepage and leakage, and inadequate treatment and disposal
of highly-toxic waste water can potentially contaminate
drinking water around a fracking site. There's also concern about
the threat of earthquakes and damaged infrastructure from pressure 
and waste water injection. Links between fracking
and increased seismic activity leave unresolved questions
about long-term pressure imbalances that might be happening
deep beneath our feet. Fracking's biggest controversy, though,
is happening above the ground. The general consensus is that burning
natural gas is better for the environment than burning coal since the gas collected from fracking emits only half 
the carbon dioxide as coal per unit of energy. The pollution caused 
by the fracking itself, though, isn't negligible. Methane that leaks out during the drilling
and pumping process is many times more potent
than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. Some scientists argue that methane
eventually dissipates, so has a relatively low long-term impact. But a greater question hangs in the air. Does fracking take time,
money, and research away from the development
of cleaner renewable energy sources? Natural gas is non-renewable, and the short-run economic interests
supporting fracking may fall short in the face
of global climate change. Experts are still examining
fracking's overarching effects. Although modern fracking has been
around since the 1940s, it's boomed in the last few decades. As other sources of natural gas decrease,
the costs of non-renewable energies rise, and cutting-edge technologies
make it so accessible. But many countries and regions
have already banned fracking in response to environmental concerns. It's undeniable that fracking has reshaped
the energy landscape around the world, but for what long-term benefit
and at what cost?

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can tell you that the generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, which is design and psychology.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new set of MCQs based on the provided transcript about fracking, and then I can help you identify the one that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

Alternatively, I can assist you in creating a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. Please let me know how I can further assist you.

However, if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that none of them match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one based on the fact that it asks about a quantity, I would say:

 Question 5 is not a match, but it does ask about a result, which is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ that asks about an estimated amount.

Please keep in mind that this is a very weak match and not a good one.

Again, I apologize for not being able to find a good match. If you'd like, I can try to generate new MCQs or assist you in creating one that matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Cats are obsessed with staying clean. They can spend up to half their waking hours
grooming. Their tongue is covered in tiny spines. They’re what makes the tongue feel so sandpapery. These spines, called papillae, are made of
keratin, just like their claws and our fingernails. The papillae even look like miniature cat
claws. They do an impeccable job of detangling their
fur. Researchers at Georgia Tech made a 3D model
of a cat’s tongue… to test how it works. See how the fur just peels off? It’s because the spines are all angled in
the same direction. With a typical hairbrush, you’d have to
pick the fur out from between the bristles. So why are cats so preoccupied with grooming? For them, it’s about more than just vanity. For one thing, it’s a way to show affection--
to build bonds. That’s why they appreciate us petting them. And it spreads out oils produced by the cat’s
skin that gives their fur some water resistance. But when it really comes down to it, for cats,
staying clean is a matter of life and death. Cats are carnivores… ambush predators. They hide and sneak up on their unsuspecting
prey. One whiff of the wrong odor could give the
cat away. But when they pounce, it’s their bite that
finishes the job. Cats have extra-wide mouths so they can get
their teeth around their prey’s neck. It would be like having the corners of your
mouth go all the way back by your ears. But there’s a tradeoff that comes with that
big bite. Those wide mouths mean their lips can’t
come together to form a good seal. They can’t create suction to drink the way
we do. So, they flick the water with the tip of their
tongue Researchers at MIT made a model using a glass
disc, to show how cats get a drink by just barely touching the water’s surface. The water sticks to the disc and to itself. Lift the disc at the right speed and it pulls
the water up into a column. Then, the cat bites it at precisely the right
moment to get as much water as possible. And all of this happens four times per second! It’s a complicated way to take a drink,
but it’s just one of prices cats pay to be the expert predators they are… Hey guys, It’s Lauren. You know you love fuzzy critters. So check out our other episodes like this
one. See what you can learn about a squirrel's
mood just by looking at its tail. Or how the fuzziness of owl feathers makes
them such stealthy hunters. And if you like the show, share us! Thanks for watching.

**Transcript**:
Cats are obsessed with staying clean. They can spend up to half their waking hours
grooming. Their tongue is covered in tiny spines. They’re what makes the tongue feel so sandpapery. These spines, called papillae, are made of
keratin, just like their claws and our fingernails. The papillae even look like miniature cat
claws. They do an impeccable job of detangling their
fur. Researchers at Georgia Tech made a 3D model
of a cat’s tongue… to test how it works. See how the fur just peels off? It’s because the spines are all angled in
the same direction. With a typical hairbrush, you’d have to
pick the fur out from between the bristles. So why are cats so preoccupied with grooming? For them, it’s about more than just vanity. For one thing, it’s a way to show affection--
to build bonds. That’s why they appreciate us petting them. And it spreads out oils produced by the cat’s
skin that gives their fur some water resistance. But when it really comes down to it, for cats,
staying clean is a matter of life and death. Cats are carnivores… ambush predators. They hide and sneak up on their unsuspecting
prey. One whiff of the wrong odor could give the
cat away. But when they pounce, it’s their bite that
finishes the job. Cats have extra-wide mouths so they can get
their teeth around their prey’s neck. It would be like having the corners of your
mouth go all the way back by your ears. But there’s a tradeoff that comes with that
big bite. Those wide mouths mean their lips can’t
come together to form a good seal. They can’t create suction to drink the way
we do. So, they flick the water with the tip of their
tongue Researchers at MIT made a model using a glass
disc, to show how cats get a drink by just barely touching the water’s surface. The water sticks to the disc and to itself. Lift the disc at the right speed and it pulls
the water up into a column. Then, the cat bites it at precisely the right
moment to get as much water as possible. And all of this happens four times per second! It’s a complicated way to take a drink,
but it’s just one of prices cats pay to be the expert predators they are… Hey guys, It’s Lauren. You know you love fuzzy critters. So check out our other episodes like this
one. See what you can learn about a squirrel's
mood just by looking at its tail. Or how the fuzziness of owl feathers makes
them such stealthy hunters. And if you like the show, share us! Thanks for watching.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, such as cargo ships and sharks, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about cats and their difficulty drinking.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on question structure and format, I would say that Question 6: **Evaluation** is the closest match. This question has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ, with a question and multiple options, but the content is still unrelated.

Therefore, I would not recommend any of the generated MCQs as a match for the ground truth MCQ. A new set of generated MCQs that are relevant to the topic of cats and their behavior would be needed to find a suitable match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say -1 or None, as there is no suitable match among the generated MCQs.

What makes something cool? Like a vintage car, or a classic product, or an iconic design? You might say, who knows. There’s just something to them. This thing is totally subjective. But all of those designs you just saw were actually from the same guy -- Raymond Loewy. And once you understand his theory of what makes things cool, you’ll see it everywhere. Raymond Loewy was an industrial engineer who did more than maybe any other person to shape the look of America in the 20th century. His designs are everywhere: logos, trains, buses, kitchens, even outer space. Loewy had a universal theory of cool: “Most Advanced Yet Acceptable”— or MAYA. People want to be trendy, but they don’t want to be weird. Loewy’s trick was this: to sell something surprising, make it familiar. To sell something familiar, make it surprising. How does this work in practice? In 1932, Raymond Loewy presented a train design to Pennsylvania Railroad. His big idea was a single, sleek shell for the train the shape of a long bullet. But his initial design was met with great skepticism, so he decided to introduce the idea in stages. His came back with a version that was only slightly more advanced than Thomas the Tank Engine. But his next design was more advanced, and then more advanced... until he finally persuaded the train executives that his original, advanced version was acceptable. This is the MAYA method. He made the surprising feel familiar. There’s scientific evidence to back up these claims. One of the sturdiest findings in psychological history is known as the “mere-exposure” effect. In the 1960s, the psychologist Robert Zajonc conducted an experiment where he showed subjects nonsense words, random shapes, and Chinese characters, and asked participants to pick their favorites. The subjects consistently chose the shapes and words that they'd seen the most. Exposure leads to familiarity and familiarity leads to subconscious preference. There’s even an explanation from evolutionary psychology: If you're a hunter/gatherer trawling a Savannah of Africa and you see a plant or an animal that you recognize, that's a good sign that it hasn't killed you … at least not yet. So we have the “acceptable” part of Raymond Loewy’s theory -- that people naturally gravitate towards familiarity. But what about the “advanced” aspect? There is another powerful idea in psychology called habituation. That means, people get tired of having to see the same thing over and over again, like a vampire movie. The power of familiarity fails when people feel like they are being forced to confront it. Like having to hear that Ed Sheeran song for the one-thousandth time. No! And for that reason, the power of familiarity seems to be strongest when a person is least expecting it. A case study is Spotify’s Discover Weekly
feature. Spotify delivers a personalized playlist of 30 new songs every Monday to its users. Initially, the feature was supposed to include entirely new music by new artists. A bug in the algorithm accidentally let through songs that users had already heard before. So, engineers fixed the bug. And to their astonishment, engagement with the feature collapsed. They realized that people trusted new songs when they recognized old ones. To enjoy the surprising music, they needed a dash of the familiar. Raymond Loewy understood combining the new and the old intuitively. One of his last assignments was to help NASA design the interior of one of it's first space stations: Sky Lab. He added creature comforts, like a shower and a dining room table. But his most ingenious idea was to add a small window. A viewing portal of planet Earth. You have surely seen this viewing portal -- it’s in almost every movie about astronauts and space. It’s the perfect manifestation of MAYA: a window to a new world can also show you home.

**Transcript**:
Most people will take a pill, receive an injection, or otherwise take some kind of medicine
during their lives, but most of us don't know anything
about how these substances actually work. How can various compounds impact the way
we physically feel, think, and even behave? For the most part, this depends on
how a drug alters the communication between cells in the brain. There are a number of different ways
that can happen. But before it gets into the brain, any drug must first reach the bloodstream on a journey that can take anywhere
from seconds to hours, depending on factors like how
it's administered. The slowest method is to take
a drug orally because it must be absorbed by
our digestive system before it takes effect. Inhaling a drug gets it into
the bloodstream faster. And injecting a drug intravenously
works quickly too because it pumps the chemicals directly
into the blood. Once there, the drug quickly reaches
the gates of its destination, the brain. The entrance to this organ is guarded
by the blood-brain barrier, which separates blood 
from the nervous system to keep potentially dangerous 
substances out. So all drugs must have a specific
chemical composition which gives them the key to unlock
this barrier and pass through. Once inside, drugs start to interfere
with the brain's normal functioning by targeting its web of neurons 
and synapses. Neurons are brain cells that have
a nucleus, dendrites, and an axon. Synapses are structures placed along
the dendrites or the axon which allow the exchange of 
electrochemical signals between neurons. Those signals take the form of chemicals
called neurotransmitters. Each neurotransmitter plays different
roles in regulating our behaviors, emotions, and cognition. But they all work in one of two ways. They can either inhibit 
the receiving neuron, limiting its activity, or excite it, creating a new electrochemical signal
that spreads throughout the network. Any leftover neurotransmitter usually
gets degraded or reabsorbed 
into the transmitting neuron. A drug's effectiveness stems 
from its ability to manipulate these synaptic transmissions
at different phases of the process. That results in an increase or a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitters
being spread. For instance, common antidepressants,
like SSRIs, stop the reabsorption of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that modulates
our moods. This effectively pushes more of it
into the neural network. Meanwhile, painkillers, like morphine, raise levels of serotonin 
and noradrenaline, which regulate energy, arousal, alertness, and pleasure. Those same neurotransmitters also
affect endorphin receptors, reducing pain perception. And tranquilizers works by increasing
the production of GABA to inhibit neural activity putting the person in a relaxed
or sedated state. What about illegal or elicit drugs? These have powerful impacts on the brain
that we're still trying to understand. Crystal meth, an amphetamine, induces a long-lasting release
of dopamine, a neurotransmitter linked with
the perception of reward and pleasure. It also activates noradrenaline receptors, which increases the heart rate, dilates pupils, and triggers the body's fight
or flight response. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine
and serotonin, pushing more into the network where they boost energy, create feelings of euphoria, and suppress appetites. And hallucinogenic drugs have some
of the most puzzling effects. Substances like LSD, mescaline, and DMT all block the release of serotonin, which regulates mood and impulsivity. They also have an impact 
on the neural circuits involved in perception, learning,
and behavioral regulation, which may explain why these drugs
have such powerful impacts. Even if some of these 
effects sound exciting, there are reasons why some of these drugs
are highly controlled and often illegal. Drugs have the power to alter 
the brain's chemistry, and repeated use can permanently
rewire the neural networks that support our ability to think, make decisions, learn, and remember things. There's a lot we still don't know 
about drugs and their effects, both the good and the bad. But those we do know about are the ones
we've studied closely, and turned into effective medicines. As our knowledge grows about drugs
and the brain, the possibilities will also increase for treating the many medical problems
that puzzle researchers today.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the history and culture of Great Zimbabwe, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the topic of how drugs work in the human body.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in terms of question structure and format, I would choose Question 3: **Application**: How did Great Zimbabwe's role in the intercontinental trade network contribute to its growth? Options: A. By controlling the sources and trade of gold, ivory, and copper, B. By building a large wall to protect the city from invaders, C. By establishing a strong military presence in the region, D. By creating a new form of currency Correct Option: A.

But again, this is a very weak match, and I would not recommend using any of the generated MCQs as a substitute for the ground truth MCQ.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

**Transcript**:
Most people will take a pill, receive an injection, or otherwise take some kind of medicine
during their lives, but most of us don't know anything
about how these substances actually work. How can various compounds impact the way
we physically feel, think, and even behave? For the most part, this depends on
how a drug alters the communication between cells in the brain. There are a number of different ways
that can happen. But before it gets into the brain, any drug must first reach the bloodstream on a journey that can take anywhere
from seconds to hours, depending on factors like how
it's administered. The slowest method is to take
a drug orally because it must be absorbed by
our digestive system before it takes effect. Inhaling a drug gets it into
the bloodstream faster. And injecting a drug intravenously
works quickly too because it pumps the chemicals directly
into the blood. Once there, the drug quickly reaches
the gates of its destination, the brain. The entrance to this organ is guarded
by the blood-brain barrier, which separates blood 
from the nervous system to keep potentially dangerous 
substances out. So all drugs must have a specific
chemical composition which gives them the key to unlock
this barrier and pass through. Once inside, drugs start to interfere
with the brain's normal functioning by targeting its web of neurons 
and synapses. Neurons are brain cells that have
a nucleus, dendrites, and an axon. Synapses are structures placed along
the dendrites or the axon which allow the exchange of 
electrochemical signals between neurons. Those signals take the form of chemicals
called neurotransmitters. Each neurotransmitter plays different
roles in regulating our behaviors, emotions, and cognition. But they all work in one of two ways. They can either inhibit 
the receiving neuron, limiting its activity, or excite it, creating a new electrochemical signal
that spreads throughout the network. Any leftover neurotransmitter usually
gets degraded or reabsorbed 
into the transmitting neuron. A drug's effectiveness stems 
from its ability to manipulate these synaptic transmissions
at different phases of the process. That results in an increase or a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitters
being spread. For instance, common antidepressants,
like SSRIs, stop the reabsorption of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that modulates
our moods. This effectively pushes more of it
into the neural network. Meanwhile, painkillers, like morphine, raise levels of serotonin 
and noradrenaline, which regulate energy, arousal, alertness, and pleasure. Those same neurotransmitters also
affect endorphin receptors, reducing pain perception. And tranquilizers works by increasing
the production of GABA to inhibit neural activity putting the person in a relaxed
or sedated state. What about illegal or elicit drugs? These have powerful impacts on the brain
that we're still trying to understand. Crystal meth, an amphetamine, induces a long-lasting release
of dopamine, a neurotransmitter linked with
the perception of reward and pleasure. It also activates noradrenaline receptors, which increases the heart rate, dilates pupils, and triggers the body's fight
or flight response. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine
and serotonin, pushing more into the network where they boost energy, create feelings of euphoria, and suppress appetites. And hallucinogenic drugs have some
of the most puzzling effects. Substances like LSD, mescaline, and DMT all block the release of serotonin, which regulates mood and impulsivity. They also have an impact 
on the neural circuits involved in perception, learning,
and behavioral regulation, which may explain why these drugs
have such powerful impacts. Even if some of these 
effects sound exciting, there are reasons why some of these drugs
are highly controlled and often illegal. Drugs have the power to alter 
the brain's chemistry, and repeated use can permanently
rewire the neural networks that support our ability to think, make decisions, learn, and remember things. There's a lot we still don't know 
about drugs and their effects, both the good and the bad. But those we do know about are the ones
we've studied closely, and turned into effective medicines. As our knowledge grows about drugs
and the brain, the possibilities will also increase for treating the many medical problems
that puzzle researchers today.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the history and culture of Great Zimbabwe, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the structure and function of synapses in the brain.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match. But please note that the content and intent of Question 2 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of the transcript, which is the structure and function of the brain, and then try to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the new generated MCQs.

In this case, I would recommend generating new MCQs that are relevant to the topic, and then trying to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the new generated MCQs. If you provide me with the new generated MCQs, I would be happy to help you identify the most similar one.

**Transcript**:
Most people will take a pill, receive an injection, or otherwise take some kind of medicine
during their lives, but most of us don't know anything
about how these substances actually work. How can various compounds impact the way
we physically feel, think, and even behave? For the most part, this depends on
how a drug alters the communication between cells in the brain. There are a number of different ways
that can happen. But before it gets into the brain, any drug must first reach the bloodstream on a journey that can take anywhere
from seconds to hours, depending on factors like how
it's administered. The slowest method is to take
a drug orally because it must be absorbed by
our digestive system before it takes effect. Inhaling a drug gets it into
the bloodstream faster. And injecting a drug intravenously
works quickly too because it pumps the chemicals directly
into the blood. Once there, the drug quickly reaches
the gates of its destination, the brain. The entrance to this organ is guarded
by the blood-brain barrier, which separates blood 
from the nervous system to keep potentially dangerous 
substances out. So all drugs must have a specific
chemical composition which gives them the key to unlock
this barrier and pass through. Once inside, drugs start to interfere
with the brain's normal functioning by targeting its web of neurons 
and synapses. Neurons are brain cells that have
a nucleus, dendrites, and an axon. Synapses are structures placed along
the dendrites or the axon which allow the exchange of 
electrochemical signals between neurons. Those signals take the form of chemicals
called neurotransmitters. Each neurotransmitter plays different
roles in regulating our behaviors, emotions, and cognition. But they all work in one of two ways. They can either inhibit 
the receiving neuron, limiting its activity, or excite it, creating a new electrochemical signal
that spreads throughout the network. Any leftover neurotransmitter usually
gets degraded or reabsorbed 
into the transmitting neuron. A drug's effectiveness stems 
from its ability to manipulate these synaptic transmissions
at different phases of the process. That results in an increase or a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitters
being spread. For instance, common antidepressants,
like SSRIs, stop the reabsorption of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that modulates
our moods. This effectively pushes more of it
into the neural network. Meanwhile, painkillers, like morphine, raise levels of serotonin 
and noradrenaline, which regulate energy, arousal, alertness, and pleasure. Those same neurotransmitters also
affect endorphin receptors, reducing pain perception. And tranquilizers works by increasing
the production of GABA to inhibit neural activity putting the person in a relaxed
or sedated state. What about illegal or elicit drugs? These have powerful impacts on the brain
that we're still trying to understand. Crystal meth, an amphetamine, induces a long-lasting release
of dopamine, a neurotransmitter linked with
the perception of reward and pleasure. It also activates noradrenaline receptors, which increases the heart rate, dilates pupils, and triggers the body's fight
or flight response. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine
and serotonin, pushing more into the network where they boost energy, create feelings of euphoria, and suppress appetites. And hallucinogenic drugs have some
of the most puzzling effects. Substances like LSD, mescaline, and DMT all block the release of serotonin, which regulates mood and impulsivity. They also have an impact 
on the neural circuits involved in perception, learning,
and behavioral regulation, which may explain why these drugs
have such powerful impacts. Even if some of these 
effects sound exciting, there are reasons why some of these drugs
are highly controlled and often illegal. Drugs have the power to alter 
the brain's chemistry, and repeated use can permanently
rewire the neural networks that support our ability to think, make decisions, learn, and remember things. There's a lot we still don't know 
about drugs and their effects, both the good and the bad. But those we do know about are the ones
we've studied closely, and turned into effective medicines. As our knowledge grows about drugs
and the brain, the possibilities will also increase for treating the many medical problems
that puzzle researchers today.

**Transcript**:
You are the cargo director on the maiden
voyage of the S.S. Buoyant, and you've agreed to transport
several tanks containing the last specimens of a critically
endangered fish species to their new aquarium. Unfortunately, as you're passing
through shark-infested waters, the boat is battered by a fierce storm,
throwing your precious cargo overboard. And to make matters worse, no one seems certain
just how many fish tanks are missing. Fortunately, you have a rescue sub
at your disposal, but only enough fuel for one trip
to the ocean floor. You need to know where the tanks are so you can gather them all
in one quick pass. Not a single fish can be lost. You decide to scan the three sectors
of the ocean floor where the cargo could have landed. Thermal imaging shows 50 organisms
in the area, and you quickly realize that that number
includes both your fish and some ravenous sharks. You flip on the sonar 
to get a better look. The image for Sector Alpha shows
four tanks and two sharks, the image for Sector Beta shows
two tanks and four sharks, and the image for Sector Gamma
is blank. Your sonar has malfunctioned, and you're going to have to go
with the info you have. You check the shipping notes, but all you learn is that each tank
had the same number of fish inside. The cargo hold had space for anywhere
from 1 to 13 total tanks. And finally, the old captain tells you
that this area has the odd property that no two sectors can have the same
number of sharks, but every sector will have at least one, and no more than seven. There's no time to waste. The tanks won't withstand the pressure
much longer. As you descend in the sub,
you review everything you know. How many fish tanks do you need
to find in Sector Gamma? Hurry, the fate of an entire species
depends on you. Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 At first, it seems like there are just
too many missing pieces of information. After all, you don't know how many fish
or how many tanks there are, let alone how many fish are in each one. But then you remember the best way to compare multiple pieces 
of partial information - a table. Since we know there are thirteen
tanks at most, and we already see six tanks
in Sectors Alpha and Beta, we know the total number of tanks
must be between 6 and 13. We also know that each sector has 
a different amount of sharks with no more than seven in each one. Since there are two in Sector Alpha
and four in Sector Beta, Sector Gamma can have 
1, 3, 5, 6, or 7 sharks. What about the number of endangered fish? Out of the 50 total organisms
in all three sectors, we know at least seven are sharks, leaving a maximum of 43 fish
inside all the tanks. And the more sharks we find in Sector 3,
the fewer fish there are to save. Now, remember that the fish are
equally distributed across all the tanks. Why is that important? Because it means that one of the possible
values for the total amount of fish must be divisible by one of the possible
values for the total amount of tanks. And looking at the table, we can see
that the only combination that works is 39 fish divided between 13 tanks
with three fish in each. With sharks swarming around, you quickly pilot the sub through
the first two sectors before retrieving the remaining
seven tanks in Sector Gamma. You've saved the species
and taken an impromptu dive. All in all, not a bad day,
unless you happen to be a hungry shark.

a different amount of sharks with no more than seven in each one. Since there are two in Sector Alpha
and four in Sector Beta, Sector Gamma can have 
1, 3, 5, 6, or 7 sharks. What about the number of endangered fish? Out of the 50 total organisms
in all three sectors, we know at least seven are sharks, leaving a maximum of 43 fish
inside all the tanks. And the more sharks we find in Sector 3,
the fewer fish there are to save. Now, remember that the fish are
equally distributed across all the tanks. Why is that important? Because it means that one of the possible
values for the total amount of fish must be divisible by one of the possible
values for the total amount of tanks. And looking at the table, we can see
that the only combination that works is 39 fish divided between 13 tanks
with three fish in each. With sharks swarming around, you quickly pilot the sub through
the first two sectors before retrieving the remaining
seven tanks in Sector Gamma. You've saved the species
and taken an impromptu dive. All in all, not a bad day,
unless you happen to be a hungry shark.

**Transcript**:
You are the cargo director on the maiden
voyage of the S.S. Buoyant, and you've agreed to transport
several tanks containing the last specimens of a critically
endangered fish species to their new aquarium. Unfortunately, as you're passing
through shark-infested waters, the boat is battered by a fierce storm,
throwing your precious cargo overboard. And to make matters worse, no one seems certain
just how many fish tanks are missing. Fortunately, you have a rescue sub
at your disposal, but only enough fuel for one trip
to the ocean floor. You need to know where the tanks are so you can gather them all
in one quick pass. Not a single fish can be lost. You decide to scan the three sectors
of the ocean floor where the cargo could have landed. Thermal imaging shows 50 organisms
in the area, and you quickly realize that that number
includes both your fish and some ravenous sharks. You flip on the sonar 
to get a better look. The image for Sector Alpha shows
four tanks and two sharks, the image for Sector Beta shows
two tanks and four sharks, and the image for Sector Gamma
is blank. Your sonar has malfunctioned, and you're going to have to go
with the info you have. You check the shipping notes, but all you learn is that each tank
had the same number of fish inside. The cargo hold had space for anywhere
from 1 to 13 total tanks. And finally, the old captain tells you
that this area has the odd property that no two sectors can have the same
number of sharks, but every sector will have at least one, and no more than seven. There's no time to waste. The tanks won't withstand the pressure
much longer. As you descend in the sub,
you review everything you know. How many fish tanks do you need
to find in Sector Gamma? Hurry, the fate of an entire species
depends on you. Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 At first, it seems like there are just
too many missing pieces of information. After all, you don't know how many fish
or how many tanks there are, let alone how many fish are in each one. But then you remember the best way to compare multiple pieces 
of partial information - a table. Since we know there are thirteen
tanks at most, and we already see six tanks

**Transcript**:
Lead is a sneaky little element. It’s malleable and durable, so it’s no
wonder that for years we used it in piping and added it to paint. But it’s also extremely poisonous. It can create problems all over the body—from
rashes, to abdominal pain, to anemia. But the most serious effects occur in the
brain—and especially in the brains of children. It can cause headaches, memory loss, learning
disabilities, behavioral issues, and seizures. And kids don’t even have to be exposed directly. Women who wind up ingesting lead can store
it in their bones. And if they get pregnant, that lead can be
passed on and damage the brains of their children. Lead poisoning is still a big problem in the
US today—and not just in communities you may have heard of, like Flint, Michigan. So, what’s actually happening to the brain
when you have lead poisoning? And is there anything we can do to stop it? I’m Anna and this is Gross Science. Lead messes with our brains in a few different
ways. But to understand what they are, let’s look
really quickly at how brain cells—or neurons—communicate: and I promise, this will be short, sweet,
and hopefully deeply enlightening. Ok, so neurons have a long tail called an
“axon” at one end, and branch-like structures called “dendrites” at the other. They talk to one another when the axon from
one cell sends chemical signals to another cell’s dendrites. The receiving cell can then pass the message
on to yet another neuron. And all that communicating happens in this
tiny gap between the cells called the “synapse.” One thing lead can do is block those chemical
signals from being sent, which sounds bad enough. But, lead does another thing that can have
even more long-term effects. It can make the synapse—that connection
between your neurons—become weaker over time. You see, in order for neurons to maintain
a strong connection, the axon needs to know that the dendrite is receiving its messages. So the dendrite produces a molecule that lets
the axon know it’s being heard loud and clear. That molecule is called BDNF, and you can
kind of think of it like the best-friends molecule. It makes the axon and dendrite’s relationship
even stronger. But, in order for the cell to produce BDNF,
it needs calcium. Calcium usually enters the dendrite through
channels, which act like a door that opens for a little while when a signal is received. When the door’s unlocked by the right set
of molecules, calcium flows through freely. But when lead’s present, it jams the door,
preventing calcium from entering and keeping BDNF from being made. That means that the connections between brain
cells start to wither. In adults, having poor connections between
your neurons is harmful enough. But in children, with their fast growing brains,
it’s especially dangerous—not to mention that the amount of lead needed to cause brain
damage in kids is much smaller, in part because their brains are making (and removing) new
connections at much faster rates. Sadly, in the past there haven’t been great
treatments for lead poisoning—and especially not for its effects on the brain. But recently, scientists have shown that simply
by adding a BDNF substitute, neurons may be able to bounce back. Here’s a video showing this process in action. On the left are normal cells, in the middle
are cells exposed to lead, and on the right are cells exposed to lead that have been given
BDNF. When the green dye disappears, it means that
the neurons are able to send their chemical signals—so when the video turns black you
know everything’s working properly. You can see that the green starts to disappear
in the cells with additional BDNF, even though they’ve been exposed to lead. Now, we’re still far from using BDNF as
a cure for lead poisoning—this isn’t even being tested on humans yet. Certainly, preventing the exposure to lead
in the first place should be the primary goal. But this research offers hope that one day,
lead poisoning may be much more treatable. And that’s a great thing, since today, at
least 4 million American households with kids are exposed to high levels of lead. And that’s gross. Ew.

treatments for lead poisoning—and especially not for its effects on the brain. But recently, scientists have shown that simply
by adding a BDNF substitute, neurons may be able to bounce back. Here’s a video showing this process in action. On the left are normal cells, in the middle
are cells exposed to lead, and on the right are cells exposed to lead that have been given
BDNF. When the green dye disappears, it means that
the neurons are able to send their chemical signals—so when the video turns black you
know everything’s working properly. You can see that the green starts to disappear
in the cells with additional BDNF, even though they’ve been exposed to lead. Now, we’re still far from using BDNF as
a cure for lead poisoning—this isn’t even being tested on humans yet. Certainly, preventing the exposure to lead
in the first place should be the primary goal. But this research offers hope that one day,
lead poisoning may be much more treatable. And that’s a great thing, since today, at
least 4 million American households with kids are exposed to high levels of lead. And that’s gross. Ew.

**Transcript**:
Stretched across a tree-peppered expanse
in southern Africa lies the magnificent ruins
of Great Zimbabwe, a medieval stone city of astounding
wealth and prestige. Located in the present-day country
of Zimbabwe, it's the sight of the largest known
settlement ruins in Sub-Saharan Africa, second on the continent only
to the pyramids of Egypt. But the history of this city
is shrouded in controversy, defined by decades of dispute
about who built it and why. Its name comes from the Shona word
madzimbabwe, meaning big house of stone for its unscalable stone walls
that reach heights of nearly ten meters and run for a length of about 250 meters. For its grandeur 
and historical significance, it was named a UNESCO 
World Heritage site in 1986. Back in the 14th and 15th centuries,
it was a thriving city. Spread across nearly eight 
square-kilometers, Great Zimbabwe was defined by
three main areas: the Hill Complex, where the king lived; the Great Enclosure, reserved for
members of the royal family; and the Valley Complex, 
where regular citizens lived. Rulers were both powerful economic
and religious leaders for the region. At its highest point, the city had a bustling urban population 
of 18,000 people and was one of the major African 
trade centers at the time. What enabled this growth 
was Great Zimbabwe's influential role in an intercontinental trade network. Connected to several key city-states
along the East African Swahili Coast, it was part of the larger Indian Ocean
trade routes. The city generated its riches 
by controlling the sources and trade of the most prized items: gold, ivory, and copper. With this mercantile power, it was able
to extend its sphere of influence across continents, fostering a strong Arab and Indian
trader presence throughout its zenith. Archaeologists have since pieced together
the details of this history through artifacts discovered on site. There were pottery shards
and glassworks from Asia, as well as coins minted in the coastal
trading city of Kilwa Kisiwani over 1,500 miles away. They also found soapstone bird figures, which are thought to represent
each of the city's rulers, and young calf bones,
only unearthed near the royal residence, show how the diet of the elite
differed from the general population. These clues have also led to theories
about the city's decline. By the mid-15th century, the buildings at Great Zimbabwe
were almost all that remained. Archaeological evidence points
to overcrowding and sanitation issues as the cause, compounded by soil depletion
triggered by overuse. Eventually, as crops withered
and conditions in the city worsened, the population of Great Zimbabwe
is thought to have dispersed and formed the nearby Mutapa
and Torwa states. Centuries later, a new phase
of Great Zimbabwe's influence began to play out in the political realm as people debated who had built
the famous city of stone. During the European 
colonization of Africa, racist colonial officials claimed 
the ruins couldn't be of African origin. So, without a detailed written 
record on hand, they instead relied on myths to explain
the magnificence of Great Zimbabwe. Some claimed it proved the Bible
story of the Queen of Sheba who lived in a city of riches. Others argued it was built by
the Ancient Greeks. Then, in the early 20th century
after extensive excavation at the site, the archaeologist David Randall-MacIver presented clear evidence 
that Great Zimbabwe was built by indigenous peoples. Yet, at the time, the country's white 
minority colonial government sought to discredit this theory because it
challenged the legitimacy of their rule. In fact, the government actively
encouraged historians to produce accounts that disputed
the city's African origins. Over time, however, an overwhelming
body of evidence mounted, identifying Great Zimbabwe as an African
city built by Africans. During the 1960s and 70s, Great Zimbabwe became an important symbol 
for the African Nationalist movement that was spreading across the continent. Today, the ruins at Great Zimbabwe, alluded to on the Zimbabwean flag
by a soapstone bird, still stand as a source of national pride
and cultural value.

**Transcript**:
Stretched across a tree-peppered expanse
in southern Africa lies the magnificent ruins
of Great Zimbabwe, a medieval stone city of astounding
wealth and prestige. Located in the present-day country
of Zimbabwe, it's the sight of the largest known
settlement ruins in Sub-Saharan Africa, second on the continent only
to the pyramids of Egypt. But the history of this city
is shrouded in controversy, defined by decades of dispute
about who built it and why. Its name comes from the Shona word
madzimbabwe, meaning big house of stone for its unscalable stone walls
that reach heights of nearly ten meters and run for a length of about 250 meters. For its grandeur 
and historical significance, it was named a UNESCO 
World Heritage site in 1986. Back in the 14th and 15th centuries,
it was a thriving city. Spread across nearly eight 
square-kilometers, Great Zimbabwe was defined by
three main areas: the Hill Complex, where the king lived; the Great Enclosure, reserved for
members of the royal family; and the Valley Complex, 
where regular citizens lived. Rulers were both powerful economic
and religious leaders for the region. At its highest point, the city had a bustling urban population 
of 18,000 people and was one of the major African 
trade centers at the time. What enabled this growth 
was Great Zimbabwe's influential role in an intercontinental trade network. Connected to several key city-states
along the East African Swahili Coast, it was part of the larger Indian Ocean
trade routes. The city generated its riches 
by controlling the sources and trade of the most prized items: gold, ivory, and copper. With this mercantile power, it was able
to extend its sphere of influence across continents, fostering a strong Arab and Indian
trader presence throughout its zenith. Archaeologists have since pieced together
the details of this history through artifacts discovered on site. There were pottery shards
and glassworks from Asia, as well as coins minted in the coastal
trading city of Kilwa Kisiwani over 1,500 miles away. They also found soapstone bird figures, which are thought to represent
each of the city's rulers, and young calf bones,
only unearthed near the royal residence, show how the diet of the elite
differed from the general population. These clues have also led to theories
about the city's decline. By the mid-15th century, the buildings at Great Zimbabwe
were almost all that remained. Archaeological evidence points
to overcrowding and sanitation issues as the cause, compounded by soil depletion
triggered by overuse. Eventually, as crops withered
and conditions in the city worsened, the population of Great Zimbabwe
is thought to have dispersed and formed the nearby Mutapa
and Torwa states. Centuries later, a new phase
of Great Zimbabwe's influence began to play out in the political realm as people debated who had built
the famous city of stone. During the European 
colonization of Africa, racist colonial officials claimed 
the ruins couldn't be of African origin. So, without a detailed written 
record on hand, they instead relied on myths to explain
the magnificence of Great Zimbabwe. Some claimed it proved the Bible
story of the Queen of Sheba who lived in a city of riches. Others argued it was built by
the Ancient Greeks. Then, in the early 20th century
after extensive excavation at the site, the archaeologist David Randall-MacIver presented clear evidence 
that Great Zimbabwe was built by indigenous peoples. Yet, at the time, the country's white 
minority colonial government sought to discredit this theory because it
challenged the legitimacy of their rule. In fact, the government actively
encouraged historians to produce accounts that disputed
the city's African origins. Over time, however, an overwhelming
body of evidence mounted, identifying Great Zimbabwe as an African
city built by Africans. During the 1960s and 70s, Great Zimbabwe became an important symbol 
for the African Nationalist movement that was spreading across the continent. Today, the ruins at Great Zimbabwe, alluded to on the Zimbabwean flag
by a soapstone bird, still stand as a source of national pride
and cultural value.

You've been stranded thousands
of miles from home with no money or possessions. Such a predicament would make many
people despair and curse their awful fate. But for Zeno of Cyprus, it became the
foundation of his life's work and legacy. The once wealthy merchant lost everything
when he was shipwrecked in Athens around 300 BCE. With not much else to do,
he wandered into a book shop, became intrigued by reading about Socrates, and proceeded to seek out and study
with the city's noted philosophers. As Zeno began educating his own students, he originated the philosophy
known as Stoicism, whose teachings of virtue, tolerance,
and self-control have inspired generations of thinkers
and leaders. The name Stoicism comes 
from the Stoa Poikile, the decorated public colonnade where Zeno and his disciples gathered
for discussion. Today, we colloquially 
use the word stoic to mean someone who 
remains calm under pressure and avoids emotional extremes. But while this captures important
aspects of Stoicism, the original philosophy was more
than just an attitude. The Stoics believed that 
everything around us operates according 
to a web of cause and effect, resulting in a rational structure
of the universe, which they called logos. And while we may not always
have control over the events affecting us, we can have control over 
how we approach things. Rather than imagining an ideal society, the Stoic tries to deal 
with the world as it is while pursuing self-improvement
through four cardinal virtues: practical wisdom, the ability to navigate complex situations
in a logical, informed, and calm manner; temperance, the exercise of self-restraint 
and moderation in all aspects of life; justice, treating others with fairness even
when they have done wrong; and courage, not just in extraordinary circumstances, but facing daily challenges
with clarity and integrity. As Seneca, one of the most famous
Roman Stoics wrote, "Sometimes, even to live 
is an act of courage." But while Stoicism focuses on 
personal improvement, it's not a self-centered philosophy. At a time when Roman laws considered
slaves as property, Seneca called for their humane treatment and stressed that we all share
the same fundamental humanity. Nor does Stoicism encourage passivity. The idea is that only people 
who have cultivated virtue and self-control in themselves
can bring positive change in others. One of the most famous Stoic writers
was also one of Rome's greatest emperors. Over the course of his 19-year reign, Stoicism gave Marcus Aurelius the resolve
to lead the Empire through two major wars, while dealing with the loss of many
of his children. Centuries later, Marcus's journals would
guide and comfort Nelson Mandela through his 27-year imprisonment during his struggle 
for racial equality in South Africa. After his release and eventual victory,
Mandela stressed peace and reconciliation, believing that while the injustices
of the past couldn't be changed, his people could confront them
in the present and seek to build a better,
more just future. Stoicism was an active school 
of philosophy for several centuries in Greece and Rome. As a formal institution, it faded away, but its influence has continued
to this day. Christian theologians, 
such as Thomas Aquinas, have admired and adopted its focus
on the virtues, and there are parallels between
Stoic Ataraxia, or tranquility of mind, and the Buddhist concept of Nirvana. One particularly influential Stoic
was the philosopher Epictetus who wrote that suffering stems not from the events in our lives,
but from our judgements about them. This has resonated strongly
with modern psychology and the self-help movement. For example, rational emotive
behavioral therapy focuses on changing 
the self-defeating attitudes people form about 
their life circumstances. There's also Viktor Frankl's logotherapy. Informed by Frankl's own time
as a concentration camp prisoner, logotherapy is based on 
the Stoic principle that we can harness our will power
to fill our lives with meaning, even in the bleakest situations.

to lead the Empire through two major wars, while dealing with the loss of many
of his children. Centuries later, Marcus's journals would
guide and comfort Nelson Mandela through his 27-year imprisonment during his struggle 
for racial equality in South Africa. After his release and eventual victory,
Mandela stressed peace and reconciliation, believing that while the injustices
of the past couldn't be changed, his people could confront them
in the present and seek to build a better,
more just future. Stoicism was an active school 
of philosophy for several centuries in Greece and Rome. As a formal institution, it faded away, but its influence has continued
to this day. Christian theologians, 
such as Thomas Aquinas, have admired and adopted its focus
on the virtues, and there are parallels between
Stoic Ataraxia, or tranquility of mind, and the Buddhist concept of Nirvana. One particularly influential Stoic
was the philosopher Epictetus who wrote that suffering stems not from the events in our lives,
but from our judgements about them. This has resonated strongly
with modern psychology and the self-help movement. For example, rational emotive
behavioral therapy focuses on changing 
the self-defeating attitudes people form about 
their life circumstances. There's also Viktor Frankl's logotherapy. Informed by Frankl's own time
as a concentration camp prisoner, logotherapy is based on 
the Stoic principle that we can harness our will power
to fill our lives with meaning, even in the bleakest situations.

**Transcript**:
You've been stranded thousands
of miles from home with no money or possessions. Such a predicament would make many
people despair and curse their awful fate. But for Zeno of Cyprus, it became the
foundation of his life's work and legacy. The once wealthy merchant lost everything
when he was shipwrecked in Athens around 300 BCE. With not much else to do,
he wandered into a book shop, became intrigued by reading about Socrates, and proceeded to seek out and study
with the city's noted philosophers. As Zeno began educating his own students, he originated the philosophy
known as Stoicism, whose teachings of virtue, tolerance,
and self-control have inspired generations of thinkers
and leaders. The name Stoicism comes 
from the Stoa Poikile, the decorated public colonnade where Zeno and his disciples gathered
for discussion. Today, we colloquially 
use the word stoic to mean someone who 
remains calm under pressure and avoids emotional extremes. But while this captures important
aspects of Stoicism, the original philosophy was more
than just an attitude. The Stoics believed that 
everything around us operates according 
to a web of cause and effect, resulting in a rational structure
of the universe, which they called logos. And while we may not always
have control over the events affecting us, we can have control over 
how we approach things. Rather than imagining an ideal society, the Stoic tries to deal 
with the world as it is while pursuing self-improvement
through four cardinal virtues: practical wisdom, the ability to navigate complex situations
in a logical, informed, and calm manner; temperance, the exercise of self-restraint 
and moderation in all aspects of life; justice, treating others with fairness even
when they have done wrong; and courage, not just in extraordinary circumstances, but facing daily challenges
with clarity and integrity. As Seneca, one of the most famous
Roman Stoics wrote, "Sometimes, even to live 
is an act of courage." But while Stoicism focuses on 
personal improvement, it's not a self-centered philosophy. At a time when Roman laws considered
slaves as property, Seneca called for their humane treatment and stressed that we all share
the same fundamental humanity. Nor does Stoicism encourage passivity. The idea is that only people 
who have cultivated virtue and self-control in themselves
can bring positive change in others. One of the most famous Stoic writers
was also one of Rome's greatest emperors. Over the course of his 19-year reign, Stoicism gave Marcus Aurelius the resolve
to lead the Empire through two major wars, while dealing with the loss of many
of his children. Centuries later, Marcus's journals would
guide and comfort Nelson Mandela through his 27-year imprisonment during his struggle 
for racial equality in South Africa. After his release and eventual victory,
Mandela stressed peace and reconciliation, believing that while the injustices
of the past couldn't be changed, his people could confront them
in the present and seek to build a better,
more just future. Stoicism was an active school 
of philosophy for several centuries in Greece and Rome. As a formal institution, it faded away, but its influence has continued
to this day. Christian theologians, 
such as Thomas Aquinas, have admired and adopted its focus
on the virtues, and there are parallels between
Stoic Ataraxia, or tranquility of mind, and the Buddhist concept of Nirvana. One particularly influential Stoic

their life circumstances. There's also Viktor Frankl's logotherapy. Informed by Frankl's own time

Between 2008 and 2012, archeologists excavated the rubble
of an ancient hospital in England. In the process, they uncovered
a number of skeletons. One in particular belonged 
to a wealthy male who lived in the 11th or 12th century and died of leprosy between 
the ages of 18 and 25. How do we know all this? Simply by examining some old,
soil-caked bones? Even centuries after death, skeletons carry unique features
that tell us about their identities. And using modern tools and techniques,
we can read those features as clues. This is a branch of science known as
biological anthropology. It allows researchers to piece together 
details about ancient individuals and identify historical events
that affected whole populations. When researchers uncover a skeleton, some of the first clues they gather,
like age and gender, lie in its morphology, which is the structure, appearance,
and size of a skeleton. Bones, like the clavicle, 
stop growing at age 25, so a skeleton with a clavicle
that hasn't fully formed must be younger than that. Similarly, the plates in the cranium
can continue fusing up to age 40, and sometimes beyond. By combining these with some 
microscopic skeletal clues, physical anthropologists can estimate
an approximate age of death. Meanwhile, pelvic bones reveal gender. Biologically, female pelvises are wider,
allowing women to give birth, where as males are narrower. Bones also betray the signs 
of ancient disease. Disorders like anemia leave their traces
on the bones. And the condition of teeth 
can reveal clues to factors like diet and malnutrition, which sometimes correlate with wealth
or poverty. A protein called collagen can give us
even more profound details. The air we breathe, water we drink, and food we eat leaves permanent traces 
in our bones and teeth in the form of chemical compounds. These compounds contain measurable
quantities called isotopes. Stable isotopes in bone collagen
and tooth enamel varies among mammals dependent on where they lived
and what they ate. So by analyzing these isotopes, we can draw direct inferences regarding 
the diet and location of historic people. Not only that, but during life, bones undergo a constant cycle
of remodeling. So if someone moves from one place
to another, bones synthesized after that move will also reflect the new isotopic 
signatures of the surrounding environment. That means that skeletons can be used
like migratory maps. For instance, between 1-650 AD, the great city of Teotihuacan in Mexico
bustled with thousands of people. Researchers examined the isotope ratios
in skeletons' tooth enamel, which held details of their diets
when they were young. They found evidence for significant
migration into the city. A majority of the individuals
were born elsewhere. With further geological 
and skeletal analysis, they may be able to map where
those people came from. That work in Teotihuacan is also
an example of how bio-anthropologists study skeletons in cemeteries 
and mass graves, then analyze their similarities 
and differences. From that information, they can learn
about cultural beliefs, social norms, wars, and what caused their deaths. Today, we use these tools to answer
big questions about how forces, like migration and disease, shape the modern world. DNA analysis is even possible in some
relatively well-preserved ancient remains. That's helping us understand how diseases
like tuberculosis have evolved over the centuries so we can build better treatments
for people today. Ancient skeletons can tell us a
surprisingly great deal about the past. So if your remains are someday 
buried intact, what might archeologists 
of the distant future learn from them?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not match the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about interpreting skeletal features of ancient individuals to help identify past historical events, which is related to biological anthropology. The generated MCQs, on the other hand, are about art, history, and philosophy, specifically the depiction of babies in medieval and Renaissance art.

Since there is no matching generated MCQ, I will not provide an index. However, I can suggest that a new set of generated MCQs that are relevant to the topic of biological anthropology and skeletal analysis would be needed to find a match.

**Transcript**:
Between 2008 and 2012, archeologists excavated the rubble
of an ancient hospital in England. In the process, they uncovered
a number of skeletons. One in particular belonged 
to a wealthy male who lived in the 11th or 12th century and died of leprosy between 
the ages of 18 and 25. How do we know all this? Simply by examining some old,
soil-caked bones? Even centuries after death, skeletons carry unique features
that tell us about their identities. And using modern tools and techniques,
we can read those features as clues. This is a branch of science known as
biological anthropology. It allows researchers to piece together 
details about ancient individuals and identify historical events
that affected whole populations. When researchers uncover a skeleton, some of the first clues they gather,
like age and gender, lie in its morphology, which is the structure, appearance,
and size of a skeleton. Bones, like the clavicle, 
stop growing at age 25, so a skeleton with a clavicle
that hasn't fully formed must be younger than that. Similarly, the plates in the cranium
can continue fusing up to age 40, and sometimes beyond. By combining these with some 
microscopic skeletal clues, physical anthropologists can estimate
an approximate age of death. Meanwhile, pelvic bones reveal gender. Biologically, female pelvises are wider,
allowing women to give birth, where as males are narrower. Bones also betray the signs 
of ancient disease. Disorders like anemia leave their traces
on the bones. And the condition of teeth 
can reveal clues to factors like diet and malnutrition, which sometimes correlate with wealth
or poverty. A protein called collagen can give us
even more profound details. The air we breathe, water we drink, and food we eat leaves permanent traces 
in our bones and teeth in the form of chemical compounds. These compounds contain measurable
quantities called isotopes. Stable isotopes in bone collagen
and tooth enamel varies among mammals dependent on where they lived
and what they ate. So by analyzing these isotopes, we can draw direct inferences regarding 
the diet and location of historic people. Not only that, but during life, bones undergo a constant cycle
of remodeling. So if someone moves from one place
to another, bones synthesized after that move will also reflect the new isotopic 
signatures of the surrounding environment. That means that skeletons can be used
like migratory maps. For instance, between 1-650 AD, the great city of Teotihuacan in Mexico
bustled with thousands of people. Researchers examined the isotope ratios
in skeletons' tooth enamel, which held details of their diets
when they were young. They found evidence for significant
migration into the city. A majority of the individuals
were born elsewhere. With further geological 
and skeletal analysis, they may be able to map where
those people came from. That work in Teotihuacan is also
an example of how bio-anthropologists study skeletons in cemeteries 
and mass graves, then analyze their similarities 
and differences. From that information, they can learn
about cultural beliefs, social norms, wars, and what caused their deaths. Today, we use these tools to answer
big questions about how forces, like migration and disease, shape the modern world. DNA analysis is even possible in some
relatively well-preserved ancient remains. That's helping us understand how diseases
like tuberculosis have evolved over the centuries so we can build better treatments
for people today. Ancient skeletons can tell us a
surprisingly great deal about the past. So if your remains are someday 
buried intact, what might archeologists 
of the distant future learn from them?

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the isotopic composition of a human body reflecting locality, nutrition, migration, or all of the above. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 5: "What is the term for the idealized forms of beauty that were influenced by Greek and Roman art?" is not related, but Question 8 does talk about a philosophical idea, and some of the other questions discuss the influence of location on art (e.g. Question 4), but these questions do not match the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

Since there isn't a generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index.

**Transcript**:
Between 2008 and 2012, archeologists excavated the rubble
of an ancient hospital in England. In the process, they uncovered
a number of skeletons. One in particular belonged 
to a wealthy male who lived in the 11th or 12th century and died of leprosy between 
the ages of 18 and 25. How do we know all this? Simply by examining some old,
soil-caked bones? Even centuries after death, skeletons carry unique features
that tell us about their identities. And using modern tools and techniques,
we can read those features as clues. This is a branch of science known as
biological anthropology. It allows researchers to piece together 
details about ancient individuals and identify historical events
that affected whole populations. When researchers uncover a skeleton, some of the first clues they gather,
like age and gender, lie in its morphology, which is the structure, appearance,
and size of a skeleton. Bones, like the clavicle, 
stop growing at age 25, so a skeleton with a clavicle
that hasn't fully formed must be younger than that. Similarly, the plates in the cranium
can continue fusing up to age 40, and sometimes beyond. By combining these with some 
microscopic skeletal clues, physical anthropologists can estimate
an approximate age of death. Meanwhile, pelvic bones reveal gender. Biologically, female pelvises are wider,
allowing women to give birth, where as males are narrower. Bones also betray the signs 
of ancient disease. Disorders like anemia leave their traces
on the bones. And the condition of teeth 
can reveal clues to factors like diet and malnutrition, which sometimes correlate with wealth
or poverty. A protein called collagen can give us
even more profound details. The air we breathe, water we drink, and food we eat leaves permanent traces 
in our bones and teeth in the form of chemical compounds. These compounds contain measurable
quantities called isotopes. Stable isotopes in bone collagen
and tooth enamel varies among mammals dependent on where they lived
and what they ate. So by analyzing these isotopes, we can draw direct inferences regarding 
the diet and location of historic people. Not only that, but during life, bones undergo a constant cycle
of remodeling. So if someone moves from one place
to another, bones synthesized after that move will also reflect the new isotopic 
signatures of the surrounding environment. That means that skeletons can be used
like migratory maps. For instance, between 1-650 AD, the great city of Teotihuacan in Mexico
bustled with thousands of people. Researchers examined the isotope ratios
in skeletons' tooth enamel, which held details of their diets
when they were young. They found evidence for significant
migration into the city. A majority of the individuals
were born elsewhere. With further geological 
and skeletal analysis, they may be able to map where
those people came from. That work in Teotihuacan is also
an example of how bio-anthropologists study skeletons in cemeteries 
and mass graves, then analyze their similarities 
and differences. From that information, they can learn
about cultural beliefs, social norms, wars, and what caused their deaths. Today, we use these tools to answer
big questions about how forces, like migration and disease, shape the modern world. DNA analysis is even possible in some
relatively well-preserved ancient remains. That's helping us understand how diseases
like tuberculosis have evolved over the centuries so we can build better treatments
for people today. Ancient skeletons can tell us a
surprisingly great deal about the past. So if your remains are someday 
buried intact, what might archeologists 
of the distant future learn from them?

**Transcript**:
When Reverend Jim Jones founded
the Peoples Temple in 1955, few could have imagined 
its horrifying end. This progressive religious movement
rose in popularity and gained support from some of San Francisco's 
most prominent politicians. But in 1977, amidst revelations
of brainwashing and abuse, Jones moved with several hundred followers to establish the commune of Jonestown 
in Guyana. Billed as a utopian paradise,
the colony was more like a prison camp, and when a congressional delegation
arrived to investigate its conditions, Jones executed his final plan. On November 18, 1978, 909 men,
women, and children died after being forced to drink 
poisoned Flavor Aid. That grizzly image has since been
immortalized as shorthand slang for single-minded cult-like thinking, "They drank the Kool-aid." Today, there are thousands of cults
around the world. It's important to note two things
about them. First, not all cults are religious. Some are political, therapy-based, focused on self-improvement, or otherwise. And on the flip side, not all new religions are what 
we're referring to as cults. So what exactly defines our modern
understanding of cults, and why do people join them? Broadly speaking, a cult is a group
or movement with a shared commitment to a usually
extreme ideology that's typically embodied
in a charismatic leader. And while few turn out as deadly
as Jonestown or Heaven's Gate, which ended in a mass suicide 
of 39 people in 1997, most cults share some 
basic characteristics. A typical cult requires a high level
of commitment from its members and maintains a strict hierarchy, separating unsuspecting supporters
and recruits from the inner workings. It claims to provide answers
to life's biggest questions through its doctrine, along with the required recipe
for change that shapes a new member
into a true believer. And most importantly, it uses both
formal and informal systems of influence and control
to keep members obedient, with little tolerance for internal 
disagreement or external scrutiny. You might wonder whether 
some of these descriptions might also apply to established religions. In fact, the world "cultus" 
originally described people who cultivated
the worship of certain gods by performing rituals 
and maintaining temples. But in time, it came to mean 
excessive devotion. Many religions began as cults, but integrated into the fabric
of the larger society as they grew. A modern cult, by contrast, separates
its members from others. Rather than providing guidelines
for members to live better lives, a cult seeks to directly control them, from personal and family relationships, to financial assets 
and living arrangements. Cults also demand obedience 
to human leaders who tend to be highly persuasive people with authoritarian 
and narcissistic streaks motivated by money, sex, power,
or all three. While a cult leader uses personal charisma
to attract initial followers, further expansion works 
like a pyramid scheme, with early members recruiting new ones. Cults are skilled at knowing 
whom to target, often focusing on those new to an area, or who have recently undergone some
personal or professional loss. Loneliness and a desire for meaning make one susceptible to friendly people
offering community. The recruitment process can be subtle, sometimes taking months
to establish a relationship. In fact, more than two-thirds
of cult members are recruited by a friend, family member, or co-worker whose invitations are harder to refuse. Once in the cult, members are subjected
to multiple forms of indoctrination. Some play on our natural inclination to
mimic social behaviors or follow orders. Other methods may be more intense using techniques of coercive persuasion
involving guilt, shame, and fear. And in many cases, members may
willingly submit out of desire to belong and to attain the promised rewards. The cult environment discourages
critical thinking, making it hard to voice doubts when everyone around you is modeling
absolute faith. The resulting internal conflict,
known as cognitive dissonance, keeps you trapped, as each compromise makes it more 
painful to admit you've been deceived. And though most cults don't
lead members to their death, they can still be harmful. By denying basic freedoms of thought,
speech, and association, cults stunt their members'
psychological and emotional growth, a particular problem for children, who are deprived of normal
developmental activities and milestones. Nevertheless, many cult members
eventually find a way out, whether through their own realizations, the help of family and friends, or when the cult falls apart
due to external pressure or scandals. Many cults may be hard to identify, and for some, their beliefs,
no matter how strange, are protected under religious freedom. But when their practices 
involve harassment, threats, illegal activities, or abuse, the law can intervene. Believing in something should not come
at the cost of your family and friends, and if someone tells you to sacrifice
your relationships or morality for the greater good, they're most likely exploiting you
for their own.

mimic social behaviors or follow orders. Other methods may be more intense using techniques of coercive persuasion
involving guilt, shame, and fear. And in many cases, members may
willingly submit out of desire to belong and to attain the promised rewards. The cult environment discourages
critical thinking, making it hard to voice doubts when everyone around you is modeling
absolute faith. The resulting internal conflict,
known as cognitive dissonance, keeps you trapped, as each compromise makes it more 
painful to admit you've been deceived. And though most cults don't
lead members to their death, they can still be harmful. By denying basic freedoms of thought,
speech, and association, cults stunt their members'
psychological and emotional growth, a particular problem for children, who are deprived of normal
developmental activities and milestones. Nevertheless, many cult members
eventually find a way out, whether through their own realizations, the help of family and friends, or when the cult falls apart
due to external pressure or scandals. Many cults may be hard to identify, and for some, their beliefs,
no matter how strange, are protected under religious freedom. But when their practices 
involve harassment, threats, illegal activities, or abuse, the law can intervene. Believing in something should not come
at the cost of your family and friends, and if someone tells you to sacrifice
your relationships or morality for the greater good, they're most likely exploiting you
for their own.

**Transcript**:
When Reverend Jim Jones founded
the Peoples Temple in 1955, few could have imagined 
its horrifying end. This progressive religious movement
rose in popularity and gained support from some of San Francisco's 
most prominent politicians. But in 1977, amidst revelations
of brainwashing and abuse, Jones moved with several hundred followers to establish the commune of Jonestown 
in Guyana. Billed as a utopian paradise,
the colony was more like a prison camp, and when a congressional delegation
arrived to investigate its conditions, Jones executed his final plan. On November 18, 1978, 909 men,
women, and children died after being forced to drink 
poisoned Flavor Aid. That grizzly image has since been
immortalized as shorthand slang for single-minded cult-like thinking, "They drank the Kool-aid." Today, there are thousands of cults
around the world. It's important to note two things
about them. First, not all cults are religious. Some are political, therapy-based, focused on self-improvement, or otherwise. And on the flip side, not all new religions are what 
we're referring to as cults. So what exactly defines our modern
understanding of cults, and why do people join them? Broadly speaking, a cult is a group
or movement with a shared commitment to a usually
extreme ideology that's typically embodied
in a charismatic leader. And while few turn out as deadly
as Jonestown or Heaven's Gate, which ended in a mass suicide 
of 39 people in 1997, most cults share some 
basic characteristics. A typical cult requires a high level
of commitment from its members and maintains a strict hierarchy, separating unsuspecting supporters
and recruits from the inner workings. It claims to provide answers
to life's biggest questions through its doctrine, along with the required recipe
for change that shapes a new member
into a true believer. And most importantly, it uses both
formal and informal systems of influence and control
to keep members obedient, with little tolerance for internal 
disagreement or external scrutiny. You might wonder whether 
some of these descriptions might also apply to established religions. In fact, the world "cultus" 
originally described people who cultivated
the worship of certain gods by performing rituals 
and maintaining temples. But in time, it came to mean 
excessive devotion. Many religions began as cults, but integrated into the fabric
of the larger society as they grew. A modern cult, by contrast, separates
its members from others. Rather than providing guidelines
for members to live better lives, a cult seeks to directly control them, from personal and family relationships, to financial assets 
and living arrangements. Cults also demand obedience 
to human leaders who tend to be highly persuasive people with authoritarian 
and narcissistic streaks motivated by money, sex, power,
or all three. While a cult leader uses personal charisma
to attract initial followers, further expansion works 
like a pyramid scheme, with early members recruiting new ones. Cults are skilled at knowing 
whom to target, often focusing on those new to an area, or who have recently undergone some
personal or professional loss. Loneliness and a desire for meaning make one susceptible to friendly people
offering community. The recruitment process can be subtle, sometimes taking months
to establish a relationship. In fact, more than two-thirds
of cult members are recruited by a friend, family member, or co-worker whose invitations are harder to refuse. Once in the cult, members are subjected
to multiple forms of indoctrination. Some play on our natural inclination to
mimic social behaviors or follow orders. Other methods may be more intense using techniques of coercive persuasion

**Transcript**:
There are few places on Earth 
less hospitable to life than the bone-dry Sahara Desert. Yet it wasn't always this way. 100 million years ago, during a period
known as the Mid-Cretaceous, a gargantuan river system flowed
across the region from modern day Egypt to Morocco. The whole world at that time
would look rather different to us. The continents had yet to assume
their current positions. Extreme temperatures were common and fierce storms made life unpredictable. Dinosaurs flourished on land, pterosaurs roamed the skies, and giant marine reptiles and sharks
swam in warm seas. Small mammals, our ancestors,
lived quite literally in the shadow of these extraordinary creatures. In this world of huge predators, the River of Giants, which is what some call this region
of what is now northern Africa, stood out as particularly dangerous. In most ecosystems, it's lonely at
the top of the food chain. There usually isn't enough prey
to sustain many predators. Yet an incredible variety of aquatic
prey species in the river-based ecosystem may have allowed a large and diverse
population of apex predators to coexist. We know this thanks to a wealth of fossils
we found in an area called the Kem Kem Beds. Many of the predators we've discovered
had head and body shapes that made them uniquely adapted
to hunt the different types and sizes of aquatic prey. This allowed many Kem Kem predators to
take full advantage of the one abundant food source
in this environment: fish. This also allowed them 
to avoid direct competition with the predators going after
land-loving animals. Prey species in the river system had to
contend with attacks from all sides, including from above. Flying reptiles dominated the skies. Alanqa Saharica had a wingspan of
up to nine meters, and long slender jaws that helped it
snatch fish and small terrestrial animals. At least seven different types 
of crocodile-like predators patrolled the waterways, including the roughly 
ten-meter-long Elosuchus. And multiple species of T-rex-sized
carnivorous dinosaurs called theropods, lived side by side. In the River of Giants,
Spinosaurus was king. This 15-meter-long dinosaur was even
longer than T-rex, with short muscular hind legs, a flexible tail, and broad feet. It's two-meter-high sail warned
other creatures of its fearsome size and may have also been 
used to attract mates. Spinosaurus' long slender jaws were spiked
with conical teeth, perfect for swiftly clamping down
on slippery aquatic prey. This apex predator, 
as well as its ecosystem, is unparalleled in the history
of life on Earth. All that's left of these 
fearsome predators are fossils. About 93 million years ago, 
sea levels rose, submerging the Kem Kem region
in a shallow sea. Tens of millions of years later, an asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions, and associated changes in climate wiped out the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and
many other groups of animals and plants, including their unique ecoysystems. That mass extinction paved the way
for the rise of new kinds of birds, larger mammals, and eventually us.

**Transcript**:
There are few places on Earth 
less hospitable to life than the bone-dry Sahara Desert. Yet it wasn't always this way. 100 million years ago, during a period
known as the Mid-Cretaceous, a gargantuan river system flowed
across the region from modern day Egypt to Morocco. The whole world at that time
would look rather different to us. The continents had yet to assume
their current positions. Extreme temperatures were common and fierce storms made life unpredictable. Dinosaurs flourished on land, pterosaurs roamed the skies, and giant marine reptiles and sharks
swam in warm seas. Small mammals, our ancestors,
lived quite literally in the shadow of these extraordinary creatures. In this world of huge predators, the River of Giants, which is what some call this region
of what is now northern Africa, stood out as particularly dangerous. In most ecosystems, it's lonely at
the top of the food chain. There usually isn't enough prey
to sustain many predators. Yet an incredible variety of aquatic
prey species in the river-based ecosystem may have allowed a large and diverse
population of apex predators to coexist. We know this thanks to a wealth of fossils
we found in an area called the Kem Kem Beds. Many of the predators we've discovered
had head and body shapes that made them uniquely adapted
to hunt the different types and sizes of aquatic prey. This allowed many Kem Kem predators to
take full advantage of the one abundant food source
in this environment: fish. This also allowed them 
to avoid direct competition with the predators going after
land-loving animals. Prey species in the river system had to
contend with attacks from all sides, including from above. Flying reptiles dominated the skies. Alanqa Saharica had a wingspan of
up to nine meters, and long slender jaws that helped it
snatch fish and small terrestrial animals. At least seven different types 
of crocodile-like predators patrolled the waterways, including the roughly 
ten-meter-long Elosuchus. And multiple species of T-rex-sized
carnivorous dinosaurs called theropods, lived side by side. In the River of Giants,
Spinosaurus was king. This 15-meter-long dinosaur was even
longer than T-rex, with short muscular hind legs, a flexible tail, and broad feet. It's two-meter-high sail warned
other creatures of its fearsome size and may have also been 
used to attract mates. Spinosaurus' long slender jaws were spiked
with conical teeth, perfect for swiftly clamping down
on slippery aquatic prey. This apex predator, 
as well as its ecosystem, is unparalleled in the history
of life on Earth. All that's left of these 
fearsome predators are fossils. About 93 million years ago, 
sea levels rose, submerging the Kem Kem region
in a shallow sea. Tens of millions of years later, an asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions, and associated changes in climate wiped out the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and
many other groups of animals and plants, including their unique ecoysystems. That mass extinction paved the way
for the rise of new kinds of birds, larger mammals, and eventually us.

**Transcript**:
85% of the matter in our universe
is a mystery. We don't know what it's made of,
which is why we call it dark matter. But we know it's out there because we
can observe its gravitational attraction on galaxies and other celestial objects. We've yet to directly observe dark matter, but scientists theorize that we may
actually be able to create it in the most powerful particle collider
in the world. That's the 27 kilometer-long
Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, in Geneva, Switzerland. So how would that work? In the LHC, two proton beams
move in opposite directions and are accelerated 
to near the speed of light. At four collision points, the beams cross
and protons smash into each other. Protons are made of much smaller
components called quarks and gluons In most ordinary collisions, the two
protons pass through each other without any significant outcome. However, in about 
one in a million collisions, two components hit each other
so violently, that most of the collision energy
is set free producing thousands of new particles. It's only in these collisions that very
massive particles, like the theorized dark matter,
can be produced. The collision points 
are surrounded by detectors containing about 100 million sensors. Like huge three-dimensional cameras, they gather information 
on those new particles, including their trajectory, electrical charge, and energy. Once processed, the computers can depict
a collision as an image. Each line is the path 
of a different particle, and different types of particles
are color-coded. Data from the detectors 
allows scientists to determine what each of these particles is, things like photons and electrons. Now, the detectors take snapshots of about
a billion of these collisions per second to find signs of extremely rare
massive particles. To add to the difficulty, the particles we're looking for 
may be unstable and decay into more familiar particles
before reaching the sensors. Take, for example, the Higgs boson, a long-theorized particle that wasn't
observed until 2012. The odds of a given collision producing
a Higgs boson are about one in 10 billion, and it only lasts for 
a tiny fraction of a second before decaying. But scientists developed theoretical 
models to tell them what to look for. For the Higgs, they thought it would
sometimes decay into two photons. So they first examined only 
the high-energy events that included two photons. But there's a problem here. There are innumerable 
particle interactions that can produce two random photons. So how do you separate out the Higgs
from everything else? The answer is mass. The information gathered by the detectors
allows the scientists to go a step back and determine the mass of whatever it was
that produced two photons. They put that mass value into a graph and then repeat the process
for all events with two photons. The vast majority of these events
are just random photon observations, what scientists call background events. But when a Higgs boson is produced
and decays into two photons, the mass always comes out to be the same. Therefore, the tell-tale sign
of the Higgs boson would be a little bump sitting on top
of the background. It takes billions of observations
before a bump like this can appear, and it's only considered 
a meaningful result if that bump becomes significantly 
higher than the background. In the case of the Higgs boson, the scientists at the LHC announced their
groundbreaking result when there was only 
a one in 3 million chance this bump could have 
appeared by a statistical fluke. So back to the dark matter. If the LHC's proton beams have enough
energy to produce it, that's probably an even rarer occurrence
than the Higgs boson. So it takes quadrillions of collisions
combined with theoretical models to even start to look. That's what the LHC is currently doing. By generating a mountain of data, we're hoping to find more tiny bumps

**Transcript**:
85% of the matter in our universe
is a mystery. We don't know what it's made of,
which is why we call it dark matter. But we know it's out there because we
can observe its gravitational attraction on galaxies and other celestial objects. We've yet to directly observe dark matter, but scientists theorize that we may
actually be able to create it in the most powerful particle collider
in the world. That's the 27 kilometer-long
Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, in Geneva, Switzerland. So how would that work? In the LHC, two proton beams
move in opposite directions and are accelerated 
to near the speed of light. At four collision points, the beams cross
and protons smash into each other. Protons are made of much smaller
components called quarks and gluons In most ordinary collisions, the two
protons pass through each other without any significant outcome. However, in about 
one in a million collisions, two components hit each other
so violently, that most of the collision energy
is set free producing thousands of new particles. It's only in these collisions that very
massive particles, like the theorized dark matter,
can be produced. The collision points 
are surrounded by detectors containing about 100 million sensors. Like huge three-dimensional cameras, they gather information 
on those new particles, including their trajectory, electrical charge, and energy. Once processed, the computers can depict
a collision as an image. Each line is the path 
of a different particle, and different types of particles
are color-coded. Data from the detectors 
allows scientists to determine what each of these particles is, things like photons and electrons. Now, the detectors take snapshots of about
a billion of these collisions per second to find signs of extremely rare
massive particles. To add to the difficulty, the particles we're looking for 
may be unstable and decay into more familiar particles
before reaching the sensors. Take, for example, the Higgs boson, a long-theorized particle that wasn't
observed until 2012. The odds of a given collision producing
a Higgs boson are about one in 10 billion, and it only lasts for 
a tiny fraction of a second before decaying. But scientists developed theoretical 
models to tell them what to look for. For the Higgs, they thought it would
sometimes decay into two photons. So they first examined only 
the high-energy events that included two photons. But there's a problem here. There are innumerable 
particle interactions that can produce two random photons. So how do you separate out the Higgs
from everything else? The answer is mass. The information gathered by the detectors
allows the scientists to go a step back and determine the mass of whatever it was
that produced two photons. They put that mass value into a graph and then repeat the process
for all events with two photons. The vast majority of these events
are just random photon observations, what scientists call background events. But when a Higgs boson is produced
and decays into two photons, the mass always comes out to be the same. Therefore, the tell-tale sign
of the Higgs boson would be a little bump sitting on top
of the background. It takes billions of observations
before a bump like this can appear, and it's only considered 
a meaningful result if that bump becomes significantly 
higher than the background. In the case of the Higgs boson, the scientists at the LHC announced their
groundbreaking result when there was only 
a one in 3 million chance this bump could have 
appeared by a statistical fluke. So back to the dark matter. If the LHC's proton beams have enough
energy to produce it, that's probably an even rarer occurrence
than the Higgs boson. So it takes quadrillions of collisions
combined with theoretical models to even start to look. That's what the LHC is currently doing. By generating a mountain of data, we're hoping to find more tiny bumps
in graphs that will provide evidence for
yet unknown particles, like dark matter. Or maybe what we'll 
find won't be dark matter, but something else that would reshape our understanding 
of how the universe works entirely. That's part of the fun at this point. We have no idea what we're
going to find.

**Transcript**:
In the early hours of August 13, 1961, East German construction workers flanked
by soldiers and police began tearing up streets and erecting
barriers throughout the city of Berlin and its surroundings. This night marked the beginning of one
of history's most infamous dividing lines, the Berlin Wall. Construction on the wall continued
for the next decade as it cut through neighborhoods, separated families, and divided not just Germany,
but the world. To understand how we got to this point, we have to go back to World War II. America, Britain, and France joined forces with the Soviet Union
against the Axis Powers. After they defeated Nazi Germany, each of the victorious nations occupied
part of the country. The division was meant to be temporary, but the former allies found 
themselves at odds over their visions for post-war Europe. While Western powers promoted
liberal market economies, the Soviet Union sought to surround itself
with obedient Communist nations, including a weakened Germany. As their relations deteriorated, the Federal Republic of Germany
was formed in the West while the Soviets established the
German Democratic Republic in the East. The Soviet satellite countries restricted
Western trade and movement, so a virtually impassable border formed. It became known as the Iron Curtain. In the former German capital of Berlin,
things were particularly complicated. Although the city lay fully within
the East German territory of the GDR, the post-war agreement gave the allies
joint administration. So America, Britain, and France created
a Democratic enclave in Berlin's western districts. While East Germans were officially banned
from leaving the country, in Berlin, it was simply 
a matter of walking, or riding a subway, streetcar or bus, to the Western half, then traveling on to West Germany
or beyond. This open border posed a problem
for the East German leadership. They had staked a claim to represent
the Communist resistance against Hitler and portrayed Western Germany as
a continuation of the Nazi regime. While the U.S. and its allies poured
money into West Germany's reconstruction, the Soviet Union extracted resources
from the East as war reparations, making its planned economy 
even less competitive. Life in East Germany passed under
the watchful eye of the Stasi, the secret police whose wiretaps 
and informants monitored citizens for any hint of disloyalty. While there was free health care
and education in the East, the West boasted higher salaries, more consumer goods, and greater personal freedom. By 1961, about 3.5 million people,
nearly 20% of the East German population, had left, 
including many young professionals. To prevent further losses, East Germany decided to close the border,
and that's where the Berlin Wall came in. Extending for 43 kilometers
through Berlin, and a further 112 through East Germany, the initial barrier consisted
of barbed wire and mesh fencing. Some Berliners escaped by
jumping over the wire or leaving from windows, but as the wall expanded,
this became more difficult. By 1965, 106 kilometers of 3.6-meter-high
concrete barricades had been added topped with a smooth 
pipe to prevent climbing. Over the coming years, the barrier
was strengthened with spike strips, guard dogs, and even landmines, along with 302 watchtowers
and 20 bunkers. A parallel fence in the rear set off
a 100-meter area called the death strip. There, all buildings were demolished
and the ground covered with sand to provide a clear line of sight
for the hundreds of guards ordered to shoot anyone 
attempting to cross. Nevertheless, nearly 5,000 people
in total managed to flee East Germany between 1961 and 1989. Some were diplomats or athletes
who defected while abroad, but others were ordinary citizens who
dug tunnels, swam across canals, flew hot air balloons, or even crashed a stolen tank
through the wall. Yet the risk was great. Over 138 people died
while attempting escape. Some shot in full view of West Germans
powerless to help them. The wall stabilized East Germany's economy
by preventing its work force from leaving, but tarnished its reputation, becoming a global symbol 
of Communist repression. As part of reconciliation with the East, the Basic Treaty of 1972 recognized
East Germany pragmatically while West Germany retained its hope
for eventual reunification. Although the Eastern regime
gradually allowed family visits, it tried to discourage people
from exercising these rights with an arduous bureaucratic process
and high fees. Nonetheless, it was still overwhelmed
by applications. By the end of the 1980's, the liberalization of 
other Eastern Bloc regimes caused mass demonstrations
for free travel and demands for democracy. On the evening of November 9, 1989, East Germany tried to defuse tension
by making travel permits easier to obtain. But the announcement brought thousands
of East Berliners to the border crossing points in the wall, forcing the surprised guards to open
the gates immediately. Rejoicing crowds poured into West Berlin as people from both sides danced 
atop the wall. And others began to demolish it 
with whatever tools they could find. Although the border guards initially
tried to maintain order, it was soon clear that the years
of division were at an end. After four decades, Germany was
officially reunified in October 1990. And the Soviet Union fell soon after. Today, parts of the wall still 
stand as a reminder that any barriers we put up 
to impede freedom, we can also break down.

**Transcript**:
In the early hours of August 13, 1961, East German construction workers flanked
by soldiers and police began tearing up streets and erecting
barriers throughout the city of Berlin and its surroundings. This night marked the beginning of one
of history's most infamous dividing lines, the Berlin Wall. Construction on the wall continued
for the next decade as it cut through neighborhoods, separated families, and divided not just Germany,
but the world. To understand how we got to this point, we have to go back to World War II. America, Britain, and France joined forces with the Soviet Union
against the Axis Powers. After they defeated Nazi Germany, each of the victorious nations occupied
part of the country. The division was meant to be temporary, but the former allies found 
themselves at odds over their visions for post-war Europe. While Western powers promoted
liberal market economies, the Soviet Union sought to surround itself
with obedient Communist nations, including a weakened Germany. As their relations deteriorated, the Federal Republic of Germany
was formed in the West while the Soviets established the
German Democratic Republic in the East. The Soviet satellite countries restricted
Western trade and movement, so a virtually impassable border formed. It became known as the Iron Curtain. In the former German capital of Berlin,
things were particularly complicated. Although the city lay fully within
the East German territory of the GDR, the post-war agreement gave the allies
joint administration. So America, Britain, and France created
a Democratic enclave in Berlin's western districts. While East Germans were officially banned
from leaving the country, in Berlin, it was simply 
a matter of walking, or riding a subway, streetcar or bus, to the Western half, then traveling on to West Germany
or beyond. This open border posed a problem
for the East German leadership. They had staked a claim to represent
the Communist resistance against Hitler and portrayed Western Germany as
a continuation of the Nazi regime. While the U.S. and its allies poured
money into West Germany's reconstruction, the Soviet Union extracted resources
from the East as war reparations, making its planned economy 
even less competitive. Life in East Germany passed under
the watchful eye of the Stasi, the secret police whose wiretaps 
and informants monitored citizens for any hint of disloyalty. While there was free health care
and education in the East, the West boasted higher salaries, more consumer goods, and greater personal freedom. By 1961, about 3.5 million people,
nearly 20% of the East German population, had left, 
including many young professionals. To prevent further losses, East Germany decided to close the border,
and that's where the Berlin Wall came in. Extending for 43 kilometers
through Berlin, and a further 112 through East Germany, the initial barrier consisted
of barbed wire and mesh fencing. Some Berliners escaped by
jumping over the wire or leaving from windows, but as the wall expanded,
this became more difficult. By 1965, 106 kilometers of 3.6-meter-high
concrete barricades had been added topped with a smooth 
pipe to prevent climbing. Over the coming years, the barrier
was strengthened with spike strips, guard dogs, and even landmines, along with 302 watchtowers
and 20 bunkers. A parallel fence in the rear set off
a 100-meter area called the death strip. There, all buildings were demolished
and the ground covered with sand to provide a clear line of sight
for the hundreds of guards ordered to shoot anyone 
attempting to cross. Nevertheless, nearly 5,000 people
in total managed to flee East Germany between 1961 and 1989. Some were diplomats or athletes
who defected while abroad, but others were ordinary citizens who
dug tunnels, swam across canals, flew hot air balloons, or even crashed a stolen tank
through the wall. Yet the risk was great. Over 138 people died
while attempting escape. Some shot in full view of West Germans
powerless to help them. The wall stabilized East Germany's economy
by preventing its work force from leaving, but tarnished its reputation, becoming a global symbol 
of Communist repression. As part of reconciliation with the East, the Basic Treaty of 1972 recognized
East Germany pragmatically while West Germany retained its hope
for eventual reunification. Although the Eastern regime
gradually allowed family visits, it tried to discourage people
from exercising these rights with an arduous bureaucratic process
and high fees. Nonetheless, it was still overwhelmed
by applications. By the end of the 1980's, the liberalization of 
other Eastern Bloc regimes caused mass demonstrations
for free travel and demands for democracy. On the evening of November 9, 1989, East Germany tried to defuse tension
by making travel permits easier to obtain. But the announcement brought thousands
of East Berliners to the border crossing points in the wall, forcing the surprised guards to open
the gates immediately. Rejoicing crowds poured into West Berlin as people from both sides danced 
atop the wall. And others began to demolish it 
with whatever tools they could find. Although the border guards initially
tried to maintain order, it was soon clear that the years
of division were at an end. After four decades, Germany was
officially reunified in October 1990. And the Soviet Union fell soon after. Today, parts of the wall still 
stand as a reminder that any barriers we put up 
to impede freedom, we can also break down.

**Transcript**:
A solar eclipse happens when the moon’s
shadow falls somewhere on the surface of Earth And a lunar eclipse is the opposite -- when
the Earth’s shadow falls on the moon The two sections of the shadow, the dark umbra
and the partially shaded penumbra, their placement determines which type of eclipse
we can see from Earth. But not all eclipses are made equal. The most spectacular, the one for your bucket
list is a total eclipse of the sun. A total solar eclipse begins as a partial
eclipse. You’ll notice trees projecting the crescent
sun, and shadows becoming sharper than normal. The landscape darkens to a bluish-grey and
 you’ll start to feel the temperature drop. From the west, the moon’s shadow rushes
toward you like a silent storm. Look up and you’ll see the last sliver of
the sun sparkling like a diamond ring, before it’s broken into a string of beads
by the moon’s rough terrain. Now you can see the pearly glow of the sun’s
corona and the pink and red light from the hydrogen gas of the chromosphere. Together these make up the sun’s outer atmosphere,
and a total solar eclipse is the only occasion you have to lay eyes on it. This is totality and if you get a chance
to see it, you should. The moon orbits earth every 29.5 days, but
we don’t get eclipses every month. That’s because the moon’s orbit is not
in line with earth’s orbit. it’s tilted about 5 degrees. That doesn’t seem like much but keep in
mind that the scale of the model we’re showing to you is way off. If the Earth and moon are this size, the
distance between them should be around 10 ft. At this distance, 5 degrees is enough to keep
the moon’s shadow off of Earth and the Earth’s shadow off the moon most months. So why do we ever get eclipses? Because there are two points where the moon’s
orbit crosses the sun’s plane, called nodes. And as the Earth moves along its annual orbit,
those points line up with the sun about twice a year. As the moon passes between the sun and Earth
at that time, we get a solar eclipse. When it’s behind Earth at that time, we
get a lunar eclipse. There are a ton of orbital quirks that make
predicting eclipses really complicated, but in general we’ll have a few solar and lunar
eclipses of some sort and a few lunar eclipses of some sort every year. But you’re more likely to see a total lunar
eclipse in your lifetime than a total solar one. The totality of a lunar eclipse can last well
over an hour and it’s viewable for anyone on the night side of earth. The moon often turns red during a total lunar
eclipse because our planet’s atmosphere scatters the shorter bluer wavelengths of
light, while the longer, redder wavelengths pass through. Or to put it another way, a total lunar eclipse
projects all of the world’s sunsets and sunrises onto the moon. Total solar eclipses seem much more rare because
totality lasts just a few minutes, and although Earth gets a total solar eclipse every 18
months on average, each one is only viewable by less than half a percent of Earth’s surface. Eclipse chasers travel all over the world
to put themselves in the path of the shadow. In a total solar eclipse, the moon precisely
covers the sun from the vantage point of some place on Earth. This is possible because by coincidence, the
sun and the moon appear to be about the same size in our sky. While the sun is 400 times bigger than the
moon, it’s also about 400 times farther away. But this alignment isn’t constant. the moon has an elliptical orbit. Its size varies about 12% throughout a month. When it’s closer to us, we can get total
solar eclipses, but less than 30% of solar eclipses are total. More often, we get partial eclipses, where
the alignment is a bit off, or annular eclipses, where the moon is too far away to fully block
the sun, leaving a ring of sunlight around the moon. In the far future, earth will only get annular
and partial solar eclipses because our moon is moving further away. We know that because Buzz Aldrin and Neil
Armstrong left mirrors on the moon in 1969. Astronomers bounce lasers off those mirrors
to measure the moon’s distance. And that’s how they found out that the moon
is moving away from Earth by more than 3 cm per year. So in a billion years or so, whatever creatures
live here will witness Earth’s very last total solar eclipse. “We can see on the Radio One screen, a fantastic
total solar eclipse taken from the pictures above the clouds.” “This is just fantastic.” A lot of early civilizations feared eclipses. They were often seen as an attack on the sun
or moon by the forces of darkness. But now that we understand our place in space,
eclipses are an occasion for awe, and for gratitude. All over the galaxy rocks are casting shadows
on other rocks. But only here, as far as we know, is there
someone to notice them.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A solar eclipse happens when the moon’s
shadow falls somewhere on the surface of Earth And a lunar eclipse is the opposite -- when
the Earth’s shadow falls on the moon The two sections of the shadow, the dark umbra
and the partially shaded penumbra, their placement determines which type of eclipse
we can see from Earth. But not all eclipses are made equal. The most spectacular, the one for your bucket
list is a total eclipse of the sun. A total solar eclipse begins as a partial
eclipse. You’ll notice trees projecting the crescent
sun, and shadows becoming sharper than normal. The landscape darkens to a bluish-grey and
 you’ll start to feel the temperature drop. From the west, the moon’s shadow rushes
toward you like a silent storm. Look up and you’ll see the last sliver of
the sun sparkling like a diamond ring, before it’s broken into a string of beads
by the moon’s rough terrain. Now you can see the pearly glow of the sun’s
corona and the pink and red light from the hydrogen gas of the chromosphere. Together these make up the sun’s outer atmosphere,
and a total solar eclipse is the only occasion you have to lay eyes on it. This is totality and if you get a chance
to see it, you should. The moon orbits earth every 29.5 days, but
we don’t get eclipses every month. That’s because the moon’s orbit is not
in line with earth’s orbit. it’s tilted about 5 degrees. That doesn’t seem like much but keep in
mind that the scale of the model we’re showing to you is way off. If the Earth and moon are this size, the
distance between them should be around 10 ft. At this distance, 5 degrees is enough to keep
the moon’s shadow off of Earth and the Earth’s shadow off the moon most months. So why do we ever get eclipses? Because there are two points where the moon’s
orbit crosses the sun’s plane, called nodes. And as the Earth moves along its annual orbit,
those points line up with the sun about twice a year. As the moon passes between the sun and Earth
at that time, we get a solar eclipse. When it’s behind Earth at that time, we
get a lunar eclipse. There are a ton of orbital quirks that make
predicting eclipses really complicated, but in general we’ll have a few solar and lunar
eclipses of some sort and a few lunar eclipses of some sort every year. But you’re more likely to see a total lunar
eclipse in your lifetime than a total solar one. The totality of a lunar eclipse can last well
over an hour and it’s viewable for anyone on the night side of earth. The moon often turns red during a total lunar
eclipse because our planet’s atmosphere scatters the shorter bluer wavelengths of
light, while the longer, redder wavelengths pass through. Or to put it another way, a total lunar eclipse
projects all of the world’s sunsets and sunrises onto the moon. Total solar eclipses seem much more rare because
totality lasts just a few minutes, and although Earth gets a total solar eclipse every 18
months on average, each one is only viewable by less than half a percent of Earth’s surface. Eclipse chasers travel all over the world
to put themselves in the path of the shadow. In a total solar eclipse, the moon precisely
covers the sun from the vantage point of some place on Earth. This is possible because by coincidence, the
sun and the moon appear to be about the same size in our sky. While the sun is 400 times bigger than the
moon, it’s also about 400 times farther away. But this alignment isn’t constant. the moon has an elliptical orbit. Its size varies about 12% throughout a month. When it’s closer to us, we can get total
solar eclipses, but less than 30% of solar eclipses are total. More often, we get partial eclipses, where
the alignment is a bit off, or annular eclipses, where the moon is too far away to fully block
the sun, leaving a ring of sunlight around the moon. In the far future, earth will only get annular
and partial solar eclipses because our moon is moving further away. We know that because Buzz Aldrin and Neil
Armstrong left mirrors on the moon in 1969. Astronomers bounce lasers off those mirrors
to measure the moon’s distance. And that’s how they found out that the moon
is moving away from Earth by more than 3 cm per year. So in a billion years or so, whatever creatures
live here will witness Earth’s very last total solar eclipse. “We can see on the Radio One screen, a fantastic
total solar eclipse taken from the pictures above the clouds.” “This is just fantastic.” A lot of early civilizations feared eclipses. They were often seen as an attack on the sun
or moon by the forces of darkness. But now that we understand our place in space,
eclipses are an occasion for awe, and for gratitude. All over the galaxy rocks are casting shadows

**Transcript**:
Fish are in trouble. The cod population off Canada's East Coast
collapsed in the 1990s, intense recreational 
and commercial fishing has decimated goliath grouper populations
in South Florida, and most populations of tuna
have plummeted by over 50%, with the Southern Atlantic bluefin
on the verge of extinction. Those are just a couple of many examples. Overfishing is happening 
all over the world. How did this happen? When some people think of fishing, they imagine relaxing in a boat
and patiently reeling in the day's catch. But modern industrial fishing,
the kind that stocks our grocery shelves, looks more like warfare. In fact, the technologies they employ
were developed for war. Radar, sonar, helicopters, and spotter planes are all used to guide factory ships
towards dwindling schools of fish. Long lines with hundreds
of hooks or huge nets round up massive amounts of fish,
along with other species, like seabirds, turtles, and dolphins. And fish are hauled up onto giant boats, complete with onboard flash freezing
and processing facilities. All of these technologies have enabled
us to catch fish at greater depths and farther out at sea than ever before. And as the distance and depth
of fishing have expanded, so has the variety of species we target. For example, the Patagonian toothfish
neither sounds nor looks very appetizing. And fishermen ignored it until
the late 1970s. Then it was rebranded and marketed
to chefs in the U.S. as Chilean sea bass, despite the animal actually 
being a type of cod. Soon it was popping up in markets
all over the world and is now a delicacy. Unfortunately, these deep water fish 
don't reproduce until they're at least ten years old, making them extremely vulnerable
to overfishing when the young are caught before they've
had the chance to spawn. Consumer taste and prices can
also have harmful effects. For example, shark fin soup is considered
such a delicacy in China and Vietnam that the fin has become 
the most profitable part of the shark. This leads many fishermen to fill
their boats with fins leaving millions of dead sharks behind. The problems aren't unique
to toothfish and sharks. Almost 31% of the world's fish populations
are overfished, and another 58% are fished
at the maximum sustainable level. Wild fish simply can't reproduce
as fast as 7 billion people can eat them. Fishing also has impacts
on broader ecosystems. Wild shrimp are typically caught by
dragging nets the size of a football field along the ocean bottom, disrupting or destroying
seafloor habitats. The catch is often as little as 5% shrimp. The rest is by-catch, unwanted 
animals that are thrown back dead. And coastal shrimp farming isn't
much better. Mangroves are bulldozed to make room
for shrimp farms, robbing coastal communities of storm
protection and natural water filtration and depriving fish of key
nursery habitats. So what does it look like to give
fish a break and let them recover? Protection can take many forms. In national waters,
governments can set limits about how, when, where, 
and how much fishing occurs, with restrictions on certain 
boats and equipment. Harmful practices, such as bottom 
trawling, can be banned altogether, and we can establish marine reserves
closed to all fishing to help ecosystems restore themselves. There's also a role for consumer awareness
and boycotts to reduce wasteful practices, like shark finning, and push fishing industries towards
more sustainable practices. Past interventions have successfully
helped depleted fish populations recover. There are many solutions. The best approach for each fishery
must be considered based on science, respect for the local communities
that rely on the ocean, and for fish as wild animals. And then the rules must be enforced. International collaboration is often
needed, too, because fish don't care about our borders. We need to end overfishing. Ecosystems, food security, jobs, economies, and coastal cultures all depend on it.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Fish are in trouble. The cod population off Canada's East Coast
collapsed in the 1990s, intense recreational 
and commercial fishing has decimated goliath grouper populations
in South Florida, and most populations of tuna
have plummeted by over 50%, with the Southern Atlantic bluefin
on the verge of extinction. Those are just a couple of many examples. Overfishing is happening 
all over the world. How did this happen? When some people think of fishing, they imagine relaxing in a boat
and patiently reeling in the day's catch. But modern industrial fishing,
the kind that stocks our grocery shelves, looks more like warfare. In fact, the technologies they employ
were developed for war. Radar, sonar, helicopters, and spotter planes are all used to guide factory ships
towards dwindling schools of fish. Long lines with hundreds
of hooks or huge nets round up massive amounts of fish,
along with other species, like seabirds, turtles, and dolphins. And fish are hauled up onto giant boats, complete with onboard flash freezing
and processing facilities. All of these technologies have enabled
us to catch fish at greater depths and farther out at sea than ever before. And as the distance and depth
of fishing have expanded, so has the variety of species we target. For example, the Patagonian toothfish
neither sounds nor looks very appetizing. And fishermen ignored it until
the late 1970s. Then it was rebranded and marketed
to chefs in the U.S. as Chilean sea bass, despite the animal actually 
being a type of cod. Soon it was popping up in markets
all over the world and is now a delicacy. Unfortunately, these deep water fish 
don't reproduce until they're at least ten years old, making them extremely vulnerable
to overfishing when the young are caught before they've
had the chance to spawn. Consumer taste and prices can
also have harmful effects. For example, shark fin soup is considered
such a delicacy in China and Vietnam that the fin has become 
the most profitable part of the shark. This leads many fishermen to fill
their boats with fins leaving millions of dead sharks behind. The problems aren't unique
to toothfish and sharks. Almost 31% of the world's fish populations
are overfished, and another 58% are fished
at the maximum sustainable level. Wild fish simply can't reproduce
as fast as 7 billion people can eat them. Fishing also has impacts
on broader ecosystems. Wild shrimp are typically caught by
dragging nets the size of a football field along the ocean bottom, disrupting or destroying
seafloor habitats. The catch is often as little as 5% shrimp. The rest is by-catch, unwanted 
animals that are thrown back dead. And coastal shrimp farming isn't
much better. Mangroves are bulldozed to make room
for shrimp farms, robbing coastal communities of storm
protection and natural water filtration and depriving fish of key
nursery habitats. So what does it look like to give
fish a break and let them recover? Protection can take many forms. In national waters,
governments can set limits about how, when, where, 
and how much fishing occurs, with restrictions on certain 
boats and equipment. Harmful practices, such as bottom 
trawling, can be banned altogether, and we can establish marine reserves
closed to all fishing to help ecosystems restore themselves. There's also a role for consumer awareness
and boycotts to reduce wasteful practices, like shark finning, and push fishing industries towards
more sustainable practices. Past interventions have successfully
helped depleted fish populations recover. There are many solutions. The best approach for each fishery
must be considered based on science, respect for the local communities
that rely on the ocean, and for fish as wild animals. And then the rules must be enforced. International collaboration is often
needed, too, because fish don't care about our borders. We need to end overfishing. Ecosystems, food security, jobs, economies, and coastal cultures all depend on it.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Take a look at the water in this glass. Refreshing, hydrating, and invaluable
to your survival. Before you take a sip, though, how do you know that the water inside
is free from disease-causing organisms and pollutants? One out of ten people in the world
can't actually be sure that their water is clean 
and safe to drink. Why is that? Inadequate sanitation, poor protection of drinking water sources, and improper hygiene often lead to sewage 
and feces-contaminated water. That's the ideal breeding ground
for dangerous bacteria, viruses, and parasites. And the effects of these pathogens
are staggering. Diarrheal disease from unsafe water is one
of the leading causes of death around the world for children under five. And according to a U.N. report from 2010, microbial water-borne illnesses killed
more people per year than war. Proper treatment processes, though,
can address these threats. They usually have three parts: sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. Once water has been collected
in a treatment facility, it's ready for cleaning. The first step, sedimentation,
just takes time. The water sits undisturbed, allowing
heavier particles to sink to the bottom. Often, though, particles 
are just too small to be removed by sedimentation alone and need to be filtered. Gravity pulls the water downward through
layers of sand that catch leftover particles 
in their pores, prepping the water 
for its final treatment, a dose of disinfectant. Chemicals, primarily forms 
of chlorine and ozone, are mixed in to kill off any pathogens and to disinfect pipes 
and storage systems. Chlorine is highly effective in destroying
water's living organisms, but its use remains government-regulated because it has potentially harmful
chemical byproducts. And if an imbalance of chlorine occurs
during the disinfection process, it can trigger other chemical reactions. For example, 
levels of chlorine byproducts, like trihalomethanes, could skyrocket,
leading to pipe corrosion and the release of iron, copper,
and lead into drinking water. Water contamination from these
and other sources including leaching, chemical spills, and runoffs, has been linked 
to long-term health effects, like cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and miscarriage. Unfortunately, analyzing the exact risks of chemically contaminated 
water is difficult. So while it's clear that disinfectants
make us safer by removing disease-causing pathogens, experts have yet 
to determine the full scope of how the chemical cocktail 
in our drinking water really impacts human health. So how can you tell whether the water
you have access to, whether from a tap or otherwise, is drinkable? Firstly, too much turbidity, trace organic compounds, or high-density heavy metals like arsenic,
chromium, or lead, mean that the water 
is unsuitable for consumption. A lot of contaminants, 
like lead or arsenic, won't be obvious without tests, but some clues, like cloudiness, brown or yellow coloration, a foul odor, or an excessive chlorine smell can indicate the need 
to investigate further. Water testing kits can go a step further and confirm the presence of many different
contaminants and chemicals. With many types of contamination, there are ways of treating water where 
it's used instead of close to its source. Point-of-use treatment has actually
been around for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians boiled away many
organic contaminants with the sun's heat. And in Ancient Greece, Hippocrates
designed a bag that trapped bad tasting 
sediments from water. Today, point-of-use processes usually
involve ionization to lower mineral content. They also use adsorption filtration, where a porous material
called activated carbon strains the water to remove contaminants
and chemical byproducts. While it's not always an effective
long-term solution, point-of-use treatment is portable,
easy to install, and adaptable. And in regions where large-scale
systems are unavailable, or where water has been contaminated
further along its journey, these systems can mean the difference
between life and death. Clean water remains a precious
and often scarce commodity. There are nearly 800 million of us who
still don't have regular access to it. The good news is that continued
developments in water treatment, both on a large and small scale, can alleviate a lot of unsafe conditions. Implementing proper systems where
they're needed and paying careful attention
to the ones already in place will fulfill one of the most basic
of our human needs.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 5, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Take a look at the water in this glass. Refreshing, hydrating, and invaluable
to your survival. Before you take a sip, though, how do you know that the water inside
is free from disease-causing organisms and pollutants? One out of ten people in the world
can't actually be sure that their water is clean 
and safe to drink. Why is that? Inadequate sanitation, poor protection of drinking water sources, and improper hygiene often lead to sewage 
and feces-contaminated water. That's the ideal breeding ground
for dangerous bacteria, viruses, and parasites. And the effects of these pathogens
are staggering. Diarrheal disease from unsafe water is one
of the leading causes of death around the world for children under five. And according to a U.N. report from 2010, microbial water-borne illnesses killed
more people per year than war. Proper treatment processes, though,
can address these threats. They usually have three parts: sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. Once water has been collected
in a treatment facility, it's ready for cleaning. The first step, sedimentation,
just takes time. The water sits undisturbed, allowing
heavier particles to sink to the bottom. Often, though, particles 
are just too small to be removed by sedimentation alone and need to be filtered. Gravity pulls the water downward through
layers of sand that catch leftover particles 
in their pores, prepping the water 
for its final treatment, a dose of disinfectant. Chemicals, primarily forms 
of chlorine and ozone, are mixed in to kill off any pathogens and to disinfect pipes 
and storage systems. Chlorine is highly effective in destroying
water's living organisms, but its use remains government-regulated because it has potentially harmful
chemical byproducts. And if an imbalance of chlorine occurs
during the disinfection process, it can trigger other chemical reactions. For example, 
levels of chlorine byproducts, like trihalomethanes, could skyrocket,
leading to pipe corrosion and the release of iron, copper,
and lead into drinking water. Water contamination from these
and other sources including leaching, chemical spills, and runoffs, has been linked 
to long-term health effects, like cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and miscarriage. Unfortunately, analyzing the exact risks of chemically contaminated 
water is difficult. So while it's clear that disinfectants
make us safer by removing disease-causing pathogens, experts have yet 
to determine the full scope of how the chemical cocktail 
in our drinking water really impacts human health. So how can you tell whether the water
you have access to, whether from a tap or otherwise, is drinkable? Firstly, too much turbidity, trace organic compounds, or high-density heavy metals like arsenic,
chromium, or lead, mean that the water 
is unsuitable for consumption. A lot of contaminants, 
like lead or arsenic, won't be obvious without tests, but some clues, like cloudiness, brown or yellow coloration, a foul odor, or an excessive chlorine smell can indicate the need 
to investigate further. Water testing kits can go a step further and confirm the presence of many different
contaminants and chemicals. With many types of contamination, there are ways of treating water where 
it's used instead of close to its source. Point-of-use treatment has actually
been around for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians boiled away many
organic contaminants with the sun's heat. And in Ancient Greece, Hippocrates
designed a bag that trapped bad tasting 
sediments from water. Today, point-of-use processes usually
involve ionization to lower mineral content. They also use adsorption filtration, where a porous material
called activated carbon strains the water to remove contaminants
and chemical byproducts. While it's not always an effective
long-term solution, point-of-use treatment is portable,
easy to install, and adaptable. And in regions where large-scale
systems are unavailable, or where water has been contaminated
further along its journey, these systems can mean the difference
between life and death. Clean water remains a precious
and often scarce commodity. There are nearly 800 million of us who
still don't have regular access to it. The good news is that continued
developments in water treatment, both on a large and small scale, can alleviate a lot of unsafe conditions. Implementing proper systems where
they're needed and paying careful attention
to the ones already in place will fulfill one of the most basic
of our human needs.

**Transcript**:
Let’s face it. Butterflies get all the glory, fluttering
around with their flashy looks. But caterpillars? They’re more than just an awkward adolescent
phase. They do all the hard work, so that one day
they can look like this. As adults, butterflies really only have one
job: mating. They’re basically flying reproduction machines,
powered by sugar water. Their proboscis is made for sipping nectar. But that liquid diet doesn’t give them much
of the protein they need to make eggs. So that hungry, hungry caterpillar has a big
job to do. It’s not just eating for itself. It’s stockpiling the protein it will need
later on to make the next generation. It starts by eating its way out of the egg. No leftovers. Then it’s onto the main course. These pipevine swallowtail caterpillars are
chowing down on their favorite – and only – food: the pipevine. For a monarch caterpillar, it’s all about
the milkweed. In two weeks they’ll grow 20 times longer. That’s like a human baby growing as tall
as a three-story building. A caterpillar can’t see very well. So it uses antennae to smell for food. Not those big ones on top – those are for
feeling around. It’s the tiny ones right down there. It eats and eats and eats… storing up as
much protein as possible. Leaves are about one quarter protein. After packing on the pounds for a couple of
weeks, this monarch caterpillar is finally ready for the big day. It weaves a ball of silk on a branch. Then, it hooks onto it – with its backside. And lets go. Look through its skin. There’s something wiggling in there. The caterpillar pumps and pushes. Until… it splits open… shedding all traces of its youth… including its face. The outer skin hardens into the chrysalis
that protects the pupa inside. Its stomach shrinks. It’s giving up its gluttonous ways. When the butterfly emerges days later, it
uncurls its brand new proboscis – two pieces called galeae that have to be zipped together
into a single straw before the butterfly can use it. And it lets those glorious wings unfold. They’ll take it to find mates and a juicy
new plant to lay its eggs on, using that stored up protein. This complete metamorphosis is called holometaboly. Multiple lives in a single life. It takes a lot of work. And butterflies only live a few weeks. But this strategy is not as rare as you might
think. In the animal kingdom, it’s incredibly common. Mammals like us are the weird ones. After all, our face doesn't fall off when
we grow up. Hey! It’s Lauren. Can you spot the chrysalises hanging on this
branch? They need that camouflage. Otherwise they’d be sitting ducks for predators. Are you looking for something new? Try Above the Noise, a new series from KQED
and PBS Digital Studios that cuts through the hype of today’s headlines, with science. See you next time!

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Let’s face it. Butterflies get all the glory, fluttering
around with their flashy looks. But caterpillars? They’re more than just an awkward adolescent
phase. They do all the hard work, so that one day
they can look like this. As adults, butterflies really only have one
job: mating. They’re basically flying reproduction machines,
powered by sugar water. Their proboscis is made for sipping nectar. But that liquid diet doesn’t give them much
of the protein they need to make eggs. So that hungry, hungry caterpillar has a big
job to do. It’s not just eating for itself. It’s stockpiling the protein it will need
later on to make the next generation. It starts by eating its way out of the egg. No leftovers. Then it’s onto the main course. These pipevine swallowtail caterpillars are
chowing down on their favorite – and only – food: the pipevine. For a monarch caterpillar, it’s all about
the milkweed. In two weeks they’ll grow 20 times longer. That’s like a human baby growing as tall
as a three-story building. A caterpillar can’t see very well. So it uses antennae to smell for food. Not those big ones on top – those are for
feeling around. It’s the tiny ones right down there. It eats and eats and eats… storing up as
much protein as possible. Leaves are about one quarter protein. After packing on the pounds for a couple of
weeks, this monarch caterpillar is finally ready for the big day. It weaves a ball of silk on a branch. Then, it hooks onto it – with its backside. And lets go. Look through its skin. There’s something wiggling in there. The caterpillar pumps and pushes. Until… it splits open… shedding all traces of its youth… including its face. The outer skin hardens into the chrysalis
that protects the pupa inside. Its stomach shrinks. It’s giving up its gluttonous ways. When the butterfly emerges days later, it
uncurls its brand new proboscis – two pieces called galeae that have to be zipped together
into a single straw before the butterfly can use it. And it lets those glorious wings unfold. They’ll take it to find mates and a juicy
new plant to lay its eggs on, using that stored up protein. This complete metamorphosis is called holometaboly. Multiple lives in a single life. It takes a lot of work. And butterflies only live a few weeks. But this strategy is not as rare as you might
think. In the animal kingdom, it’s incredibly common. Mammals like us are the weird ones. After all, our face doesn't fall off when
we grow up. Hey! It’s Lauren. Can you spot the chrysalises hanging on this
branch? They need that camouflage. Otherwise they’d be sitting ducks for predators. Are you looking for something new? Try Above the Noise, a new series from KQED
and PBS Digital Studios that cuts through the hype of today’s headlines, with science. See you next time!

**Transcript**:
Is teleportation possible? Could a baseball transform into
something like a radio wave, travel through buildings, bounce around corners, and change back into a baseball? Oddly enough, thanks to quantum mechanics,
the answer might actually be yes. Sort of. Here's the trick. The baseball itself couldn't 
be sent by radio, but all the information about it could. In quantum physics, atoms and electrons are interpreted as a collection
of distinct properties, for example, position, momentum, and intrinsic spin. The values of these properties 
configure the particle, giving it a quantum state identity. If two electrons have 
the same quantum state, they're identical. In a literal sense, our baseball
is defined by a collective quantum state resulting from its many atoms. If this quantum state information
could be read in Boston and sent around the world, atoms for the same chemical elements
could have this information imprinted on them in Bangalore and be carefully directed to assemble, becoming the exact same baseball. There's a wrinkle though. Quantum states aren't so easy to measure. The uncertainty principle 
in quantum physics implies the position and momentum
of a particle can't be measured at the same time. The simplest way to measure
the exact position of an electron requires scattering a particle of light,
a photon, from it, and collecting the light in a microscope. But that scattering changes the momentum
of the electron in an unpredictable way. We lose all previous information
about momentum. In a sense, 
quantum information is fragile. Measuring the information changes it. So how can we transmit something we're not permitted to fully read
without destroying it? The answer can be found in the strange
phenomena of quantum entanglement. Entanglement is an old mystery
from the early days of quantum physics and it's still not entirely understood. Entangling the spin of two electrons
results in an influence that transcends distance. Measuring the spin of the first electron determines what spin will 
measure for the second, whether the two particles are a mile
or a light year apart. Somehow, information 
about the first electron's quantum state, called a qubit of data, influences its partner without 
transmission across the intervening space. Einstein and his colleagues called
this strange communcation spooky action at a distance. While it does seem that entanglement
between two particles helps transfer a qubit instantaneously
across the space between them, there's a catch. This interaction must begin locally. The two electrons must be entangled
in close proximity before one of them is transported
to a new site. By itself, quantum entanglement
isn't teleportation. To complete the teleport, we need a digital message to help
interpret the qubit at the receiving end. Two bits of data created by measuring
the first particle. These digital bits must be transmitted
by a classical channel that's limited by the speed of light,
radio, microwaves, or perhaps fiberoptics. When we measure a particle
for this digital message, we destroy its quantum information, which means the baseball must disappear
from Boston for it to teleport to Bangalore. Thanks to the uncertainty principle, teleportation transfers the information
about the baseball between the two cities
and never duplicates it. So in principle, we could teleport 
objects, even people, but at present, it seems unlikely
we can measure the quantum states of the trillion trillion or more atoms
in large objects and then recreate them elsewhere. The complexity of this task
and the energy needed is astronomical. For now, we can reliably teleport
single electrons and atoms, which may lead to super-secured
data encryption for future quantum computers. The philosophical implications
of quantum teleportation are subtle. A teleported object doesn't exactly
transport across space like tangible matter, nor does it exactly transmit across space,
like intangible information. It seems to do a little of both. Quantum physics gives us 
a strange new vision for all the matter in our universe
as collections of fragile information. And quantum teleportation reveals
new ways to influence this fragility. And remember, never say never. In a little over a century, mankind has advanced from an uncertain 
new understanding of the behavior of electrons
at the atomic scale to reliably teleporting them
across a room. What new technical mastery 
of such phenomena might we have in 1,000, 
or even 10,000 years? Only time and space will tell.

**Transcript**:
Is teleportation possible? Could a baseball transform into
something like a radio wave, travel through buildings, bounce around corners, and change back into a baseball? Oddly enough, thanks to quantum mechanics,
the answer might actually be yes. Sort of. Here's the trick. The baseball itself couldn't 
be sent by radio, but all the information about it could. In quantum physics, atoms and electrons are interpreted as a collection
of distinct properties, for example, position, momentum, and intrinsic spin. The values of these properties 
configure the particle, giving it a quantum state identity. If two electrons have 
the same quantum state, they're identical. In a literal sense, our baseball
is defined by a collective quantum state resulting from its many atoms. If this quantum state information
could be read in Boston and sent around the world, atoms for the same chemical elements
could have this information imprinted on them in Bangalore and be carefully directed to assemble, becoming the exact same baseball. There's a wrinkle though. Quantum states aren't so easy to measure. The uncertainty principle 
in quantum physics implies the position and momentum
of a particle can't be measured at the same time. The simplest way to measure
the exact position of an electron requires scattering a particle of light,
a photon, from it, and collecting the light in a microscope. But that scattering changes the momentum
of the electron in an unpredictable way. We lose all previous information
about momentum. In a sense, 
quantum information is fragile. Measuring the information changes it. So how can we transmit something we're not permitted to fully read
without destroying it? The answer can be found in the strange
phenomena of quantum entanglement. Entanglement is an old mystery
from the early days of quantum physics and it's still not entirely understood. Entangling the spin of two electrons
results in an influence that transcends distance. Measuring the spin of the first electron determines what spin will 
measure for the second, whether the two particles are a mile
or a light year apart. Somehow, information 
about the first electron's quantum state, called a qubit of data, influences its partner without 
transmission across the intervening space. Einstein and his colleagues called
this strange communcation spooky action at a distance. While it does seem that entanglement
between two particles helps transfer a qubit instantaneously
across the space between them, there's a catch. This interaction must begin locally. The two electrons must be entangled
in close proximity before one of them is transported
to a new site. By itself, quantum entanglement
isn't teleportation. To complete the teleport, we need a digital message to help
interpret the qubit at the receiving end. Two bits of data created by measuring
the first particle. These digital bits must be transmitted
by a classical channel that's limited by the speed of light,
radio, microwaves, or perhaps fiberoptics. When we measure a particle
for this digital message, we destroy its quantum information, which means the baseball must disappear
from Boston for it to teleport to Bangalore. Thanks to the uncertainty principle, teleportation transfers the information
about the baseball between the two cities
and never duplicates it. So in principle, we could teleport 
objects, even people, but at present, it seems unlikely
we can measure the quantum states of the trillion trillion or more atoms
in large objects and then recreate them elsewhere. The complexity of this task
and the energy needed is astronomical. For now, we can reliably teleport
single electrons and atoms, which may lead to super-secured
data encryption for future quantum computers. The philosophical implications
of quantum teleportation are subtle. A teleported object doesn't exactly
transport across space like tangible matter, nor does it exactly transmit across space,
like intangible information. It seems to do a little of both. Quantum physics gives us 
a strange new vision for all the matter in our universe
as collections of fragile information. And quantum teleportation reveals
new ways to influence this fragility. And remember, never say never. In a little over a century, mankind has advanced from an uncertain 
new understanding of the behavior of electrons
at the atomic scale to reliably teleporting them
across a room. What new technical mastery 
of such phenomena might we have in 1,000, 
or even 10,000 years? Only time and space will tell.

These are the first five elements
of a number sequence. Can you figure out what comes next? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 There is a pattern here, but it may not be the kind
of pattern you think it is. Look at the sequence again
and try reading it aloud. Now, look at the next number
in the sequence. 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1. Pause again if you'd like to think
about it some more. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This is what's known as
a look and say sequence. Unlike many number sequences, this relies not on some mathematical
property of the numbers themselves, but on their notation. Start with the left-most digit
of the initial number. Now, read out how many times 
it repeats in succession followed by the name of the digit itself. Then move on to the next distinct digit
and repeat until you reach the end. So the number 1 is read as "one one" written down the same way 
we write eleven. Of course, as part of this sequence,
it's not actually the number eleven, but 2 ones, which we then write as 2 1. That number is then read out
as 1 2 1 1, which written out we'd read as
one one, one two, two ones, and so on. These kinds of sequences were first
analyzed by mathematician John Conway, who noted they have 
some interesting properties. For instance, starting with the number 22,
yields an infinite loop of two twos. But when seeded with any other number, the sequence grows in some
very specific ways. Notice that although the number
of digits keeps increasing, the increase doesn't seem
to be either linear or random. In fact, if you extend the sequence
infinitely, a pattern emerges. The ratio between the amount of digits
in two consecutive terms gradually converges to a single number
known as Conway's Constant. This is equal to a little over 1.3, meaning that the amount of digits
increases by about 30% with every step in the sequence. What about the numbers themselves? That gets even more interesting. Except for the repeating sequence of 22, every possible sequence eventually breaks
down into distinct strings of digits. No matter what order these strings
show up in, each appears unbroken in its entirety
every time it occurs. Conway identified 92 of these elements, all composed only of digits 1, 2, and 3, as well as two additional elements whose variations
can end with any digit of 4 or greater. No matter what number the sequence
is seeded with, eventually, it'll just consist
of these combinations, with digits 4 or higher only appearing
at the end of the two extra elements, if at all. Beyond being a neat puzzle, the look and say sequence
has some practical applications. For example, run-length encoding, a data compression that was once used for
television signals and digital graphics, is based on a similar concept. The amount of times a data value repeats
within the code is recorded as a data value itself. Sequences like this are a good example
of how numbers and other symbols can convey meaning on multiple levels.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 9, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 8
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Deep underground lies stores of once
inaccessible natural gas. This gas was likely formed 
over millions of years as layers of decaying organisms
were exposed to intense heat and pressure under the Earth's crust. There's a technology called
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that can extract this natural gas, potentially powering us
for decades to come. So how does fracking work, and why it is a source 
of such heated controversy? A fracking site can be anywhere
with natural gas, from a remote desert to several hundred feet
from your backyard. It starts out with a long vertical hole
known as a wellbore drilled down through layers of sediment. When the well reaches 2500 - 3000 meters,
it's at its kickoff point where it can begin the process
of horizontal drilling. It turns 90 degrees and extends
horizontally for about 1.5 kilometers through a compressed black layer
called the shale rock formation. A specialized perforating gun
is then lowered and fired, creating a series of small, 
inch-long holes that burst through the well's casing
into the rock layer. About three to four months
after the initial drilling, the well is ready for fracking to begin. Fracking fluid is pumped down
into the well at a pressure so high, it cracks the shale rock, creating fractures through which
the trapped gas and oil can escape. The fluid itself is more than 90% water. The rest is made up of concentrated
chemical additives. These vary depending on the specific
characteristics of the fracking site, but usually fall into three categories: acids for clearing debris
and dissolving minerals, friction-reducing compounds to create a slippery form of water 
known as slickwater, and disinfectant to prevent
bacteria growth. Sand or clay is also mixed into
the water to prop open the fissures so the gas and oil can keep leaking out,
even after the pressure is released. It's estimated that all of fracking's
intense pumping and flushing uses an average of 3-6 million gallons
of water per well. That's actually not a lot compared
to agriculture, power plants, or even golf course maintenance, but it can have a notable impact
on local water supply. And disposing of used fracking water
is also an issue. Along with the trapped gas
that's pumped up to the surface, millions of gallons of flow-back liquid
come gushing up. This liquid containing contaminants
like radioactive material, salts, heavy metals, and hydrocarbons, needs to be stored and disposed of. That's usually done in pits on-site
in deep wells or off-site at water treatment facilities. Another option is to recycle
the flow-back liquid, but the recycling process can actually
increase levels of contamination since the water is more toxic
with each use. Wells are typically encased 
in steel and cement to prevent contaminants from leaking
into groundwater. But any negligence 
or fracking-related accidents can have devastating effects. Fracturing directly 
into underground water hazardous underground 
seepage and leakage, and inadequate treatment and disposal
of highly-toxic waste water can potentially contaminate
drinking water around a fracking site. There's also concern about
the threat of earthquakes and damaged infrastructure from pressure 
and waste water injection. Links between fracking
and increased seismic activity leave unresolved questions
about long-term pressure imbalances that might be happening
deep beneath our feet. Fracking's biggest controversy, though,
is happening above the ground. The general consensus is that burning
natural gas is better for the environment than burning coal since the gas collected from fracking emits only half 
the carbon dioxide as coal per unit of energy. The pollution caused 
by the fracking itself, though, isn't negligible. Methane that leaks out during the drilling
and pumping process is many times more potent
than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. Some scientists argue that methane
eventually dissipates, so has a relatively low long-term impact. But a greater question hangs in the air. Does fracking take time,
money, and research away from the development
of cleaner renewable energy sources? Natural gas is non-renewable, and the short-run economic interests
supporting fracking may fall short in the face
of global climate change. Experts are still examining
fracking's overarching effects. Although modern fracking has been
around since the 1940s, it's boomed in the last few decades. As other sources of natural gas decrease,
the costs of non-renewable energies rise, and cutting-edge technologies
make it so accessible. But many countries and regions
have already banned fracking in response to environmental concerns. It's undeniable that fracking has reshaped
the energy landscape around the world, but for what long-term benefit
and at what cost?

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Deep underground lies stores of once
inaccessible natural gas. This gas was likely formed 
over millions of years as layers of decaying organisms
were exposed to intense heat and pressure under the Earth's crust. There's a technology called
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that can extract this natural gas, potentially powering us
for decades to come. So how does fracking work, and why it is a source 
of such heated controversy? A fracking site can be anywhere
with natural gas, from a remote desert to several hundred feet
from your backyard. It starts out with a long vertical hole
known as a wellbore drilled down through layers of sediment. When the well reaches 2500 - 3000 meters,
it's at its kickoff point where it can begin the process
of horizontal drilling. It turns 90 degrees and extends
horizontally for about 1.5 kilometers through a compressed black layer
called the shale rock formation. A specialized perforating gun
is then lowered and fired, creating a series of small, 
inch-long holes that burst through the well's casing
into the rock layer. About three to four months
after the initial drilling, the well is ready for fracking to begin. Fracking fluid is pumped down
into the well at a pressure so high, it cracks the shale rock, creating fractures through which
the trapped gas and oil can escape. The fluid itself is more than 90% water. The rest is made up of concentrated
chemical additives. These vary depending on the specific
characteristics of the fracking site, but usually fall into three categories: acids for clearing debris
and dissolving minerals, friction-reducing compounds to create a slippery form of water 
known as slickwater, and disinfectant to prevent
bacteria growth. Sand or clay is also mixed into
the water to prop open the fissures so the gas and oil can keep leaking out,
even after the pressure is released. It's estimated that all of fracking's
intense pumping and flushing uses an average of 3-6 million gallons
of water per well. That's actually not a lot compared
to agriculture, power plants, or even golf course maintenance, but it can have a notable impact
on local water supply. And disposing of used fracking water
is also an issue. Along with the trapped gas
that's pumped up to the surface, millions of gallons of flow-back liquid
come gushing up. This liquid containing contaminants
like radioactive material, salts, heavy metals, and hydrocarbons, needs to be stored and disposed of. That's usually done in pits on-site
in deep wells or off-site at water treatment facilities. Another option is to recycle
the flow-back liquid, but the recycling process can actually
increase levels of contamination since the water is more toxic
with each use. Wells are typically encased 
in steel and cement to prevent contaminants from leaking
into groundwater. But any negligence 
or fracking-related accidents can have devastating effects. Fracturing directly 
into underground water hazardous underground 
seepage and leakage, and inadequate treatment and disposal
of highly-toxic waste water can potentially contaminate
drinking water around a fracking site. There's also concern about
the threat of earthquakes and damaged infrastructure from pressure 
and waste water injection. Links between fracking
and increased seismic activity leave unresolved questions
about long-term pressure imbalances that might be happening
deep beneath our feet. Fracking's biggest controversy, though,
is happening above the ground. The general consensus is that burning
natural gas is better for the environment than burning coal since the gas collected from fracking emits only half 
the carbon dioxide as coal per unit of energy. The pollution caused 
by the fracking itself, though, isn't negligible. Methane that leaks out during the drilling
and pumping process is many times more potent
than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. Some scientists argue that methane
eventually dissipates, so has a relatively low long-term impact. But a greater question hangs in the air. Does fracking take time,
money, and research away from the development
of cleaner renewable energy sources? Natural gas is non-renewable, and the short-run economic interests
supporting fracking may fall short in the face
of global climate change. Experts are still examining
fracking's overarching effects. Although modern fracking has been
around since the 1940s, it's boomed in the last few decades. As other sources of natural gas decrease,
the costs of non-renewable energies rise, and cutting-edge technologies
make it so accessible. But many countries and regions
have already banned fracking in response to environmental concerns. It's undeniable that fracking has reshaped
the energy landscape around the world, but for what long-term benefit
and at what cost?

**Transcript**:
Cats are obsessed with staying clean. They can spend up to half their waking hours
grooming. Their tongue is covered in tiny spines. They’re what makes the tongue feel so sandpapery. These spines, called papillae, are made of
keratin, just like their claws and our fingernails. The papillae even look like miniature cat
claws. They do an impeccable job of detangling their
fur. Researchers at Georgia Tech made a 3D model
of a cat’s tongue… to test how it works. See how the fur just peels off? It’s because the spines are all angled in
the same direction. With a typical hairbrush, you’d have to
pick the fur out from between the bristles. So why are cats so preoccupied with grooming? For them, it’s about more than just vanity. For one thing, it’s a way to show affection--
to build bonds. That’s why they appreciate us petting them. And it spreads out oils produced by the cat’s
skin that gives their fur some water resistance. But when it really comes down to it, for cats,
staying clean is a matter of life and death. Cats are carnivores… ambush predators. They hide and sneak up on their unsuspecting
prey. One whiff of the wrong odor could give the
cat away. But when they pounce, it’s their bite that
finishes the job. Cats have extra-wide mouths so they can get
their teeth around their prey’s neck. It would be like having the corners of your
mouth go all the way back by your ears. But there’s a tradeoff that comes with that
big bite. Those wide mouths mean their lips can’t
come together to form a good seal. They can’t create suction to drink the way
we do. So, they flick the water with the tip of their
tongue Researchers at MIT made a model using a glass
disc, to show how cats get a drink by just barely touching the water’s surface. The water sticks to the disc and to itself. Lift the disc at the right speed and it pulls
the water up into a column. Then, the cat bites it at precisely the right
moment to get as much water as possible. And all of this happens four times per second! It’s a complicated way to take a drink,
but it’s just one of prices cats pay to be the expert predators they are… Hey guys, It’s Lauren. You know you love fuzzy critters. So check out our other episodes like this
one. See what you can learn about a squirrel's
mood just by looking at its tail. Or how the fuzziness of owl feathers makes
them such stealthy hunters. And if you like the show, share us! Thanks for watching.

**Transcript**:
Cats are obsessed with staying clean. They can spend up to half their waking hours
grooming. Their tongue is covered in tiny spines. They’re what makes the tongue feel so sandpapery. These spines, called papillae, are made of
keratin, just like their claws and our fingernails. The papillae even look like miniature cat
claws. They do an impeccable job of detangling their
fur. Researchers at Georgia Tech made a 3D model
of a cat’s tongue… to test how it works. See how the fur just peels off? It’s because the spines are all angled in
the same direction. With a typical hairbrush, you’d have to
pick the fur out from between the bristles. So why are cats so preoccupied with grooming? For them, it’s about more than just vanity. For one thing, it’s a way to show affection--
to build bonds. That’s why they appreciate us petting them. And it spreads out oils produced by the cat’s
skin that gives their fur some water resistance. But when it really comes down to it, for cats,
staying clean is a matter of life and death. Cats are carnivores… ambush predators. They hide and sneak up on their unsuspecting
prey. One whiff of the wrong odor could give the
cat away. But when they pounce, it’s their bite that
finishes the job. Cats have extra-wide mouths so they can get
their teeth around their prey’s neck. It would be like having the corners of your
mouth go all the way back by your ears. But there’s a tradeoff that comes with that
big bite. Those wide mouths mean their lips can’t
come together to form a good seal. They can’t create suction to drink the way
we do. So, they flick the water with the tip of their
tongue Researchers at MIT made a model using a glass
disc, to show how cats get a drink by just barely touching the water’s surface. The water sticks to the disc and to itself. Lift the disc at the right speed and it pulls
the water up into a column. Then, the cat bites it at precisely the right
moment to get as much water as possible. And all of this happens four times per second! It’s a complicated way to take a drink,
but it’s just one of prices cats pay to be the expert predators they are… Hey guys, It’s Lauren. You know you love fuzzy critters. So check out our other episodes like this

**Transcript**:
Most people will take a pill, receive an injection, or otherwise take some kind of medicine
during their lives, but most of us don't know anything
about how these substances actually work. How can various compounds impact the way
we physically feel, think, and even behave? For the most part, this depends on
how a drug alters the communication between cells in the brain. There are a number of different ways
that can happen. But before it gets into the brain, any drug must first reach the bloodstream on a journey that can take anywhere
from seconds to hours, depending on factors like how
it's administered. The slowest method is to take
a drug orally because it must be absorbed by
our digestive system before it takes effect. Inhaling a drug gets it into
the bloodstream faster. And injecting a drug intravenously
works quickly too because it pumps the chemicals directly
into the blood. Once there, the drug quickly reaches
the gates of its destination, the brain. The entrance to this organ is guarded
by the blood-brain barrier, which separates blood 
from the nervous system to keep potentially dangerous 
substances out. So all drugs must have a specific
chemical composition which gives them the key to unlock
this barrier and pass through. Once inside, drugs start to interfere
with the brain's normal functioning by targeting its web of neurons 
and synapses. Neurons are brain cells that have
a nucleus, dendrites, and an axon. Synapses are structures placed along
the dendrites or the axon which allow the exchange of 
electrochemical signals between neurons. Those signals take the form of chemicals
called neurotransmitters. Each neurotransmitter plays different
roles in regulating our behaviors, emotions, and cognition. But they all work in one of two ways. They can either inhibit 
the receiving neuron, limiting its activity, or excite it, creating a new electrochemical signal
that spreads throughout the network. Any leftover neurotransmitter usually
gets degraded or reabsorbed 
into the transmitting neuron. A drug's effectiveness stems 
from its ability to manipulate these synaptic transmissions
at different phases of the process. That results in an increase or a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitters
being spread. For instance, common antidepressants,
like SSRIs, stop the reabsorption of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that modulates
our moods. This effectively pushes more of it
into the neural network. Meanwhile, painkillers, like morphine, raise levels of serotonin 
and noradrenaline, which regulate energy, arousal, alertness, and pleasure. Those same neurotransmitters also
affect endorphin receptors, reducing pain perception. And tranquilizers works by increasing
the production of GABA to inhibit neural activity putting the person in a relaxed
or sedated state. What about illegal or elicit drugs? These have powerful impacts on the brain
that we're still trying to understand. Crystal meth, an amphetamine, induces a long-lasting release
of dopamine, a neurotransmitter linked with
the perception of reward and pleasure. It also activates noradrenaline receptors, which increases the heart rate, dilates pupils, and triggers the body's fight
or flight response. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine
and serotonin, pushing more into the network where they boost energy, create feelings of euphoria, and suppress appetites. And hallucinogenic drugs have some
of the most puzzling effects. Substances like LSD, mescaline, and DMT all block the release of serotonin, which regulates mood and impulsivity. They also have an impact 
on the neural circuits involved in perception, learning,
and behavioral regulation, which may explain why these drugs
have such powerful impacts. Even if some of these 
effects sound exciting, there are reasons why some of these drugs
are highly controlled and often illegal. Drugs have the power to alter 
the brain's chemistry, and repeated use can permanently
rewire the neural networks that support our ability to think, make decisions, learn, and remember things. There's a lot we still don't know 
about drugs and their effects, both the good and the bad. But those we do know about are the ones
we've studied closely, and turned into effective medicines. As our knowledge grows about drugs
and the brain, the possibilities will also increase for treating the many medical problems
that puzzle researchers today.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Most people will take a pill, receive an injection, or otherwise take some kind of medicine
during their lives, but most of us don't know anything
about how these substances actually work. How can various compounds impact the way
we physically feel, think, and even behave? For the most part, this depends on
how a drug alters the communication between cells in the brain. There are a number of different ways
that can happen. But before it gets into the brain, any drug must first reach the bloodstream on a journey that can take anywhere
from seconds to hours, depending on factors like how
it's administered. The slowest method is to take
a drug orally because it must be absorbed by
our digestive system before it takes effect. Inhaling a drug gets it into
the bloodstream faster. And injecting a drug intravenously
works quickly too because it pumps the chemicals directly
into the blood. Once there, the drug quickly reaches
the gates of its destination, the brain. The entrance to this organ is guarded
by the blood-brain barrier, which separates blood 
from the nervous system to keep potentially dangerous 
substances out. So all drugs must have a specific
chemical composition which gives them the key to unlock
this barrier and pass through. Once inside, drugs start to interfere
with the brain's normal functioning by targeting its web of neurons 
and synapses. Neurons are brain cells that have
a nucleus, dendrites, and an axon. Synapses are structures placed along
the dendrites or the axon which allow the exchange of 
electrochemical signals between neurons. Those signals take the form of chemicals
called neurotransmitters. Each neurotransmitter plays different
roles in regulating our behaviors, emotions, and cognition. But they all work in one of two ways. They can either inhibit 
the receiving neuron, limiting its activity, or excite it, creating a new electrochemical signal
that spreads throughout the network. Any leftover neurotransmitter usually
gets degraded or reabsorbed 
into the transmitting neuron. A drug's effectiveness stems 
from its ability to manipulate these synaptic transmissions
at different phases of the process. That results in an increase or a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitters
being spread. For instance, common antidepressants,
like SSRIs, stop the reabsorption of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that modulates
our moods. This effectively pushes more of it
into the neural network. Meanwhile, painkillers, like morphine, raise levels of serotonin 
and noradrenaline, which regulate energy, arousal, alertness, and pleasure. Those same neurotransmitters also
affect endorphin receptors, reducing pain perception. And tranquilizers works by increasing
the production of GABA to inhibit neural activity putting the person in a relaxed
or sedated state. What about illegal or elicit drugs? These have powerful impacts on the brain
that we're still trying to understand. Crystal meth, an amphetamine, induces a long-lasting release
of dopamine, a neurotransmitter linked with
the perception of reward and pleasure. It also activates noradrenaline receptors, which increases the heart rate, dilates pupils, and triggers the body's fight
or flight response. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine
and serotonin, pushing more into the network where they boost energy, create feelings of euphoria, and suppress appetites. And hallucinogenic drugs have some
of the most puzzling effects. Substances like LSD, mescaline, and DMT all block the release of serotonin, which regulates mood and impulsivity. They also have an impact 
on the neural circuits involved in perception, learning,
and behavioral regulation, which may explain why these drugs
have such powerful impacts. Even if some of these 
effects sound exciting, there are reasons why some of these drugs
are highly controlled and often illegal. Drugs have the power to alter 
the brain's chemistry, and repeated use can permanently
rewire the neural networks that support our ability to think, make decisions, learn, and remember things. There's a lot we still don't know 
about drugs and their effects, both the good and the bad. But those we do know about are the ones
we've studied closely, and turned into effective medicines. As our knowledge grows about drugs
and the brain, the possibilities will also increase for treating the many medical problems
that puzzle researchers today.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You are the cargo director on the maiden
voyage of the S.S. Buoyant, and you've agreed to transport
several tanks containing the last specimens of a critically
endangered fish species to their new aquarium. Unfortunately, as you're passing
through shark-infested waters, the boat is battered by a fierce storm,
throwing your precious cargo overboard. And to make matters worse, no one seems certain
just how many fish tanks are missing. Fortunately, you have a rescue sub
at your disposal, but only enough fuel for one trip
to the ocean floor. You need to know where the tanks are so you can gather them all
in one quick pass. Not a single fish can be lost. You decide to scan the three sectors
of the ocean floor where the cargo could have landed. Thermal imaging shows 50 organisms
in the area, and you quickly realize that that number
includes both your fish and some ravenous sharks. You flip on the sonar 
to get a better look. The image for Sector Alpha shows
four tanks and two sharks, the image for Sector Beta shows
two tanks and four sharks, and the image for Sector Gamma
is blank. Your sonar has malfunctioned, and you're going to have to go
with the info you have. You check the shipping notes, but all you learn is that each tank
had the same number of fish inside. The cargo hold had space for anywhere
from 1 to 13 total tanks. And finally, the old captain tells you
that this area has the odd property that no two sectors can have the same
number of sharks, but every sector will have at least one, and no more than seven. There's no time to waste. The tanks won't withstand the pressure
much longer. As you descend in the sub,
you review everything you know. How many fish tanks do you need
to find in Sector Gamma? Hurry, the fate of an entire species
depends on you. Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 At first, it seems like there are just
too many missing pieces of information. After all, you don't know how many fish
or how many tanks there are, let alone how many fish are in each one. But then you remember the best way to compare multiple pieces 
of partial information - a table. Since we know there are thirteen
tanks at most, and we already see six tanks
in Sectors Alpha and Beta, we know the total number of tanks
must be between 6 and 13. We also know that each sector has 
a different amount of sharks with no more than seven in each one. Since there are two in Sector Alpha
and four in Sector Beta, Sector Gamma can have 
1, 3, 5, 6, or 7 sharks. What about the number of endangered fish? Out of the 50 total organisms
in all three sectors, we know at least seven are sharks, leaving a maximum of 43 fish
inside all the tanks. And the more sharks we find in Sector 3,
the fewer fish there are to save. Now, remember that the fish are
equally distributed across all the tanks. Why is that important? Because it means that one of the possible
values for the total amount of fish must be divisible by one of the possible
values for the total amount of tanks. And looking at the table, we can see
that the only combination that works is 39 fish divided between 13 tanks
with three fish in each. With sharks swarming around, you quickly pilot the sub through
the first two sectors before retrieving the remaining
seven tanks in Sector Gamma. You've saved the species
and taken an impromptu dive. All in all, not a bad day,
unless you happen to be a hungry shark.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

from 1 to 13 total tanks. And finally, the old captain tells you
that this area has the odd property that no two sectors can have the same
number of sharks, but every sector will have at least one, and no more than seven. There's no time to waste. The tanks won't withstand the pressure
much longer. As you descend in the sub,
you review everything you know. How many fish tanks do you need
to find in Sector Gamma? Hurry, the fate of an entire species
depends on you. Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 At first, it seems like there are just
too many missing pieces of information. After all, you don't know how many fish
or how many tanks there are, let alone how many fish are in each one. But then you remember the best way to compare multiple pieces 
of partial information - a table. Since we know there are thirteen
tanks at most, and we already see six tanks
in Sectors Alpha and Beta, we know the total number of tanks
must be between 6 and 13. We also know that each sector has 
a different amount of sharks with no more than seven in each one. Since there are two in Sector Alpha
and four in Sector Beta, Sector Gamma can have 
1, 3, 5, 6, or 7 sharks. What about the number of endangered fish? Out of the 50 total organisms
in all three sectors, we know at least seven are sharks, leaving a maximum of 43 fish
inside all the tanks. And the more sharks we find in Sector 3,
the fewer fish there are to save. Now, remember that the fish are
equally distributed across all the tanks. Why is that important? Because it means that one of the possible
values for the total amount of fish must be divisible by one of the possible
values for the total amount of tanks. And looking at the table, we can see
that the only combination that works is 39 fish divided between 13 tanks
with three fish in each. With sharks swarming around, you quickly pilot the sub through
the first two sectors before retrieving the remaining
seven tanks in Sector Gamma. You've saved the species
and taken an impromptu dive. All in all, not a bad day,
unless you happen to be a hungry shark.

**Transcript**:
Lead is a sneaky little element. It’s malleable and durable, so it’s no
wonder that for years we used it in piping and added it to paint. But it’s also extremely poisonous. It can create problems all over the body—from
rashes, to abdominal pain, to anemia. But the most serious effects occur in the
brain—and especially in the brains of children. It can cause headaches, memory loss, learning
disabilities, behavioral issues, and seizures. And kids don’t even have to be exposed directly. Women who wind up ingesting lead can store
it in their bones. And if they get pregnant, that lead can be
passed on and damage the brains of their children. Lead poisoning is still a big problem in the
US today—and not just in communities you may have heard of, like Flint, Michigan. So, what’s actually happening to the brain
when you have lead poisoning? And is there anything we can do to stop it? I’m Anna and this is Gross Science. Lead messes with our brains in a few different
ways. But to understand what they are, let’s look
really quickly at how brain cells—or neurons—communicate: and I promise, this will be short, sweet,
and hopefully deeply enlightening. Ok, so neurons have a long tail called an
“axon” at one end, and branch-like structures called “dendrites” at the other. They talk to one another when the axon from
one cell sends chemical signals to another cell’s dendrites. The receiving cell can then pass the message
on to yet another neuron. And all that communicating happens in this
tiny gap between the cells called the “synapse.” One thing lead can do is block those chemical
signals from being sent, which sounds bad enough. But, lead does another thing that can have
even more long-term effects. It can make the synapse—that connection
between your neurons—become weaker over time. You see, in order for neurons to maintain
a strong connection, the axon needs to know that the dendrite is receiving its messages. So the dendrite produces a molecule that lets
the axon know it’s being heard loud and clear. That molecule is called BDNF, and you can
kind of think of it like the best-friends molecule. It makes the axon and dendrite’s relationship
even stronger. But, in order for the cell to produce BDNF,
it needs calcium. Calcium usually enters the dendrite through
channels, which act like a door that opens for a little while when a signal is received. When the door’s unlocked by the right set
of molecules, calcium flows through freely. But when lead’s present, it jams the door,
preventing calcium from entering and keeping BDNF from being made. That means that the connections between brain
cells start to wither. In adults, having poor connections between
your neurons is harmful enough. But in children, with their fast growing brains,
it’s especially dangerous—not to mention that the amount of lead needed to cause brain
damage in kids is much smaller, in part because their brains are making (and removing) new
connections at much faster rates. Sadly, in the past there haven’t been great
treatments for lead poisoning—and especially not for its effects on the brain. But recently, scientists have shown that simply
by adding a BDNF substitute, neurons may be able to bounce back. Here’s a video showing this process in action. On the left are normal cells, in the middle
are cells exposed to lead, and on the right are cells exposed to lead that have been given
BDNF. When the green dye disappears, it means that
the neurons are able to send their chemical signals—so when the video turns black you
know everything’s working properly. You can see that the green starts to disappear
in the cells with additional BDNF, even though they’ve been exposed to lead. Now, we’re still far from using BDNF as
a cure for lead poisoning—this isn’t even being tested on humans yet. Certainly, preventing the exposure to lead
in the first place should be the primary goal. But this research offers hope that one day,
lead poisoning may be much more treatable. And that’s a great thing, since today, at
least 4 million American households with kids are exposed to high levels of lead. And that’s gross. Ew.

**Transcript**:
Lead is a sneaky little element. It’s malleable and durable, so it’s no
wonder that for years we used it in piping and added it to paint. But it’s also extremely poisonous. It can create problems all over the body—from
rashes, to abdominal pain, to anemia. But the most serious effects occur in the
brain—and especially in the brains of children. It can cause headaches, memory loss, learning
disabilities, behavioral issues, and seizures. And kids don’t even have to be exposed directly. Women who wind up ingesting lead can store
it in their bones. And if they get pregnant, that lead can be
passed on and damage the brains of their children. Lead poisoning is still a big problem in the
US today—and not just in communities you may have heard of, like Flint, Michigan. So, what’s actually happening to the brain
when you have lead poisoning? And is there anything we can do to stop it? I’m Anna and this is Gross Science. Lead messes with our brains in a few different
ways. But to understand what they are, let’s look
really quickly at how brain cells—or neurons—communicate: and I promise, this will be short, sweet,
and hopefully deeply enlightening. Ok, so neurons have a long tail called an
“axon” at one end, and branch-like structures called “dendrites” at the other. They talk to one another when the axon from
one cell sends chemical signals to another cell’s dendrites. The receiving cell can then pass the message
on to yet another neuron. And all that communicating happens in this
tiny gap between the cells called the “synapse.” One thing lead can do is block those chemical
signals from being sent, which sounds bad enough. But, lead does another thing that can have
even more long-term effects. It can make the synapse—that connection
between your neurons—become weaker over time. You see, in order for neurons to maintain
a strong connection, the axon needs to know that the dendrite is receiving its messages. So the dendrite produces a molecule that lets
the axon know it’s being heard loud and clear. That molecule is called BDNF, and you can
kind of think of it like the best-friends molecule. It makes the axon and dendrite’s relationship
even stronger. But, in order for the cell to produce BDNF,
it needs calcium. Calcium usually enters the dendrite through
channels, which act like a door that opens for a little while when a signal is received. When the door’s unlocked by the right set
of molecules, calcium flows through freely. But when lead’s present, it jams the door,
preventing calcium from entering and keeping BDNF from being made. That means that the connections between brain
cells start to wither. In adults, having poor connections between
your neurons is harmful enough. But in children, with their fast growing brains,
it’s especially dangerous—not to mention that the amount of lead needed to cause brain
damage in kids is much smaller, in part because their brains are making (and removing) new
connections at much faster rates. Sadly, in the past there haven’t been great
treatments for lead poisoning—and especially not for its effects on the brain. But recently, scientists have shown that simply
by adding a BDNF substitute, neurons may be able to bounce back. Here’s a video showing this process in action. On the left are normal cells, in the middle
are cells exposed to lead, and on the right are cells exposed to lead that have been given
BDNF. When the green dye disappears, it means that
the neurons are able to send their chemical signals—so when the video turns black you
know everything’s working properly. You can see that the green starts to disappear
in the cells with additional BDNF, even though they’ve been exposed to lead. Now, we’re still far from using BDNF as
a cure for lead poisoning—this isn’t even being tested on humans yet. Certainly, preventing the exposure to lead
in the first place should be the primary goal. But this research offers hope that one day,
lead poisoning may be much more treatable. And that’s a great thing, since today, at
least 4 million American households with kids are exposed to high levels of lead. And that’s gross. Ew.

**Transcript**:
Stretched across a tree-peppered expanse
in southern Africa lies the magnificent ruins
of Great Zimbabwe, a medieval stone city of astounding
wealth and prestige. Located in the present-day country
of Zimbabwe, it's the sight of the largest known
settlement ruins in Sub-Saharan Africa, second on the continent only
to the pyramids of Egypt. But the history of this city
is shrouded in controversy, defined by decades of dispute
about who built it and why. Its name comes from the Shona word
madzimbabwe, meaning big house of stone for its unscalable stone walls
that reach heights of nearly ten meters and run for a length of about 250 meters. For its grandeur 
and historical significance, it was named a UNESCO 
World Heritage site in 1986. Back in the 14th and 15th centuries,
it was a thriving city. Spread across nearly eight 
square-kilometers, Great Zimbabwe was defined by
three main areas: the Hill Complex, where the king lived; the Great Enclosure, reserved for
members of the royal family; and the Valley Complex, 
where regular citizens lived. Rulers were both powerful economic
and religious leaders for the region. At its highest point, the city had a bustling urban population 
of 18,000 people and was one of the major African 
trade centers at the time. What enabled this growth 
was Great Zimbabwe's influential role in an intercontinental trade network. Connected to several key city-states
along the East African Swahili Coast, it was part of the larger Indian Ocean
trade routes. The city generated its riches 
by controlling the sources and trade of the most prized items: gold, ivory, and copper. With this mercantile power, it was able
to extend its sphere of influence across continents, fostering a strong Arab and Indian
trader presence throughout its zenith. Archaeologists have since pieced together
the details of this history through artifacts discovered on site. There were pottery shards
and glassworks from Asia, as well as coins minted in the coastal
trading city of Kilwa Kisiwani over 1,500 miles away. They also found soapstone bird figures, which are thought to represent
each of the city's rulers, and young calf bones,
only unearthed near the royal residence, show how the diet of the elite
differed from the general population. These clues have also led to theories
about the city's decline. By the mid-15th century, the buildings at Great Zimbabwe
were almost all that remained. Archaeological evidence points
to overcrowding and sanitation issues as the cause, compounded by soil depletion
triggered by overuse. Eventually, as crops withered
and conditions in the city worsened, the population of Great Zimbabwe
is thought to have dispersed and formed the nearby Mutapa
and Torwa states. Centuries later, a new phase
of Great Zimbabwe's influence began to play out in the political realm as people debated who had built
the famous city of stone. During the European 
colonization of Africa, racist colonial officials claimed 
the ruins couldn't be of African origin. So, without a detailed written 
record on hand, they instead relied on myths to explain
the magnificence of Great Zimbabwe. Some claimed it proved the Bible
story of the Queen of Sheba who lived in a city of riches. Others argued it was built by
the Ancient Greeks. Then, in the early 20th century
after extensive excavation at the site, the archaeologist David Randall-MacIver presented clear evidence 
that Great Zimbabwe was built by indigenous peoples. Yet, at the time, the country's white 
minority colonial government sought to discredit this theory because it
challenged the legitimacy of their rule. In fact, the government actively
encouraged historians to produce accounts that disputed
the city's African origins. Over time, however, an overwhelming
body of evidence mounted, identifying Great Zimbabwe as an African
city built by Africans. During the 1960s and 70s, Great Zimbabwe became an important symbol 
for the African Nationalist movement that was spreading across the continent. Today, the ruins at Great Zimbabwe, alluded to on the Zimbabwean flag
by a soapstone bird, still stand as a source of national pride
and cultural value.

**Transcript**:
Stretched across a tree-peppered expanse
in southern Africa lies the magnificent ruins
of Great Zimbabwe, a medieval stone city of astounding
wealth and prestige. Located in the present-day country
of Zimbabwe, it's the sight of the largest known
settlement ruins in Sub-Saharan Africa, second on the continent only
to the pyramids of Egypt. But the history of this city
is shrouded in controversy, defined by decades of dispute
about who built it and why. Its name comes from the Shona word
madzimbabwe, meaning big house of stone for its unscalable stone walls
that reach heights of nearly ten meters and run for a length of about 250 meters. For its grandeur 
and historical significance, it was named a UNESCO 
World Heritage site in 1986. Back in the 14th and 15th centuries,
it was a thriving city. Spread across nearly eight 
square-kilometers, Great Zimbabwe was defined by
three main areas: the Hill Complex, where the king lived; the Great Enclosure, reserved for
members of the royal family; and the Valley Complex, 
where regular citizens lived. Rulers were both powerful economic
and religious leaders for the region. At its highest point, the city had a bustling urban population 
of 18,000 people and was one of the major African 
trade centers at the time. What enabled this growth 
was Great Zimbabwe's influential role in an intercontinental trade network. Connected to several key city-states
along the East African Swahili Coast, it was part of the larger Indian Ocean
trade routes. The city generated its riches 
by controlling the sources and trade of the most prized items: gold, ivory, and copper. With this mercantile power, it was able
to extend its sphere of influence across continents, fostering a strong Arab and Indian
trader presence throughout its zenith. Archaeologists have since pieced together
the details of this history through artifacts discovered on site. There were pottery shards
and glassworks from Asia, as well as coins minted in the coastal
trading city of Kilwa Kisiwani over 1,500 miles away. They also found soapstone bird figures, which are thought to represent
each of the city's rulers, and young calf bones,
only unearthed near the royal residence, show how the diet of the elite
differed from the general population. These clues have also led to theories
about the city's decline. By the mid-15th century, the buildings at Great Zimbabwe
were almost all that remained. Archaeological evidence points
to overcrowding and sanitation issues as the cause, compounded by soil depletion
triggered by overuse. Eventually, as crops withered
and conditions in the city worsened, the population of Great Zimbabwe
is thought to have dispersed and formed the nearby Mutapa
and Torwa states. Centuries later, a new phase
of Great Zimbabwe's influence began to play out in the political realm as people debated who had built
the famous city of stone. During the European 
colonization of Africa, racist colonial officials claimed 
the ruins couldn't be of African origin. So, without a detailed written 
record on hand, they instead relied on myths to explain
the magnificence of Great Zimbabwe. Some claimed it proved the Bible
story of the Queen of Sheba who lived in a city of riches. Others argued it was built by
the Ancient Greeks. Then, in the early 20th century
after extensive excavation at the site, the archaeologist David Randall-MacIver presented clear evidence 
that Great Zimbabwe was built by indigenous peoples. Yet, at the time, the country's white 
minority colonial government sought to discredit this theory because it
challenged the legitimacy of their rule. In fact, the government actively
encouraged historians to produce accounts that disputed
the city's African origins. Over time, however, an overwhelming
body of evidence mounted, identifying Great Zimbabwe as an African
city built by Africans. During the 1960s and 70s, Great Zimbabwe became an important symbol 
for the African Nationalist movement that was spreading across the continent. Today, the ruins at Great Zimbabwe, alluded to on the Zimbabwean flag
by a soapstone bird, still stand as a source of national pride
and cultural value.

**Transcript**:
You've been stranded thousands
of miles from home with no money or possessions. Such a predicament would make many
people despair and curse their awful fate. But for Zeno of Cyprus, it became the
foundation of his life's work and legacy. The once wealthy merchant lost everything
when he was shipwrecked in Athens around 300 BCE. With not much else to do,
he wandered into a book shop, became intrigued by reading about Socrates, and proceeded to seek out and study
with the city's noted philosophers. As Zeno began educating his own students, he originated the philosophy
known as Stoicism, whose teachings of virtue, tolerance,
and self-control have inspired generations of thinkers
and leaders. The name Stoicism comes 
from the Stoa Poikile, the decorated public colonnade where Zeno and his disciples gathered
for discussion. Today, we colloquially 
use the word stoic to mean someone who 
remains calm under pressure and avoids emotional extremes. But while this captures important
aspects of Stoicism, the original philosophy was more
than just an attitude. The Stoics believed that 
everything around us operates according 
to a web of cause and effect, resulting in a rational structure
of the universe, which they called logos. And while we may not always
have control over the events affecting us, we can have control over 
how we approach things. Rather than imagining an ideal society, the Stoic tries to deal 
with the world as it is while pursuing self-improvement
through four cardinal virtues: practical wisdom, the ability to navigate complex situations
in a logical, informed, and calm manner; temperance, the exercise of self-restraint 
and moderation in all aspects of life; justice, treating others with fairness even
when they have done wrong; and courage, not just in extraordinary circumstances, but facing daily challenges
with clarity and integrity. As Seneca, one of the most famous
Roman Stoics wrote, "Sometimes, even to live 
is an act of courage." But while Stoicism focuses on 
personal improvement, it's not a self-centered philosophy. At a time when Roman laws considered
slaves as property, Seneca called for their humane treatment and stressed that we all share
the same fundamental humanity. Nor does Stoicism encourage passivity. The idea is that only people 
who have cultivated virtue and self-control in themselves
can bring positive change in others. One of the most famous Stoic writers
was also one of Rome's greatest emperors. Over the course of his 19-year reign, Stoicism gave Marcus Aurelius the resolve
to lead the Empire through two major wars, while dealing with the loss of many
of his children. Centuries later, Marcus's journals would
guide and comfort Nelson Mandela through his 27-year imprisonment during his struggle 
for racial equality in South Africa. After his release and eventual victory,
Mandela stressed peace and reconciliation, believing that while the injustices
of the past couldn't be changed, his people could confront them
in the present and seek to build a better,
more just future. Stoicism was an active school 
of philosophy for several centuries in Greece and Rome. As a formal institution, it faded away, but its influence has continued
to this day. Christian theologians, 
such as Thomas Aquinas, have admired and adopted its focus
on the virtues, and there are parallels between
Stoic Ataraxia, or tranquility of mind, and the Buddhist concept of Nirvana. One particularly influential Stoic
was the philosopher Epictetus who wrote that suffering stems not from the events in our lives,
but from our judgements about them. This has resonated strongly
with modern psychology and the self-help movement. For example, rational emotive
behavioral therapy focuses on changing 
the self-defeating attitudes people form about 
their life circumstances. There's also Viktor Frankl's logotherapy. Informed by Frankl's own time
as a concentration camp prisoner, logotherapy is based on 
the Stoic principle that we can harness our will power
to fill our lives with meaning, even in the bleakest situations.

**Transcript**:
You've been stranded thousands
of miles from home with no money or possessions. Such a predicament would make many
people despair and curse their awful fate. But for Zeno of Cyprus, it became the
foundation of his life's work and legacy. The once wealthy merchant lost everything
when he was shipwrecked in Athens around 300 BCE. With not much else to do,
he wandered into a book shop, became intrigued by reading about Socrates, and proceeded to seek out and study
with the city's noted philosophers. As Zeno began educating his own students, he originated the philosophy
known as Stoicism, whose teachings of virtue, tolerance,
and self-control have inspired generations of thinkers
and leaders. The name Stoicism comes 
from the Stoa Poikile, the decorated public colonnade where Zeno and his disciples gathered
for discussion. Today, we colloquially 
use the word stoic to mean someone who 
remains calm under pressure and avoids emotional extremes. But while this captures important
aspects of Stoicism, the original philosophy was more
than just an attitude. The Stoics believed that 
everything around us operates according 
to a web of cause and effect, resulting in a rational structure
of the universe, which they called logos. And while we may not always
have control over the events affecting us, we can have control over 
how we approach things. Rather than imagining an ideal society, the Stoic tries to deal 
with the world as it is while pursuing self-improvement
through four cardinal virtues: practical wisdom, the ability to navigate complex situations
in a logical, informed, and calm manner; temperance, the exercise of self-restraint 
and moderation in all aspects of life; justice, treating others with fairness even
when they have done wrong; and courage, not just in extraordinary circumstances, but facing daily challenges
with clarity and integrity. As Seneca, one of the most famous
Roman Stoics wrote, "Sometimes, even to live 
is an act of courage." But while Stoicism focuses on 
personal improvement, it's not a self-centered philosophy. At a time when Roman laws considered
slaves as property, Seneca called for their humane treatment and stressed that we all share
the same fundamental humanity. Nor does Stoicism encourage passivity. The idea is that only people 
who have cultivated virtue and self-control in themselves
can bring positive change in others. One of the most famous Stoic writers
was also one of Rome's greatest emperors. Over the course of his 19-year reign, Stoicism gave Marcus Aurelius the resolve
to lead the Empire through two major wars, while dealing with the loss of many
of his children. Centuries later, Marcus's journals would
guide and comfort Nelson Mandela through his 27-year imprisonment during his struggle 
for racial equality in South Africa. After his release and eventual victory,
Mandela stressed peace and reconciliation, believing that while the injustices
of the past couldn't be changed, his people could confront them
in the present and seek to build a better,
more just future. Stoicism was an active school 
of philosophy for several centuries in Greece and Rome. As a formal institution, it faded away, but its influence has continued
to this day. Christian theologians, 
such as Thomas Aquinas, have admired and adopted its focus
on the virtues, and there are parallels between
Stoic Ataraxia, or tranquility of mind, and the Buddhist concept of Nirvana. One particularly influential Stoic
was the philosopher Epictetus who wrote that suffering stems not from the events in our lives,
but from our judgements about them. This has resonated strongly
with modern psychology and the self-help movement. For example, rational emotive
behavioral therapy focuses on changing 
the self-defeating attitudes people form about 
their life circumstances. There's also Viktor Frankl's logotherapy. Informed by Frankl's own time
as a concentration camp prisoner, logotherapy is based on 
the Stoic principle that we can harness our will power
to fill our lives with meaning, even in the bleakest situations.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Between 2008 and 2012, archeologists excavated the rubble
of an ancient hospital in England. In the process, they uncovered
a number of skeletons. One in particular belonged 
to a wealthy male who lived in the 11th or 12th century and died of leprosy between 
the ages of 18 and 25. How do we know all this? Simply by examining some old,
soil-caked bones? Even centuries after death, skeletons carry unique features
that tell us about their identities. And using modern tools and techniques,
we can read those features as clues. This is a branch of science known as
biological anthropology. It allows researchers to piece together 
details about ancient individuals and identify historical events
that affected whole populations. When researchers uncover a skeleton, some of the first clues they gather,
like age and gender, lie in its morphology, which is the structure, appearance,
and size of a skeleton. Bones, like the clavicle, 
stop growing at age 25, so a skeleton with a clavicle
that hasn't fully formed must be younger than that. Similarly, the plates in the cranium
can continue fusing up to age 40, and sometimes beyond. By combining these with some 
microscopic skeletal clues, physical anthropologists can estimate
an approximate age of death. Meanwhile, pelvic bones reveal gender. Biologically, female pelvises are wider,
allowing women to give birth, where as males are narrower. Bones also betray the signs 
of ancient disease. Disorders like anemia leave their traces
on the bones. And the condition of teeth 
can reveal clues to factors like diet and malnutrition, which sometimes correlate with wealth
or poverty. A protein called collagen can give us
even more profound details. The air we breathe, water we drink, and food we eat leaves permanent traces 
in our bones and teeth in the form of chemical compounds. These compounds contain measurable
quantities called isotopes. Stable isotopes in bone collagen
and tooth enamel varies among mammals dependent on where they lived
and what they ate. So by analyzing these isotopes, we can draw direct inferences regarding 
the diet and location of historic people. Not only that, but during life, bones undergo a constant cycle
of remodeling. So if someone moves from one place
to another, bones synthesized after that move will also reflect the new isotopic 
signatures of the surrounding environment. That means that skeletons can be used
like migratory maps. For instance, between 1-650 AD, the great city of Teotihuacan in Mexico
bustled with thousands of people. Researchers examined the isotope ratios
in skeletons' tooth enamel, which held details of their diets
when they were young. They found evidence for significant
migration into the city. A majority of the individuals
were born elsewhere. With further geological 
and skeletal analysis, they may be able to map where
those people came from. That work in Teotihuacan is also
an example of how bio-anthropologists study skeletons in cemeteries 
and mass graves, then analyze their similarities 
and differences. From that information, they can learn
about cultural beliefs, social norms, wars, and what caused their deaths. Today, we use these tools to answer
big questions about how forces, like migration and disease, shape the modern world. DNA analysis is even possible in some
relatively well-preserved ancient remains. That's helping us understand how diseases
like tuberculosis have evolved over the centuries so we can build better treatments
for people today. Ancient skeletons can tell us a
surprisingly great deal about the past. So if your remains are someday 
buried intact, what might archeologists 
of the distant future learn from them?

**Transcript**:
When Reverend Jim Jones founded
the Peoples Temple in 1955, few could have imagined 
its horrifying end. This progressive religious movement
rose in popularity and gained support from some of San Francisco's 
most prominent politicians. But in 1977, amidst revelations
of brainwashing and abuse, Jones moved with several hundred followers to establish the commune of Jonestown 
in Guyana. Billed as a utopian paradise,
the colony was more like a prison camp, and when a congressional delegation
arrived to investigate its conditions, Jones executed his final plan. On November 18, 1978, 909 men,
women, and children died after being forced to drink 
poisoned Flavor Aid. That grizzly image has since been
immortalized as shorthand slang for single-minded cult-like thinking, "They drank the Kool-aid." Today, there are thousands of cults
around the world. It's important to note two things
about them. First, not all cults are religious. Some are political, therapy-based, focused on self-improvement, or otherwise. And on the flip side, not all new religions are what 
we're referring to as cults. So what exactly defines our modern
understanding of cults, and why do people join them? Broadly speaking, a cult is a group
or movement with a shared commitment to a usually
extreme ideology that's typically embodied
in a charismatic leader. And while few turn out as deadly
as Jonestown or Heaven's Gate, which ended in a mass suicide 
of 39 people in 1997, most cults share some 
basic characteristics. A typical cult requires a high level
of commitment from its members and maintains a strict hierarchy, separating unsuspecting supporters
and recruits from the inner workings. It claims to provide answers
to life's biggest questions through its doctrine, along with the required recipe
for change that shapes a new member
into a true believer. And most importantly, it uses both
formal and informal systems of influence and control
to keep members obedient, with little tolerance for internal 
disagreement or external scrutiny. You might wonder whether 
some of these descriptions might also apply to established religions. In fact, the world "cultus" 
originally described people who cultivated
the worship of certain gods by performing rituals 
and maintaining temples. But in time, it came to mean 
excessive devotion. Many religions began as cults, but integrated into the fabric
of the larger society as they grew. A modern cult, by contrast, separates
its members from others. Rather than providing guidelines
for members to live better lives, a cult seeks to directly control them, from personal and family relationships, to financial assets 
and living arrangements. Cults also demand obedience 
to human leaders who tend to be highly persuasive people with authoritarian 
and narcissistic streaks motivated by money, sex, power,
or all three. While a cult leader uses personal charisma
to attract initial followers, further expansion works 
like a pyramid scheme, with early members recruiting new ones. Cults are skilled at knowing

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
When Reverend Jim Jones founded
the Peoples Temple in 1955, few could have imagined 
its horrifying end. This progressive religious movement
rose in popularity and gained support from some of San Francisco's 
most prominent politicians. But in 1977, amidst revelations
of brainwashing and abuse, Jones moved with several hundred followers to establish the commune of Jonestown 
in Guyana. Billed as a utopian paradise,
the colony was more like a prison camp, and when a congressional delegation
arrived to investigate its conditions, Jones executed his final plan. On November 18, 1978, 909 men,
women, and children died after being forced to drink 
poisoned Flavor Aid. That grizzly image has since been
immortalized as shorthand slang for single-minded cult-like thinking, "They drank the Kool-aid." Today, there are thousands of cults
around the world. It's important to note two things
about them. First, not all cults are religious. Some are political, therapy-based, focused on self-improvement, or otherwise. And on the flip side, not all new religions are what 
we're referring to as cults. So what exactly defines our modern
understanding of cults, and why do people join them? Broadly speaking, a cult is a group
or movement with a shared commitment to a usually
extreme ideology that's typically embodied
in a charismatic leader. And while few turn out as deadly
as Jonestown or Heaven's Gate, which ended in a mass suicide 
of 39 people in 1997, most cults share some 
basic characteristics. A typical cult requires a high level
of commitment from its members and maintains a strict hierarchy, separating unsuspecting supporters
and recruits from the inner workings. It claims to provide answers
to life's biggest questions through its doctrine, along with the required recipe
for change that shapes a new member
into a true believer. And most importantly, it uses both
formal and informal systems of influence and control
to keep members obedient, with little tolerance for internal 
disagreement or external scrutiny. You might wonder whether 
some of these descriptions might also apply to established religions. In fact, the world "cultus" 
originally described people who cultivated
the worship of certain gods by performing rituals 
and maintaining temples. But in time, it came to mean 
excessive devotion. Many religions began as cults, but integrated into the fabric
of the larger society as they grew. A modern cult, by contrast, separates
its members from others. Rather than providing guidelines
for members to live better lives, a cult seeks to directly control them, from personal and family relationships, to financial assets 
and living arrangements. Cults also demand obedience 
to human leaders who tend to be highly persuasive people with authoritarian 
and narcissistic streaks motivated by money, sex, power,
or all three. While a cult leader uses personal charisma
to attract initial followers, further expansion works 
like a pyramid scheme, with early members recruiting new ones. Cults are skilled at knowing 
whom to target, often focusing on those new to an area, or who have recently undergone some
personal or professional loss. Loneliness and a desire for meaning make one susceptible to friendly people
offering community. The recruitment process can be subtle, sometimes taking months
to establish a relationship. In fact, more than two-thirds
of cult members are recruited by a friend, family member, or co-worker whose invitations are harder to refuse. Once in the cult, members are subjected
to multiple forms of indoctrination. Some play on our natural inclination to
mimic social behaviors or follow orders. Other methods may be more intense using techniques of coercive persuasion
involving guilt, shame, and fear. And in many cases, members may
willingly submit out of desire to belong and to attain the promised rewards. The cult environment discourages

in Guyana. Billed as a utopian paradise,
the colony was more like a prison camp, and when a congressional delegation
arrived to investigate its conditions, Jones executed his final plan. On November 18, 1978, 909 men,
women, and children died after being forced to drink 
poisoned Flavor Aid. That grizzly image has since been
immortalized as shorthand slang for single-minded cult-like thinking, "They drank the Kool-aid." Today, there are thousands of cults
around the world. It's important to note two things
about them. First, not all cults are religious. Some are political, therapy-based, focused on self-improvement, or otherwise. And on the flip side, not all new religions are what 
we're referring to as cults. So what exactly defines our modern
understanding of cults, and why do people join them? Broadly speaking, a cult is a group
or movement with a shared commitment to a usually
extreme ideology that's typically embodied
in a charismatic leader. And while few turn out as deadly
as Jonestown or Heaven's Gate, which ended in a mass suicide 
of 39 people in 1997, most cults share some 
basic characteristics. A typical cult requires a high level
of commitment from its members and maintains a strict hierarchy, separating unsuspecting supporters
and recruits from the inner workings. It claims to provide answers
to life's biggest questions through its doctrine, along with the required recipe
for change that shapes a new member
into a true believer. And most importantly, it uses both
formal and informal systems of influence and control
to keep members obedient, with little tolerance for internal 
disagreement or external scrutiny. You might wonder whether 
some of these descriptions might also apply to established religions. In fact, the world "cultus" 
originally described people who cultivated
the worship of certain gods by performing rituals 
and maintaining temples. But in time, it came to mean 
excessive devotion. Many religions began as cults, but integrated into the fabric
of the larger society as they grew. A modern cult, by contrast, separates
its members from others. Rather than providing guidelines
for members to live better lives, a cult seeks to directly control them, from personal and family relationships, to financial assets 
and living arrangements. Cults also demand obedience 
to human leaders who tend to be highly persuasive people with authoritarian 
and narcissistic streaks motivated by money, sex, power,
or all three. While a cult leader uses personal charisma
to attract initial followers, further expansion works 
like a pyramid scheme, with early members recruiting new ones. Cults are skilled at knowing 
whom to target, often focusing on those new to an area, or who have recently undergone some
personal or professional loss. Loneliness and a desire for meaning make one susceptible to friendly people
offering community. The recruitment process can be subtle, sometimes taking months
to establish a relationship. In fact, more than two-thirds
of cult members are recruited by a friend, family member, or co-worker whose invitations are harder to refuse. Once in the cult, members are subjected
to multiple forms of indoctrination. Some play on our natural inclination to
mimic social behaviors or follow orders. Other methods may be more intense using techniques of coercive persuasion
involving guilt, shame, and fear. And in many cases, members may
willingly submit out of desire to belong and to attain the promised rewards. The cult environment discourages
critical thinking, making it hard to voice doubts when everyone around you is modeling
absolute faith. The resulting internal conflict,
known as cognitive dissonance, keeps you trapped, as each compromise makes it more 
painful to admit you've been deceived. And though most cults don't
lead members to their death, they can still be harmful. By denying basic freedoms of thought,
speech, and association, cults stunt their members'
psychological and emotional growth, a particular problem for children, who are deprived of normal
developmental activities and milestones. Nevertheless, many cult members
eventually find a way out, whether through their own realizations, the help of family and friends, or when the cult falls apart
due to external pressure or scandals. Many cults may be hard to identify, and for some, their beliefs,
no matter how strange, are protected under religious freedom. But when their practices 
involve harassment, threats, illegal activities, or abuse, the law can intervene. Believing in something should not come
at the cost of your family and friends, and if someone tells you to sacrifice
your relationships or morality for the greater good, they're most likely exploiting you
for their own.

**Transcript**:
There are few places on Earth 
less hospitable to life than the bone-dry Sahara Desert. Yet it wasn't always this way. 100 million years ago, during a period
known as the Mid-Cretaceous, a gargantuan river system flowed
across the region from modern day Egypt to Morocco. The whole world at that time
would look rather different to us. The continents had yet to assume
their current positions. Extreme temperatures were common and fierce storms made life unpredictable. Dinosaurs flourished on land, pterosaurs roamed the skies, and giant marine reptiles and sharks
swam in warm seas. Small mammals, our ancestors,
lived quite literally in the shadow of these extraordinary creatures. In this world of huge predators, the River of Giants, which is what some call this region
of what is now northern Africa, stood out as particularly dangerous. In most ecosystems, it's lonely at
the top of the food chain. There usually isn't enough prey
to sustain many predators. Yet an incredible variety of aquatic
prey species in the river-based ecosystem may have allowed a large and diverse
population of apex predators to coexist. We know this thanks to a wealth of fossils
we found in an area called the Kem Kem Beds. Many of the predators we've discovered
had head and body shapes that made them uniquely adapted
to hunt the different types and sizes of aquatic prey. This allowed many Kem Kem predators to
take full advantage of the one abundant food source
in this environment: fish. This also allowed them 
to avoid direct competition with the predators going after
land-loving animals. Prey species in the river system had to
contend with attacks from all sides, including from above. Flying reptiles dominated the skies. Alanqa Saharica had a wingspan of
up to nine meters, and long slender jaws that helped it
snatch fish and small terrestrial animals. At least seven different types 
of crocodile-like predators patrolled the waterways, including the roughly 
ten-meter-long Elosuchus. And multiple species of T-rex-sized
carnivorous dinosaurs called theropods, lived side by side. In the River of Giants,
Spinosaurus was king. This 15-meter-long dinosaur was even
longer than T-rex, with short muscular hind legs, a flexible tail, and broad feet. It's two-meter-high sail warned
other creatures of its fearsome size and may have also been 
used to attract mates. Spinosaurus' long slender jaws were spiked
with conical teeth, perfect for swiftly clamping down
on slippery aquatic prey. This apex predator, 
as well as its ecosystem, is unparalleled in the history
of life on Earth. All that's left of these 
fearsome predators are fossils. About 93 million years ago, 
sea levels rose, submerging the Kem Kem region
in a shallow sea. Tens of millions of years later, an asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions, and associated changes in climate wiped out the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and
many other groups of animals and plants, including their unique ecoysystems. That mass extinction paved the way
for the rise of new kinds of birds, larger mammals, and eventually us.

Evaluation Response:
**MCQ Pair**:

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Which one of these countries is not a good place to hunt for Mesozoic fossils from North Africa?
Options: A. Morocco, B. Egypt, C. Tunisia, D. Mongolia
Correct Option: D

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What flavor of milkshake Judith ordered is not specified in the transcript?
Options: A. Vanilla, B. Strawberry, C. Chocolate, D. Both vanilla and strawberry
Correct Option: D

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.0000 (The generated question is completely unrelated to the ground truth question and the transcript content.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.0000 (The correct answer in the generated question does not match the ground truth answer.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.0000 (The distractors in the generated question are not plausible or relevant to the ground truth question.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 0.5000 (The generated question is clear and readable, but it is not relevant to the transcript or the ground truth question.)
- Total Score: 0.1250

Note: Since the generated MCQ does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, intent, or correct answer, the scores are very low. A better-generated MCQ would be one that is relevant to the transcript and the ground truth question, has plausible distractors, and matches the correct answer.
