**Transcript**:
As dawn breaks over a moveable city 
of ten thousand yurts, Queen Boraqchin is in 
for a rude awakening. A rogue sheep has slipped past her 
servants and guards and bolted into her yurt, where he springs into bed 
and bleats in her ear. Although she’s the formidable khatun 
of the Golden Horde, a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire, Boraqchin has a hands-on 
approach to ruling. She’s been married to Batu Khan, the fearsome grandson 
of Genghis Khan himself, since she was fifteen – and while her husband is out on his raids, she juggles the duties of flocks, 
family and empire at home. This makes her the manager – 
and the mover – of a city of thousands. Twice a year, Boraqchin moves the city 
between two seasonal camping grounds. This ensures constant water 
and lush grass in summer, and protection from harsh winds in winter. The whole operation requires 
weeks of strict planning, liaising with the other camps in her 
domain, strategic delegation – and the patience to move at the speed 
of dawdling animals. Today is moving day, and she’ll have to direct throngs of her
ladies, commanders, slaves and animals up the river Volga for the summer. As Boraqchin steps outside, she’s greeted by a commotion – her unwanted visitor is now running 
circles around her stewards. They’re attempting to stow her possessions
securely into wagons. Boraqchin orders them 
to get it under control – but she’s the only one quick 
enough to catch the stray. She next supervises her ladies who are
unpinning her yurt and lifting it onto its custom wagon. It requires a team of twenty oxen to pull, and Boraqchin wouldn’t trust anyone 
to steer it but herself. Next, Boraqchin and her woolly companion 
meet with the guards. She orders them to keep close watch
on her husband's special reception yurt and port-able throne during the journey. They’ll also act as outriders, and she tells them how to secure the 
route, surround her for safety – and keep the animals in check. But when the sheep finally breaks free 
and makes for the fields, the guards can barely keep up as it scampers through crowds 
packing up their yurts. Exasperated, Boraqchin rides down 
to the pastures herself. When she gets there, she catches sight of the troublesome sheep
wriggling into the middle of a flock. When she follows him in, he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother. She’s pregnant,
and seems to be in pain. With a start, Boraqchin realizes 
that this ewe’s impending delivery has been forgotten in 
the flurry of moving day. There’s no time to find a shepherd – instead, Boraqchin rolls up her sleeves, 
greases her arm and helps the ewe give birth to two new 
additions to the empire. Leaving the lambs and their mother, Boraqchin dashes back to the camp. Here the final touches have 
been put to packing, and vehicles are starting to line up. This vast procession starts with the queen and two hundred wagons 
filled with her treasures. Next up are the junior wives and crew, then the concubines – and this is only Boraqchin's camp. After this comes the second imperial camp led by another senior wife, then two more camps, also led by wives. Boraqchin has been checking in 
with them for weeks to ensure a smooth departure and orderly queue. But they only make up the 
royal portion of the line – behind them winds 
the entire civilian city, which includes holy men 
with portable chapels and mosques, families, tradesmen, and shepherds. Finally, Boraqchin settles into her wagon. It’ll take weeks to reach 
their destination – but over the course of the journey, she’ll keep everyone expertly in check – from her proud children 
and attentive subjects, to the most meandering sheep 
at the back of line.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent of Question 2 is to identify the empire in which Queen Boraqchin rules, which is closely related to identifying the Khanate in the Mongol Empire that she is the queen of. The correct option in Question 2 is the Mongolian Empire, but it mentions the Golden Horde as an option, which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more specific match can be found in the content of the transcript and the generated MCQs. The transcript mentions that Boraqchin is the "formidable khatun of the Golden Horde", which directly answers the ground truth MCQ.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask which Khanate in the Mongol Empire Boraqchin is the queen of. But if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 2, as it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: Who is responsible for helping a ewe give birth to two new lambs on the day mentioned in the transcript? Options: A. Batu Khan, B. A shepherd, C. A member of the queen's guards, D. Queen Boraqchin Correct Option: D

However, this question does not directly address the problem with the ewe. A more relevant question would be Question 10: What is the significance of the ewe's impending delivery being forgotten on the day mentioned in the transcript? Options: A. It was a chaotic situation that required the queen's attention, B. It was a deliberate decision to ignore it, C. It was not a significant event, D. It was a minor inconvenience Correct Option: A

But even this question does not directly ask about the problem with the ewe. Since there is no generated MCQ that directly asks about the problem with the ewe, the closest match would be Question 10.

However, if we were to choose a question that at least mentions the ewe, we could consider Question 6.

But since the ground truth MCQ asks about the problem with the ewe, and Question 10 does not directly address this, but rather addresses the significance of the situation, and Question 6 mentions the ewe but not the problem, it seems that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, among the given options, the closest match would be Question 10, but since it does not directly ask about the problem with the ewe, it is not a perfect match.

Considering all the aspects, I will choose Question 10 as the closest match.

**Transcript**:
As dawn breaks over a moveable city 
of ten thousand yurts, Queen Boraqchin is in 
for a rude awakening. A rogue sheep has slipped past her 
servants and guards and bolted into her yurt, where he springs into bed 
and bleats in her ear. Although she’s the formidable khatun 
of the Golden Horde, a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire, Boraqchin has a hands-on 
approach to ruling. She’s been married to Batu Khan, the fearsome grandson 
of Genghis Khan himself, since she was fifteen – and while her husband is out on his raids, she juggles the duties of flocks, 
family and empire at home. This makes her the manager – 
and the mover – of a city of thousands. Twice a year, Boraqchin moves the city 
between two seasonal camping grounds. This ensures constant water 
and lush grass in summer, and protection from harsh winds in winter. The whole operation requires 
weeks of strict planning, liaising with the other camps in her 
domain, strategic delegation – and the patience to move at the speed 
of dawdling animals. Today is moving day, and she’ll have to direct throngs of her
ladies, commanders, slaves and animals up the river Volga for the summer. As Boraqchin steps outside, she’s greeted by a commotion – her unwanted visitor is now running 
circles around her stewards. They’re attempting to stow her possessions
securely into wagons. Boraqchin orders them 
to get it under control – but she’s the only one quick 
enough to catch the stray. She next supervises her ladies who are
unpinning her yurt and lifting it onto its custom wagon. It requires a team of twenty oxen to pull, and Boraqchin wouldn’t trust anyone 
to steer it but herself. Next, Boraqchin and her woolly companion 
meet with the guards. She orders them to keep close watch
on her husband's special reception yurt and port-able throne during the journey. They’ll also act as outriders, and she tells them how to secure the 
route, surround her for safety – and keep the animals in check. But when the sheep finally breaks free 
and makes for the fields, the guards can barely keep up as it scampers through crowds 
packing up their yurts. Exasperated, Boraqchin rides down 
to the pastures herself. When she gets there, she catches sight of the troublesome sheep
wriggling into the middle of a flock. When she follows him in, he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother. She’s pregnant,
and seems to be in pain. With a start, Boraqchin realizes 
that this ewe’s impending delivery has been forgotten in 
the flurry of moving day. There’s no time to find a shepherd – instead, Boraqchin rolls up her sleeves, 
greases her arm and helps the ewe give birth to two new 
additions to the empire. Leaving the lambs and their mother, Boraqchin dashes back to the camp. Here the final touches have 
been put to packing, and vehicles are starting to line up. This vast procession starts with the queen and two hundred wagons 
filled with her treasures. Next up are the junior wives and crew, then the concubines – and this is only Boraqchin's camp. After this comes the second imperial camp led by another senior wife, then two more camps, also led by wives. Boraqchin has been checking in 
with them for weeks to ensure a smooth departure and orderly queue. But they only make up the 
royal portion of the line – behind them winds 
the entire civilian city, which includes holy men 
with portable chapels and mosques, families, tradesmen, and shepherds. Finally, Boraqchin settles into her wagon. It’ll take weeks to reach 
their destination – but over the course of the journey, she’ll keep everyone expertly in check – from her proud children 
and attentive subjects, to the most meandering sheep 
at the back of line.

**Transcript**:
In 1982, a young nurse was suffering
from severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t work, socialize, or even concentrate well enough
to read the newspaper. One treatment changed everything. After two courses of electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted. She went back to work, then on to graduate
school, where she earned high grades. At first, she talked openly about
her life changing treatment. But as she realized many people had an
extremely negative impression of ECT, she stopped sharing her experience. ECT carried a deep stigma, leftover from a history that bears little
resemblance to the modern procedure. The therapy was first
used in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors administered a
strong electrical current to the brain, causing a whole-body seizure
during which patients might bite their tongues
or even break bones. Modern ECT is very different. While a patient is under 
general anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series
of mild electrical pulses to the brain. This causes huge numbers of neurons
to fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure. A muscle relaxant keeps spasms
from spreading to the rest of his body. The only physical indication of the
electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts for about a minute,
and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an
hour after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases
of major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded
to other therapies, or who have had adverse 
reactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo 
treatment experience an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or
three sessions per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement
in their symptoms after just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less frequent
treatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than
it used to be, but patients can still 
experience side effects. They may feel achy, fatigued, 
or nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble remembering what
happened right before a session— for example, what they had for 
dinner the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble 
remembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory
loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its 
proven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons in the brain communicate via
electrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked
by ECT alters that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release
of certain neurotransmitters, molecules that help carry signals between
neurons and influence mental health. ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones
that may help reduce symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication, even in patients who were
resistant to medication before. As we come to a better 
understanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make 
ECT even more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after
her first course of ECT, the nurse decided to publish an
account of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding
the treatment, she worried that doing so
might negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference
for patients when all else failed. Though misperceptions about ECT persist, accounts like hers have helped make
doctors and patients alike aware of the treatment’s 
life changing potential.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of patients treated with ECT each year in the United States, while the generated MCQs focus on various aspects of ECT, such as its history, procedure, effectiveness, and applications.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 6: **Evaluation** is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of its focus on the effectiveness of ECT. Although it does not ask about the number of patients treated, it does provide information about the success rate of ECT, which is related to its widespread adoption and usage.

Therefore, I would recommend Question 6: **Evaluation** as the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ.

remembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory
loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its 
proven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons in the brain communicate via
electrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked
by ECT alters that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release
of certain neurotransmitters, molecules that help carry signals between
neurons and influence mental health. ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones
that may help reduce symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication, even in patients who were
resistant to medication before. As we come to a better 
understanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make 
ECT even more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after
her first course of ECT, the nurse decided to publish an
account of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding
the treatment, she worried that doing so
might negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 5: **Synthesis**.

Although the question stems are not identical, the intent and content of Question 5 align with the ground truth MCQ. Both questions focus on the treatment options for patients with treatment-resistant depression. The correct option in Question 5 mentions combining ECT with medication, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's focus on medications approved for treatment-resistant depression.

However, it's worth noting that the options in Question 5 do not directly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, which are specific classes of medications. If I had to choose a generated MCQ that more closely matches the options in the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match.

But based on the overall intent and content, I would recommend Question 5: **Synthesis** as the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1982, a young nurse was suffering
from severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t work, socialize, or even concentrate well enough
to read the newspaper. One treatment changed everything. After two courses of electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted. She went back to work, then on to graduate
school, where she earned high grades. At first, she talked openly about
her life changing treatment. But as she realized many people had an
extremely negative impression of ECT, she stopped sharing her experience. ECT carried a deep stigma, leftover from a history that bears little
resemblance to the modern procedure. The therapy was first
used in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors administered a
strong electrical current to the brain, causing a whole-body seizure
during which patients might bite their tongues
or even break bones. Modern ECT is very different. While a patient is under 
general anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series
of mild electrical pulses to the brain. This causes huge numbers of neurons
to fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure. A muscle relaxant keeps spasms
from spreading to the rest of his body. The only physical indication of the
electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts for about a minute,
and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an
hour after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases
of major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded
to other therapies, or who have had adverse 
reactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo 
treatment experience an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or
three sessions per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement
in their symptoms after just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less frequent
treatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than
it used to be, but patients can still 
experience side effects. They may feel achy, fatigued, 
or nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble remembering what
happened right before a session— for example, what they had for 
dinner the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble 
remembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory
loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent of the ground truth MCQ is to determine which diagnosis is not effectively treated with ECT. Question 3 provides information on the diagnoses that are commonly treated with ECT, which indirectly implies that other diagnoses (like schizophrenia) might not be effectively treated with ECT.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

This question is about the potential side effects of ECT, specifically memory loss, which is also the focus of the ground truth MCQ. While the options are not identical, the intent and content of the questions are similar, making Question 8 the most similar generated MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that the options in Question 8 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about a potential side effect that is NOT associated with ECT. A more similar question would have options that include side effects that are not associated with ECT, such as seizures (which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ).

If I had to choose an alternative, I would suggest Question 2, which mentions a whole-body seizure as an option, but this is not the focus of the question, and the intent is different.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 8.

hour after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases
of major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded
to other therapies, or who have had adverse 
reactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo 
treatment experience an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or
three sessions per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement
in their symptoms after just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less frequent
treatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than
it used to be, but patients can still 
experience side effects. They may feel achy, fatigued, 
or nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble remembering what
happened right before a session— for example, what they had for 
dinner the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble 
remembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory
loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its 
proven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons in the brain communicate via
electrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked
by ECT alters that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release
of certain neurotransmitters, molecules that help carry signals between
neurons and influence mental health. ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones
that may help reduce symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication, even in patients who were
resistant to medication before. As we come to a better 
understanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make 
ECT even more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after
her first course of ECT, the nurse decided to publish an
account of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding
the treatment, she worried that doing so
might negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference
for patients when all else failed. Though misperceptions about ECT persist, accounts like hers have helped make
doctors and patients alike aware of the treatment’s 
life changing potential.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the understanding of how ECT works, specifically whether scientists know exactly how it works. The correct answer is "False", indicating that the exact mechanism of ECT is not fully understood.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4: **Analysis** is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ. Although it does not directly ask if scientists know exactly how ECT works, it does provide options that describe the possible mechanisms by which ECT works, and the correct answer (D) suggests that ECT works through multiple mechanisms, implying that the exact process is complex and not fully understood.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
After years of experiments, you’ve finally created 
the pets of the future– nano-rabbits! They’re tiny, they’re fuzzy… and they multiply faster 
than the eye can see. In your lab there are 36 habitat cells, arranged in an inverted pyramid, with 8 cells in the top row. The first has one rabbit, the second has two, and so on, with eight rabbits in the last one. The other rows of cells are empty… for now. The rabbits are hermaphroditic, and each rabbit in a given 
cell will breed once with every rabbit in the horizontally 
adjacent cells, producing exactly one offspring each time. The newborn rabbits will 
drop into the cell directly below the 
two cells of its parents, and within minutes will mature 
and reproduce in turn. Each cell can hold 10^80 nano-rabbits – that’s a 1 followed by 80 zeros – before they break free 
and overrun the world. Your calculations have given you a 
46-digit number for the count of rabbits 
in the bottom cell– plenty of room to spare. But just as you pull the lever 
to start the experiment, your assistant runs in with terrible news. A rival lab has sabotaged your code so that all the zeros at the end 
of your results got cut off. That means you don’t actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold 
all the rabbits – and the reproduction is already underway! To make matters worse, your devices and calculators 
are all malfunctioning, so you only have a few minutes 
to work it out by hand. How many trailing zeros should there be at the end of the count of rabbits 
in the bottom habitat? And do you need to pull the emergency 
shut-down lever? Pause the video now if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough time to calculate the 
exact number of rabbits in the final cell. The good news is we don’t need to. All we need to figure out is how many trailing zeros it has. But how can we know how many trailing 
zeros a number has without calculating the number itself? What we do know is that we arrive at the
number of rabbits in the bottom cell through a process of multiplication – literally. The number of rabbits in each cell is the product of the number of rabbits 
in each of the two cells above it. And there are only two ways to get numbers with trailing zeros 
through multiplication: either multiplying a number ending in 5 
by any even number, or by multiplying numbers that have 
trailing zeroes themselves. Let’s calculate the number of rabbits 
in the second row and see what patterns emerge. Two of the numbers have trailing zeros – 20 rabbits in the fourth cell 
and 30 in the fifth cell. But there are no numbers ending in 5. And since the only way to get a number 
ending in 5 through multiplication is by starting with a number ending in 5, there won’t be any more 
down the line either. That means we only need to worry about the numbers that have 
trailing zeros themselves. And a neat trick to figure out the amount
of trailing zeros in a product is to count and add the trailing zeros 
in each of the factors – for example, 10 x 100 = 1,000. So let’s take the numbers in the fourth 
and fifth cells and multiply down from there. 20 and 30 each have one zero, so the product of both cells will have 
two trailing zeros, while the product of either cell and 
an adjacent non-zero-ending cell will have only one. When we continue all the way down, we end up with 35 zeros 
in the bottom cell. And if you’re not too stressed about 
the potential nano-rabbit apocalypse, you might notice that counting 
the zeros this way forms part of Pascal’s triangle. Adding those 35 zeros to the 
46 digit number we had before yields an 81 digit number – too big for the habitat to contain! You rush over and pull 
the emergency switch just as the seventh generation of rabbits 
was about to mature – hare-raisingly close to disaster.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of offspring produced by each pairing of rabbits. While there isn't a generated MCQ that directly asks this question, I found that Question 5 is somewhat related, as it asks about what happens to the newborn rabbits after they drop into the cell below their parents. However, this is not a direct match.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 5, but with a note that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
After years of experiments, you’ve finally created 
the pets of the future– nano-rabbits! They’re tiny, they’re fuzzy… and they multiply faster 
than the eye can see. In your lab there are 36 habitat cells, arranged in an inverted pyramid, with 8 cells in the top row. The first has one rabbit, the second has two, and so on, with eight rabbits in the last one. The other rows of cells are empty… for now. The rabbits are hermaphroditic, and each rabbit in a given 
cell will breed once with every rabbit in the horizontally 
adjacent cells, producing exactly one offspring each time. The newborn rabbits will 
drop into the cell directly below the 
two cells of its parents, and within minutes will mature 
and reproduce in turn. Each cell can hold 10^80 nano-rabbits – that’s a 1 followed by 80 zeros – before they break free 
and overrun the world. Your calculations have given you a 
46-digit number for the count of rabbits 
in the bottom cell– plenty of room to spare. But just as you pull the lever 
to start the experiment, your assistant runs in with terrible news. A rival lab has sabotaged your code so that all the zeros at the end 
of your results got cut off. That means you don’t actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold 
all the rabbits – and the reproduction is already underway! To make matters worse, your devices and calculators 
are all malfunctioning, so you only have a few minutes 
to work it out by hand. How many trailing zeros should there be at the end of the count of rabbits 
in the bottom habitat? And do you need to pull the emergency 
shut-down lever? Pause the video now if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough time to calculate the 
exact number of rabbits in the final cell. The good news is we don’t need to. All we need to figure out is how many trailing zeros it has. But how can we know how many trailing 
zeros a number has without calculating the number itself? What we do know is that we arrive at the
number of rabbits in the bottom cell through a process of multiplication – literally. The number of rabbits in each cell is the product of the number of rabbits 
in each of the two cells above it. And there are only two ways to get numbers with trailing zeros 
through multiplication: either multiplying a number ending in 5 
by any even number, or by multiplying numbers that have 
trailing zeroes themselves. Let’s calculate the number of rabbits 
in the second row and see what patterns emerge. Two of the numbers have trailing zeros – 20 rabbits in the fourth cell 
and 30 in the fifth cell. But there are no numbers ending in 5. And since the only way to get a number 
ending in 5 through multiplication is by starting with a number ending in 5, there won’t be any more 
down the line either. That means we only need to worry about the numbers that have 
trailing zeros themselves. And a neat trick to figure out the amount
of trailing zeros in a product is to count and add the trailing zeros 
in each of the factors – for example, 10 x 100 = 1,000. So let’s take the numbers in the fourth 
and fifth cells and multiply down from there. 20 and 30 each have one zero, so the product of both cells will have 
two trailing zeros, while the product of either cell and 
an adjacent non-zero-ending cell will have only one. When we continue all the way down, we end up with 35 zeros 
in the bottom cell. And if you’re not too stressed about 
the potential nano-rabbit apocalypse, you might notice that counting 
the zeros this way forms part of Pascal’s triangle. Adding those 35 zeros to the 
46 digit number we had before yields an 81 digit number – too big for the habitat to contain! You rush over and pull 
the emergency switch just as the seventh generation of rabbits 
was about to mature – hare-raisingly close to disaster.

The full scope of a nuclear detonation 
is almost unimaginable. Hopefully, no one will ever experience 
another of these catastrophic incidents. But there is a scientifically supported 
plan of action that could save hundreds 
of thousands of lives in the area surrounding 
a nuclear explosion. So what is this plan, and what exactly would it protect us from? To create their destructive blast, these weapons harness 
the power of nuclear fission– in which an atom’s nucleus 
is split in two. This process produces an incredible 
amount of energy, and in some materials the neutrons 
produced by one fission are absorbed by nearby atoms, splitting additional nuclei. These chain reactions can produce 
a range of explosive yields, but let’s consider an explosion 
equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT. An explosion like this would create a fireball capable of decimating 
a few city blocks and a shockwave damaging buildings 
several kilometers away. There is tragically nothing 
that can be done to save those in the fireball’s radius. However, for those in the 
shockwave and beyond, our scientifically supported protocol 
could be life saving. And though it may sound surprising, the best way to stay protected before, 
during, and after a nuclear detonation, is getting inside. Similar to protecting yourself 
from tornadoes or hurricanes, getting and staying inside a sturdy 
building would offer protection from the explosion’s shockwave, 
heat, and radiation. The shockwave of energy would travel several kilometers beyond the fireball’s 
radius in the first few seconds. Sturdy buildings within that range should
be able to withstand the shockwave, and staying in the centers and basements 
of these buildings also helps provide protection from 
heat and flying objects. Finding shelter is especially important 
if the fireball occurs close to the earth, as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt 
and debris several kilometers into the atmosphere. As the fireball cools, unstable atoms created by the nuclear 
fission mix with the debris to produce the most dangerous long-term 
effect of a nuclear detonation: radioactive particles called fallout. These sand-sized particles emit 
ionizing radiation, capable of separating electrons from 
molecules and atoms. Exposure to massive amounts of this 
radiation can result in cell damage, radiation burns, radiation sickness, 
cancer, and even death. Created several kilometers up, dangerous concentrations of this material would be driven by upper 
atmospheric winds, potentially leading to hazardous 
levels of fallout in areas up to tens of 
kilometers downwind. Thankfully, the same buildings that offer
protection from the blast are even better at 
guarding against fallout. Radiation is reduced as it travels 
through space and mass. So while a broken window and sealed window both have the same minimal 
effect on radiation, thick layers of steel, concrete, 
and packed earth can offer serious protection. And since fallout gives off half of its 
energy in the first hour and 80% in the first day, staying inside for 24 hours could 
dramatically improve the odds of avoiding the most serious 
effects of radiation. Following the blast there would be at 
least 15 minutes to find shelter before the fallout begins. Since the most hazardous fallout particles
are the heaviest, they sink through the air and collect on streets and rooftops, making ideal shelters underground 
or in the middle of high-rise buildings. But if someone were to get 
caught in the fallout, there are still measures they could take. After finding a safe space, they should remove their shoes 
and outer layers, wash any exposed skin, and store the contaminated 
clothing far away. Once inside, plan on staying there 
for at least 24 hours. If the shelter is poor, or someone 
inside needs urgent medical attention, try seeking outside help after an hour. But ideally, stay inside and stay tuned for more 
information from first responders. While electric power, cell service, and
Internet would be down, most radios would likely survive. So listen in for emergency responders to determine the safest course forward. Nuclear weapons are some of the most 
powerful tools of destruction on Earth, and it may seem naive to put faith in
these straightforward protective measures. But studies and simulations have 
repeatedly shown the benefits of getting inside. So while we’ll hopefully never need to, remember to Get Inside, Stay Inside, 
and Stay Tuned.

**Transcript**:
The full scope of a nuclear detonation 
is almost unimaginable. Hopefully, no one will ever experience 
another of these catastrophic incidents. But there is a scientifically supported 
plan of action that could save hundreds 
of thousands of lives in the area surrounding 
a nuclear explosion. So what is this plan, and what exactly would it protect us from? To create their destructive blast, these weapons harness 
the power of nuclear fission– in which an atom’s nucleus 
is split in two. This process produces an incredible 
amount of energy, and in some materials the neutrons 
produced by one fission are absorbed by nearby atoms, splitting additional nuclei. These chain reactions can produce 
a range of explosive yields, but let’s consider an explosion 
equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT. An explosion like this would create a fireball capable of decimating 
a few city blocks and a shockwave damaging buildings 
several kilometers away. There is tragically nothing 
that can be done to save those in the fireball’s radius. However, for those in the 
shockwave and beyond, our scientifically supported protocol 
could be life saving. And though it may sound surprising, the best way to stay protected before, 
during, and after a nuclear detonation, is getting inside. Similar to protecting yourself 
from tornadoes or hurricanes, getting and staying inside a sturdy 
building would offer protection from the explosion’s shockwave, 
heat, and radiation. The shockwave of energy would travel several kilometers beyond the fireball’s 
radius in the first few seconds. Sturdy buildings within that range should
be able to withstand the shockwave, and staying in the centers and basements 
of these buildings also helps provide protection from 
heat and flying objects. Finding shelter is especially important 
if the fireball occurs close to the earth, as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt 
and debris several kilometers into the atmosphere. As the fireball cools, unstable atoms created by the nuclear 
fission mix with the debris to produce the most dangerous long-term 
effect of a nuclear detonation: radioactive particles called fallout. These sand-sized particles emit 
ionizing radiation, capable of separating electrons from 
molecules and atoms. Exposure to massive amounts of this 
radiation can result in cell damage, radiation burns, radiation sickness, 
cancer, and even death. Created several kilometers up, dangerous concentrations of this material would be driven by upper 
atmospheric winds, potentially leading to hazardous 
levels of fallout in areas up to tens of 
kilometers downwind. Thankfully, the same buildings that offer
protection from the blast are even better at 
guarding against fallout. Radiation is reduced as it travels 
through space and mass. So while a broken window and sealed window both have the same minimal 
effect on radiation, thick layers of steel, concrete, 
and packed earth can offer serious protection. And since fallout gives off half of its 
energy in the first hour and 80% in the first day, staying inside for 24 hours could 
dramatically improve the odds of avoiding the most serious 
effects of radiation. Following the blast there would be at 
least 15 minutes to find shelter before the fallout begins. Since the most hazardous fallout particles
are the heaviest, they sink through the air and collect on streets and rooftops, making ideal shelters underground 
or in the middle of high-rise buildings. But if someone were to get 
caught in the fallout, there are still measures they could take. After finding a safe space, they should remove their shoes 
and outer layers, wash any exposed skin, and store the contaminated 
clothing far away. Once inside, plan on staying there 
for at least 24 hours. If the shelter is poor, or someone 
inside needs urgent medical attention, try seeking outside help after an hour. But ideally, stay inside and stay tuned for more 
information from first responders. While electric power, cell service, and
Internet would be down, most radios would likely survive. So listen in for emergency responders to determine the safest course forward. Nuclear weapons are some of the most 
powerful tools of destruction on Earth, and it may seem naive to put faith in
these straightforward protective measures. But studies and simulations have 
repeatedly shown the benefits of getting inside. So while we’ll hopefully never need to, remember to Get Inside, Stay Inside, 
and Stay Tuned.

**Transcript**:
[♪ INTRO] In April of 2014, under the control of an
Emergency Manager appointed by the state of Michigan to help the city
through an ongoing financial crisis, Flint, Michigan switched its water supply. For decades, the city’s water had been piped
in from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, which got its water from Lake Huron and treated it. But in April of 2013, the decision was made
to build a pipeline and connect to a new system, the Karegnondi Water Authority. This would supply the city with lake water
that Flint would treat instead of Detroit, and was estimated to save 200 million dollars
over 25 years. In the meantime, as a sort of temporary fix
while the pipeline was being built, water would come in from the Flint River and be
treated at Flint's water treatment plant. Now, 4 years after that switch, we know that
it damaged hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure, caused deadly bacterial
outbreaks that killed at least 12 people, and exposed thousands of children to high
levels of lead in their drinking water. There are places to learn about the story
of how this happened, was covered up, and was eventually recognized, and the underlying situations that caused these massive mistakes to be made. So let's talk about the science of water. And how something as seemingly simple as a
switching to a different water source could lead to so many bad, but also seemingly unrelated,
outcomes. Humans have actually been using lead pipes
in water systems for hundreds of years, dating back to the ancient Romans. We eventually moved on to using other materials,
like iron. But in the late 1800s, engineers in the U.S.
were all about lead, because lead pipes were easier to bend around obstacles and were a
bit more durable than iron. People were suffering from lead poisoning,
but the public health risks weren’t seriously acknowledged until around the 1920s. And we gradually stopped making new water
pipes from lead. But in lots of cities in the U.S., like Flint,
Michigan, there are still several different kinds of metals in pipes for water. In Flint’s case, the pipes are made of lead
and iron. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency didn’t
have any sort of serious regulation about lead pipes until the Lead and Copper Rule
was enacted in 1991. It requires regular monitoring and action
plans if old lead pipes start becoming dangerous. So, all that to say, lead water pipes are
not that unusual, a 2016 study estimates that
there are still millions in use. And even though no amount of lead ingested
by a human is considered safe, maybe surprisingly, many of these
water systems are usually safe. A big part of the reason why is anti-corrosion
chemicals in the water, like orthophosphate. Orthophosphate helps lead and some other metal
pipes from corroding by forming a compound that makes a sort of protective layer on the
inside of the pipe. If that layer is patchy or missing, then electron-stealing
chemicals called oxidants, like dissolved oxygen gas, can react with the lead. And when that happens, the lead will dissolve
into the water and contaminate it. You’ve probably heard of that. It’s known as leaching, and it’s when
things get dangerous for people who need this water to drink or shower or do anything with
on their bodies. Flint, and it is unclear why besides possibly
cutting costs, did not add orthophosphate or any sort of anti-corrosion chemicals when
switching to Flint River water. Even though the treated water from Detroit
had had them. And because Flint was using iron and lead
pipes, both iron and lead ended up in the water. But that’s not the whole story. Not only were these pipes left unprotected,
but the water flowing through them also contained higher than average chloride levels. Research has found that chloride helps the
process of corrosion along. When there are enough chloride ions in the
water compared to some other ions, they start forming chemical complexes with lead and other
atoms. And these chloride complexes are soluble. So, basically, it’s another way that lead
can get into the water. Part of this too-much-chloride problem was
from the river water itself. Sodium chloride, which is just table salt,
would often wash into the river after being used as a de-icer on roads. But another part of it had to do with the
fact that, a couple of months after the switch to the Flint River water, there was also a
huge bacterial problem. The river water wasn’t just, like, extremely
dangerous, though. We know how to treat water. We put in disinfectants like chlorine, which can rip
open bacteria or mess with the molecules inside them. But it turns out that chlorine disinfectant
can react with metals from corroding pipes, especially iron, to become completely different compounds that do absolutely
nothing to control bacteria. So the disinfectants were made useless. Plus, more chloride ions ended up floating
around, which only made the corrosion process worse. And thus, the vicious cycle escalated. By August of 2014, there was a city warning
that E. coli and other typically gut-dwelling bacteria, collectively called fecal coliform
bacteria, were thriving in the water and could make people sick. The Flint treatment plant upped the amount
of chlorine they were using to try to kill off these contaminants. But because the pipes were already corroding,
it wasn’t working. Not only that, but all this extra chlorine
they were adding also reacted with some of the organic chemicals from the river water
to form disinfection byproducts called trihalomethanes. And, researchers have found trihalomethanes
to be linked to health problems and even cancer. So not only was the chlorine turning into
a bunch of non-disinfectant chemicals, one of those was potentially a carcinogen. Trihalomethanes in the water quickly swelled
to above the national regulatory limit. So to try and fix that problem, the treatment
plant added coagulants that would react with the organic matter in the water to help them
filter it out. Specifically, they used a chemical called
ferric chloride. Which took care of the trihalomethanes, but meant they were adding
even more chloride to the water. As the pipes got worse and more chlorine was
turned into useless compounds, the elevated bacterial levels became deadly. Between April 2014 and October 2015, at least
12 people died and 91 people got sick from an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, the
third largest recorded in U.S. history. Before the switch to the Flint River water,
there were only a handful of cases per year. Legionnaires’ disease is basically a really
intense pneumonia. It’s caused by breathing in water-borne
bacteria that infect the lungs so they get inflamed and lead to other symptoms. This outbreak was caused by a bacterium called
Legionella pneumophila, specifically the serogroup 6 strain, which isn’t usually detected in
the standard urine test for the disease. After some extensive studies, most researchers
agree that this chlorine inactivation at least played a part in letting these bacteria flourish. On top of that, some of the experts and investigative journalists think that there could have been more deaths than were officially confirmed, because of how tricky it can be
to diagnose Legionnaires’ disease. Some deaths caused by these bacterias could
have been attributed to pneumonia in general, and thus not counted. So, counterintuitive as it might seem, not
adding corrosion control also deactivated the chlorine disinfectant to basically undetectable
levels, resulting in tragic loss of life. In addition to all this, though, there was the ongoing
problem of metals leaching into the water supply. Which we definitely know was because of how
the Flint River water was treated. Because of all these chemical reactions, the
process by which lead and other metals got into the water was not slow and constant. Sometimes the pipes would leach metal slowly. But sometimes metal compounds, like the protective
layer that wasn’t being maintained, flaked off in little hunks, some of which were even
visible to the naked eye. The leached iron made the water look kind
of horrible and taste kind of rusty, but it isn’t a big health concern on its own. Lead is. But you can’t see, smell, or taste it in
water. A single tiny lead flake can take water from
safe, to far over the EPA’s limit of 15 parts per billion, which requires public action
to be taken. And besides randomly super contaminated samples
being right next to uncontaminated samples because of flakes, the protocols for testing
for lead can be manipulated to make it less likely to record how contaminated the water
actually is. Official EPA protocols for measuring drinking
water quality involves letting the water sit in pipes for at least 6 hours, and then collecting
it after a couple minutes. City protocols called for pre-flushing
the pipes for five minutes before letting them sit for 6 hours. And, according to experts, this pre-flushing
can sweep out initial bursts of lead particles so they’re not in the sample. Plus, people don’t just go turning on their
water every once in a while, so those samples aren’t necessarily reflective of what they’re
using and drinking. Even still, when the City of Flint tested
one resident’s water in February and March of 2015, they found lead levels at 104 ppb
and 397 ppb, far above the EPA’s action level. When researchers from Virginia Tech sampled
water from the same pipes at low, medium, and high flow rates, they found levels ranging
from 220 ppb to a whopping 13,200 ppb. And, to be totally clear about how intense
this is, a substance with more than 5,000 parts per billion of lead is considered hazardous
waste by the EPA. By September 2015, those same researchers
had collected and analyzed 252 water samples from various Flint homes. 101 of the samples had more than 5 ppb of
lead. And they estimated that 90% of homes had a
lead level below 25 ppb; 10% were above that. Which, and I can’t say this enough, was a lot of homes above that 15 parts per billion EPA limit for water. Protocols matter, y'all! So that's how metals ended up in the water. No corrosion control and high
corrosive chemical concentrations exposed many thousands
of people to lead poisoning. And lead poisoning can cause incredibly serious
health problems. Lead interferes with a lot of different enzymes,
can cause cells to die, and can slip past the protective blood-brain barrier to seriously
mess with the central nervous system. We don’t know exactly how it interacts with
all those systems, but lead ions are chemically pretty similar to calcium ions, which our
bodies use all the time in lots of chemical processes. So that may have something to do with it. In any case, it’s incredibly detrimental
to human bodies and brains, in adults and especially in children. All of this was made worse by the fact that
the city of Flint has a water system built to deliver water to over 200,000 people. Since the population peaked at around that in
the 1960s, it has declined to less than half that. So in some areas, the water moved through
some pipes slowly or sat stagnant. As the Flint River water sat in the pipes
and the corrosive chemistry did its thing, metal concentration rose, disinfectant concentration
decreased, and bacterial growth increased. The city of Flint switched back to piping
in treated water from the Detroit water system in October 2015, after 18 months. And they’re adding in extra phosphate chemicals
to try to build up that protective layer again. But that doesn't just fix the problem that
had escalated over that year and a half. The pipes have already corroded, as have plumbing
fixtures and water heaters of many residents. So while the gradual leaching is hopefully
going down, metal flakes may still be chipping off. Tests show that lead levels are down,
and that’s great news, but many residents have also, understandably, lost faith in the government agencies that are now
reporting that the water is safe. The city is now undergoing a massively expensive
process of replacing all of its lead pipes. A step that was taken to save money has ended
up costing far more money than it could have saved, not to mention lost health, and lost
lives. The way that science was ignored, unknown,
or even misused in this story is a lesson that we all have to live with, and one that

**Transcript**:
Loki the mischief-maker, was writhing
uncomfortably in Thor’s iron grip. The previous night, while the rest of the
gods slept, he’d snuck up on Thor’s wife Sif and shorn off her beautiful hair. It’d seemed like a funny 
prank at the time, but now Thor was about to
break every bone in his body. Loki had to think of some
way to fix what he’d done. Yet who could replace Sif’s matchless
hair, golden like a field of summer wheat? The dwarves! – their legendary
smiths could make anything. So Loki rushed to their realm, 
deep within the mountains of the earth. Even before he arrived, the wily Loki was
already scheming how he would get the
dwarves to do his bidding. He decided that his best bet was to pit
two families against each other. He first visited the masterful
sons of Ivaldi.  He told them that their rivals,
a pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri, had claimed that they were the best
craftsmen in the world and were determined to prove
it in a competition. The rules were that each family had to 
create three gifts for the gods, including, for the Ivaldis, golden hair. Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri,
and told them the same thing,  only now claiming that the sons
of Ivaldi had issued the challenge. But Brokk and Eitri couldn’t 
be fooled so easily, and only agreed to participate
if Loki put his own head on the line. Literally—if Brokk and Eitri won, 
Loki would forfeit his head to them. Loki had no choice but to agree,
and to save himself had to find a way to make sure the sons of
Ivaldi emerged victorious. Both sets of dwarves got to work. Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows and
told him not to stop for any reason, or the treasures would be ruined. Soon a strange black fly
flew into the room. As a piece of pigskin was placed in the
forge, the fly stung Brokk’s hand, but he didn’t flinch. Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,
the fly bit Brokk on the neck. The dwarf carried on. Finally, Eitri placed a piece
of iron in the furnace. This time the fly landed right on Brokk’s
eyelid and bit as hard as it could. And for just a split second,
Brokk’s hand left the bellows. That’s all it took; their final treasure
hadn’t stayed in the fire long enough. Loki now reappeared in his normal form,
overjoyed by their failure, and accompanied the dwarves to present
their treasures to the gods. First, Loki presented the treasures
from the sons of Ivaldi. Their golden hair bound to Sif’s
head and continued to grow, leaving her even more radiant than before. Next, for Odin the all-father, a magnificent spear that could
pierce through anything. And finally a small cloth that unfolded
into a mighty ship built for Freyr, god of the harvest. Then Brokk presented the treasures
made by him and his brother. For Freyr they’d forged 
a golden-bristled boar who’d pull Freyr’s chariot across
the sky faster than any mount. For Odin, a golden arm ring which would
make eight more identical rings on every ninth night. And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir. Its handle was too short,
and Loki smirked at the obvious defect. But then Brokk revealed its abilities. Mjolnir would never shatter, 
never miss its mark and always return
to Thor’s hand when thrown. Despite the short handle, the gods all 
agreed this was the finest gift of all. Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried 
to flee, but Thor reached him first. But before the dwarves could have their due, clever Loki pointed out that they had won
the rights to his head, but not his neck, and thus had no right to cut it. All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,
but Brokk would have the last laugh. Taking his brother’s awl,
he pierced it through Loki’s lips and sewed his mouth shut, so the trickster god could no longer
spread his malicious deceit. Yet the irony was not lost on the gods. For it was Loki’s deceit that had brought
them these fine treasures and given Thor the hammer
for which he’s still known today.

**Transcript**:
Loki the mischief-maker, was writhing
uncomfortably in Thor’s iron grip. The previous night, while the rest of the
gods slept, he’d snuck up on Thor’s wife Sif and shorn off her beautiful hair. It’d seemed like a funny 
prank at the time, but now Thor was about to
break every bone in his body. Loki had to think of some
way to fix what he’d done. Yet who could replace Sif’s matchless
hair, golden like a field of summer wheat? The dwarves! – their legendary
smiths could make anything. So Loki rushed to their realm, 
deep within the mountains of the earth. Even before he arrived, the wily Loki was
already scheming how he would get the
dwarves to do his bidding. He decided that his best bet was to pit
two families against each other. He first visited the masterful
sons of Ivaldi.  He told them that their rivals,
a pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri, had claimed that they were the best
craftsmen in the world and were determined to prove
it in a competition. The rules were that each family had to 
create three gifts for the gods, including, for the Ivaldis, golden hair. Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri,
and told them the same thing,  only now claiming that the sons
of Ivaldi had issued the challenge. But Brokk and Eitri couldn’t 
be fooled so easily, and only agreed to participate
if Loki put his own head on the line. Literally—if Brokk and Eitri won, 
Loki would forfeit his head to them. Loki had no choice but to agree,
and to save himself had to find a way to make sure the sons of
Ivaldi emerged victorious. Both sets of dwarves got to work. Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows and
told him not to stop for any reason, or the treasures would be ruined. Soon a strange black fly
flew into the room. As a piece of pigskin was placed in the
forge, the fly stung Brokk’s hand, but he didn’t flinch. Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,
the fly bit Brokk on the neck. The dwarf carried on. Finally, Eitri placed a piece
of iron in the furnace. This time the fly landed right on Brokk’s
eyelid and bit as hard as it could. And for just a split second,
Brokk’s hand left the bellows. That’s all it took; their final treasure
hadn’t stayed in the fire long enough. Loki now reappeared in his normal form,
overjoyed by their failure, and accompanied the dwarves to present
their treasures to the gods. First, Loki presented the treasures
from the sons of Ivaldi. Their golden hair bound to Sif’s
head and continued to grow, leaving her even more radiant than before. Next, for Odin the all-father, a magnificent spear that could
pierce through anything. And finally a small cloth that unfolded
into a mighty ship built for Freyr, god of the harvest. Then Brokk presented the treasures
made by him and his brother. For Freyr they’d forged 
a golden-bristled boar who’d pull Freyr’s chariot across
the sky faster than any mount. For Odin, a golden arm ring which would
make eight more identical rings on every ninth night. And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir. Its handle was too short,
and Loki smirked at the obvious defect. But then Brokk revealed its abilities. Mjolnir would never shatter, 
never miss its mark and always return
to Thor’s hand when thrown. Despite the short handle, the gods all 
agreed this was the finest gift of all. Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried 
to flee, but Thor reached him first. But before the dwarves could have their due, clever Loki pointed out that they had won
the rights to his head, but not his neck, and thus had no right to cut it. All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,
but Brokk would have the last laugh. Taking his brother’s awl,
he pierced it through Loki’s lips and sewed his mouth shut, so the trickster god could no longer
spread his malicious deceit. Yet the irony was not lost on the gods. For it was Loki’s deceit that had brought
them these fine treasures and given Thor the hammer
for which he’s still known today.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 5: What happened to Brokk's hand while he was working the bellows? Options: A. He got a burn, B. He got a cut, C. He got stung by a black fly, D. He got a cold Correct Option: C

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not mention Loki turning himself into a fly. But among the given options, this is the closest match.

A more accurate match would be a question that directly asks about Loki's transformation into a fly. Unfortunately, such a question is not present in the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose Question 5 (Index 5), but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

After re-reading the generated MCQs, I noticed that none of them directly ask about Loki's transformation into a fly. However, I can infer that the correct answer is related to the event where Loki turns himself into a fly to distract Brokk.

With that in mind, I would recommend creating a new question that directly asks about Loki's transformation, such as:

What did Loki transform himself into to distract Brokk during the competition?

Options: A. A fly, B. A bat, C. A mosquito, D. A butterfly

Correct Option: A

This new question would be a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship
Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight, leaving only 118 of her 
2,200 crew members alive. But when a British destroyer came to
collect the prisoners, they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white
cat clinging to a floating plank. For the next several months this cat
hunted rats and raised British morale - until a sudden torpedo strike shattered
the hull and sank the ship. But, miraculously, not the cat. Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessels – one of which also sank - before
retiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors. Many may not think of cats as serviceable
sailors, or cooperative companions 
of any kind. But cats have been working alongside
humans for thousands of years -  helping us just as often as we help them. So how did these solitary creatures go 
from wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick? The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than
10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era. People were learning to bend nature
to their will, producing much more food than
farmers could eat at one time. These Neolithic farmers stored their excess
grain in large pits and short, clay silos. But these stores of food attracted
hordes of rodents, as well as their predator,
Felis silvestris lybica - the wildcat found across North Africa
and Southwest Asia. These wildcats were fast, fierce,
carnivorous hunters. And they were remarkably similar in size
and appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient
wildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social
towards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested 
granaries drew in these typically solitary animals.  And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the 
presence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated
the cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that
the cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe
and the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major
scourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and
gnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become
essential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian
globe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated 
their own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch
venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important
to Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,
hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate
from port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,
ships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the
central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, 
Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern

**Transcript**:
On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship
Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight, leaving only 118 of her 
2,200 crew members alive. But when a British destroyer came to
collect the prisoners, they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white
cat clinging to a floating plank. For the next several months this cat
hunted rats and raised British morale - until a sudden torpedo strike shattered
the hull and sank the ship. But, miraculously, not the cat. Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessels – one of which also sank - before
retiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors. Many may not think of cats as serviceable
sailors, or cooperative companions 
of any kind. But cats have been working alongside
humans for thousands of years -  helping us just as often as we help them. So how did these solitary creatures go 
from wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick? The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than
10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era. People were learning to bend nature
to their will, producing much more food than
farmers could eat at one time. These Neolithic farmers stored their excess
grain in large pits and short, clay silos. But these stores of food attracted
hordes of rodents, as well as their predator,
Felis silvestris lybica - the wildcat found across North Africa
and Southwest Asia. These wildcats were fast, fierce,
carnivorous hunters. And they were remarkably similar in size
and appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient
wildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social
towards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested 
granaries drew in these typically solitary animals.  And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the 
presence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated
the cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that
the cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe
and the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major
scourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and
gnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become
essential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian
globe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated 
their own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch
venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important
to Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,
hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate
from port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,
ships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the
central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, 
Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern 
and North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point -- 
continued to travel across Europe, eventually setting sail for
Australia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern
or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica. But close analysis of the genomes and

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What is the origin of the modern house cat? Options: A. The Fertile Crescent, B. The Nile River, C. The Mediterranean Sea, D. The Indian Ocean Correct Option: A.

However, this question does not directly ask about the time frame of the relationship between humans and cats. A more accurate match would be a question that asks about the time frame of this relationship.

A closer match would be a generated question that asks: "How long ago did the domestication of the modern house cat occur?" or "When did the close relationship between humans and cats begin?" Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match this question.

However, Question 7 does provide information about the origin of the modern house cat, which is related to the time frame of the relationship between humans and cats. According to the transcript, the domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent.

Therefore, I would recommend Question 7 as the most similar generated MCQ, with the understanding that it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship
Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight, leaving only 118 of her 
2,200 crew members alive. But when a British destroyer came to
collect the prisoners, they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white
cat clinging to a floating plank. For the next several months this cat
hunted rats and raised British morale - until a sudden torpedo strike shattered
the hull and sank the ship. But, miraculously, not the cat. Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessels – one of which also sank - before
retiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors. Many may not think of cats as serviceable
sailors, or cooperative companions 
of any kind. But cats have been working alongside
humans for thousands of years -  helping us just as often as we help them. So how did these solitary creatures go 
from wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick? The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than
10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era. People were learning to bend nature
to their will, producing much more food than
farmers could eat at one time. These Neolithic farmers stored their excess
grain in large pits and short, clay silos. But these stores of food attracted
hordes of rodents, as well as their predator,
Felis silvestris lybica - the wildcat found across North Africa
and Southwest Asia. These wildcats were fast, fierce,
carnivorous hunters. And they were remarkably similar in size
and appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient
wildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social
towards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested 
granaries drew in these typically solitary animals.  And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the 
presence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated
the cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that
the cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe
and the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major
scourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and
gnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become
essential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian
globe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated 
their own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch
venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important
to Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,
hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate
from port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,
ships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the
central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, 
Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern 
and North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point -- 
continued to travel across Europe, eventually setting sail for
Australia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern
or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica. But close analysis of the genomes and
coat patterns of modern cats tells us that unlike dogs, which have undergone 
centuries of selective breeding, modern cats are genetically
very similar to ancient cats. And apart from making them
more social and docile, we’ve done little to alter
their natural behaviors. In other words, cats today are more or
less as they’ve always been: Wild animals. Fierce hunters. Creatures that don’t
see us as their keepers. And given our long history together,
they might not be wrong.

However, this question does not directly address how ancient cats spread. A more relevant question would be one that discusses migration or spreading of cats.

A more suitable match would be Question 7: What is the origin of the modern house cat? Options: A. The Fertile Crescent, B. The Nile River, C. The Mediterranean Sea, D. The Indian Ocean Correct Option: A, as it partially addresses the migration of cats from the Fertile Crescent.

However, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 7 (Index: 7), as it is the closest match in terms of discussing the origin and migration of cats.

**Transcript**:
You’ve discovered a doorway
to another realm, and now you and your brother  are off exploring the wonderful
world of Paradoxica. Fantastically paradoxical creatures crawl,
run, and fly around you. And then you see the troll. It’s catching all the creatures
in an enormous net. You bravely step forward
and demand it let them go. The troll laughs. “If you’re such a
fan of paradoxes,” it says, “then I’ll make you an offer. If you say something true,
I’ll release all these creatures." You’re about to say, “You are a troll,” but before you can,
the troll grabs your brother. “If you say something false,”
he continues, “then I’ll release your brother." Your statement can 
only be a single sentence. And as you can see,
I hate paradoxes more than anything. If you try to cheat
by saying something paradoxical, like, ‘this statement is false,’ then I'll eat your brother 
and the creatures." What true/false statement
can you say to force the troll to free your brother
and the paradoxical creatures? [Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out for yourself!] Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This seems like an impossible situation, but incredibly, you can say something that will force the troll to
release all its prisoners. This is an example of coercive logic, invented by the great logician 
and puzzle creator Raymond Smullyan. The trick Smullyan came up with
involves saying a statement whose truth or falseness depends on
what you want the troll to do. Your statement still
has to be carefully crafted. For example, if you were to say, “You are going to free the 
creatures and my brother,” the troll could respond, “that’s false… 
I’m only going to free your brother.” Similarly, if you said, “You will free 
the paradoxes,” the troll could say, “That’s true,” 
and free the paradoxes. But watch what happens if you say,
“You will free my brother.” The statement can’t be false, because if it were, the troll, 
by its own rules, would have to free your brother. That would make the statement
paradoxically true and false. But the troll hates paradoxes and would never willingly create one. So his only option 
is for the statement to be true. If “you will free my brother” is true, then the troll 
has to release your brother. And by its own rules, the troll
has to free the creatures as well, since you said a true statement. By wielding just 5 words
like a logical scalpel, you’ve forced the troll
to free all its prisoners. As the troll stomps off in anger, the paradoxes cheer you
for winning them their freedom, and promise to lead you to the
treasure at the top of the stairs. If you can reach it.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You’ve discovered a doorway
to another realm, and now you and your brother  are off exploring the wonderful
world of Paradoxica. Fantastically paradoxical creatures crawl,
run, and fly around you. And then you see the troll. It’s catching all the creatures
in an enormous net. You bravely step forward
and demand it let them go. The troll laughs. “If you’re such a
fan of paradoxes,” it says, “then I’ll make you an offer. If you say something true,
I’ll release all these creatures." You’re about to say, “You are a troll,” but before you can,
the troll grabs your brother. “If you say something false,”
he continues, “then I’ll release your brother." Your statement can 
only be a single sentence. And as you can see,
I hate paradoxes more than anything. If you try to cheat
by saying something paradoxical, like, ‘this statement is false,’ then I'll eat your brother 
and the creatures." What true/false statement
can you say to force the troll to free your brother
and the paradoxical creatures? [Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out for yourself!] Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This seems like an impossible situation, but incredibly, you can say something that will force the troll to
release all its prisoners. This is an example of coercive logic, invented by the great logician 
and puzzle creator Raymond Smullyan. The trick Smullyan came up with
involves saying a statement whose truth or falseness depends on
what you want the troll to do. Your statement still
has to be carefully crafted. For example, if you were to say, “You are going to free the 
creatures and my brother,” the troll could respond, “that’s false… 
I’m only going to free your brother.” Similarly, if you said, “You will free 
the paradoxes,” the troll could say, “That’s true,” 
and free the paradoxes. But watch what happens if you say,
“You will free my brother.” The statement can’t be false, because if it were, the troll, 
by its own rules, would have to free your brother. That would make the statement
paradoxically true and false. But the troll hates paradoxes and would never willingly create one. So his only option 
is for the statement to be true. If “you will free my brother” is true, then the troll 
has to release your brother. And by its own rules, the troll
has to free the creatures as well, since you said a true statement. By wielding just 5 words
like a logical scalpel, you’ve forced the troll
to free all its prisoners. As the troll stomps off in anger, the paradoxes cheer you
for winning them their freedom, and promise to lead you to the
treasure at the top of the stairs. If you can reach it.

**Transcript**:
A male firefly glows above a field 
on a summer’s night, emitting a series of enticing flashes. He hopes a nearby female will respond
with her own lightshow and mate with him. Sadly for this male, it won’t turn out quite the way he plans. A female from a different species 
mimics his pulsing patterns: by tricking the male with 
her promise of partnership, she lures him in– and turns him into an easy meal. He’s been deceived. Behavioral biologists have identified 
three defining hallmarks of deception by non-human animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it can’t simply be an accident. In this case we know that the predatory 
firefly’s signal isn’t an accident because she flexibly 
adjusts her flash pattern to match males of different species. Based on this definition, where is animal deception seen in nature? Camouflage is a good starting point– and one of the most familiar examples 
of animal trickery. The leaf-tailed gecko and the 
octopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces 
on which they rest. Other animals use mimicry 
to protect themselves. Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved 
red, yellow, and black patterns resembling those of the venomous 
eastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warnings 
these markings convey. Even some plants use mimicry: there are orchids that look and smell like
female wasps to attract hapless males, who end up pollinating the plant. Some of these animals benefit 
by having fixed characteristics that are evolutionary suited 
to their environments. But in other cases, the deceiver seems to anticipate 
the reactions of other animals and to adjust its behavior accordingly. Sensing a threat, the octopus will rapidly change its colors
to match its surroundings. Dwarf chameleons color-match their 
environments more closely when they see a bird predator 
rather than a snake– birds, after all, 
have better color vision. One of the more fascinating 
examples of animal deception comes from the fork-tailed drongo. This bird sits atop tall trees 
in the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for predators 
and calling when it senses a threat. That sends meerkats, pied babblers, 
and others dashing for cover. But the drongo will also sound 
a false alarm when those other species 
have captured prey. As the meerkats and babblers flee, the drongo swoops down 
to steal their catches. This tactic works about half the time– and it provides drongos 
with much of their food. There are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members 
of their own species, but that happens too. Consider the mantis shrimp. Like other crustaceans, it molts as it grows, which leaves its soft body 
vulnerable to attack. But it’s still driven to protect 
its home against rivals. So it has become a masterful bluffer. Despite being fragile, a newly molted shrimp is actually 
more likely to threaten intruders, spreading the large limbs it usually uses 
to strike or stab its opponents. And that works – bluffers are more likely to keep 
their homes than non-bluffers. In its softened condition, a mantis shrimp couldn’t 
withstand a fight– which is why we can be confident that its behavior is a bluff. Biologists have even noticed 
that its bluffs are tactical: newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely
to bluff against smaller rivals, who are especially likely 
to be driven away. It would seem that instead of just 
threatening reflexively, the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the 
situation and predicting others’ behavior, to get the best result. So we know that animals can deceive, but do they do so with intent? That’s a difficult question, and many scientists think 
we'll never be able to answer it. We can't observe animals’ 
internal thoughts. But we don’t need to know what an animal 
is thinking in order to detect deception. By watching behavior and its outcomes, we learn that animals manipulate 
predators, prey, and rivals, and that their capacity for deception can be surprisingly complex.

and calling when it senses a threat. That sends meerkats, pied babblers, 
and others dashing for cover. But the drongo will also sound 
a false alarm when those other species 
have captured prey. As the meerkats and babblers flee, the drongo swoops down 
to steal their catches. This tactic works about half the time– and it provides drongos 
with much of their food. There are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members 
of their own species, but that happens too. Consider the mantis shrimp. Like other crustaceans, it molts as it grows, which leaves its soft body 
vulnerable to attack. But it’s still driven to protect 
its home against rivals. So it has become a masterful bluffer. Despite being fragile, a newly molted shrimp is actually 
more likely to threaten intruders, spreading the large limbs it usually uses 
to strike or stab its opponents. And that works – bluffers are more likely to keep 
their homes than non-bluffers. In its softened condition, a mantis shrimp couldn’t 
withstand a fight– which is why we can be confident that its behavior is a bluff. Biologists have even noticed 
that its bluffs are tactical: newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely
to bluff against smaller rivals, who are especially likely 
to be driven away. It would seem that instead of just 
threatening reflexively, the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the 
situation and predicting others’ behavior, to get the best result. So we know that animals can deceive, but do they do so with intent? That’s a difficult question, and many scientists think 
we'll never be able to answer it. We can't observe animals’ 
internal thoughts. But we don’t need to know what an animal 
is thinking in order to detect deception. By watching behavior and its outcomes, we learn that animals manipulate 
predators, prey, and rivals, and that their capacity for deception can be surprisingly complex.

**Transcript**:
A male firefly glows above a field 
on a summer’s night, emitting a series of enticing flashes. He hopes a nearby female will respond
with her own lightshow and mate with him. Sadly for this male, it won’t turn out quite the way he plans. A female from a different species 
mimics his pulsing patterns: by tricking the male with 
her promise of partnership, she lures him in– and turns him into an easy meal. He’s been deceived. Behavioral biologists have identified 
three defining hallmarks of deception by non-human animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it can’t simply be an accident. In this case we know that the predatory 
firefly’s signal isn’t an accident because she flexibly 
adjusts her flash pattern to match males of different species. Based on this definition, where is animal deception seen in nature? Camouflage is a good starting point– and one of the most familiar examples 
of animal trickery. The leaf-tailed gecko and the 
octopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces 
on which they rest. Other animals use mimicry 
to protect themselves. Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved 
red, yellow, and black patterns resembling those of the venomous 
eastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warnings 
these markings convey. Even some plants use mimicry: there are orchids that look and smell like
female wasps to attract hapless males, who end up pollinating the plant. Some of these animals benefit 
by having fixed characteristics that are evolutionary suited 
to their environments. But in other cases, the deceiver seems to anticipate 
the reactions of other animals and to adjust its behavior accordingly. Sensing a threat, the octopus will rapidly change its colors
to match its surroundings. Dwarf chameleons color-match their 
environments more closely when they see a bird predator 
rather than a snake– birds, after all, 
have better color vision. One of the more fascinating 
examples of animal deception comes from the fork-tailed drongo. This bird sits atop tall trees 
in the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for predators

**Transcript**:
Roald Amundsen had spent nearly two
years preparing his Arctic expedition. He had secured funding from the Norwegian
Crown and hand-picked a trusted crew. He’d even received the blessing of
the famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen, along with the use of his ship, Fram, 
specially constructed to withstand the ice. Now, with the voyage departing, he had 
one final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the
opposite direction. By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had
been visited and mapped, with only two key locations
remaining: the North Pole, deep in the
frozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a
recently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of
reaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers
Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims
to the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to
what he called “the last great problem.” But Amundsen’s crew weren’t 
the only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had
already visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own 
South Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova 
reached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news
that Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted
against the Norwegian in what the newspapers 
called a ‘race to the Pole.’ Yet if it was a race,
it was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times
from different locations, and they had very different 
plans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely
on reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and 
Norwegian experience, arriving with a small team of
men and more than a hundred dogs. His explorers were clothed
in sealskin and furs, as well as specially
designed skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated. Launching an extensive scientific 
research expedition, he traveled with over three times 
more men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs, 
19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art
motorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled
the storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies, they found both their ponies and 
motor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow. In the spring of 1911, after waiting out
the long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled 
over the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's
earlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been
documented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time
using a previously uncharted route through the same Transantarctic Mountains. They stayed ahead of Scott’s team, and on December 14, arrived first
at their desolate destination. To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded
Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims, Amundsen’s team traversed
the area in a grid to make sure they covered
the Pole’s location. Along with flags and a tent marker, they left a letter for Scott, which would
not be found until over a month later. But when Scott’s party
finally reached the pole, losing the ‘race’ was
the least of their problems.  On the way back towards the camp,
two of the five men succumbed to frostbite starvation, and exhaustion. The remaining explorers hoped for a
prearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base, but due to a series of mishaps, 
misjudgements and miscommunications, their rescue never arrived. Their remains, along with Scott’s diary,
would not be found until spring. Today, scientists from various countries live and work at Antarctic 
research stations. But the journeys of these early
explorers are not forgotten. Despite their divergent fates,
they are forever joined in history, and in the name of the research
base that marks the South Pole.

**Transcript**:
Roald Amundsen had spent nearly two
years preparing his Arctic expedition. He had secured funding from the Norwegian
Crown and hand-picked a trusted crew. He’d even received the blessing of
the famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen, along with the use of his ship, Fram, 
specially constructed to withstand the ice. Now, with the voyage departing, he had 
one final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the
opposite direction. By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had
been visited and mapped, with only two key locations
remaining: the North Pole, deep in the
frozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a
recently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of
reaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers
Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims
to the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to
what he called “the last great problem.” But Amundsen’s crew weren’t 
the only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had
already visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own 
South Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova 
reached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news
that Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted
against the Norwegian in what the newspapers 
called a ‘race to the Pole.’ Yet if it was a race,
it was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times
from different locations, and they had very different 
plans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely
on reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and 
Norwegian experience, arriving with a small team of
men and more than a hundred dogs. His explorers were clothed
in sealskin and furs, as well as specially
designed skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated. Launching an extensive scientific 
research expedition, he traveled with over three times 
more men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs, 
19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art
motorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled
the storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies, they found both their ponies and 
motor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow. In the spring of 1911, after waiting out
the long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled 
over the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's
earlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been
documented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time

**Transcript**:
Roald Amundsen had spent nearly two
years preparing his Arctic expedition. He had secured funding from the Norwegian
Crown and hand-picked a trusted crew. He’d even received the blessing of
the famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen, along with the use of his ship, Fram, 
specially constructed to withstand the ice. Now, with the voyage departing, he had 
one final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the
opposite direction. By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had
been visited and mapped, with only two key locations
remaining: the North Pole, deep in the
frozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a
recently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of
reaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers
Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims
to the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to
what he called “the last great problem.” But Amundsen’s crew weren’t 
the only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had
already visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own 
South Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova 
reached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news
that Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted
against the Norwegian in what the newspapers 
called a ‘race to the Pole.’ Yet if it was a race,
it was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times
from different locations, and they had very different 
plans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely
on reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and 
Norwegian experience, arriving with a small team of
men and more than a hundred dogs. His explorers were clothed
in sealskin and furs, as well as specially
designed skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated. Launching an extensive scientific 
research expedition, he traveled with over three times 
more men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs, 
19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art
motorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled
the storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies, they found both their ponies and 
motor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow. In the spring of 1911, after waiting out
the long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled 
over the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's
earlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been
documented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time
using a previously uncharted route through the same Transantarctic Mountains. They stayed ahead of Scott’s team, and on December 14, arrived first
at their desolate destination. To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded
Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims, Amundsen’s team traversed
the area in a grid to make sure they covered
the Pole’s location. Along with flags and a tent marker, they left a letter for Scott, which would
not be found until over a month later. But when Scott’s party
finally reached the pole, losing the ‘race’ was
the least of their problems.  On the way back towards the camp,
two of the five men succumbed to frostbite starvation, and exhaustion. The remaining explorers hoped for a
prearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base, but due to a series of mishaps, 
misjudgements and miscommunications, their rescue never arrived. Their remains, along with Scott’s diary,
would not be found until spring. Today, scientists from various countries live and work at Antarctic 
research stations. But the journeys of these early
explorers are not forgotten. Despite their divergent fates,
they are forever joined in history, and in the name of the research
base that marks the South Pole.

**Transcript**:
Your internship in Professor Ramsey’s
physics lab has been amazing. Until, that is, the professor accidentally
stepped through a time portal. You’ve got just a minute to jump through
the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history. Once you’re through it, 
the portal will close, and your only way back will be 
to create a new one using the chrono-nodules from your lab. Activated nodules connect to each other via red or blue tachyon entanglement. Activate more nodules and they’ll connect to all other nodules in the area. As soon as a red or blue triangle is
created with a nodule at each point, it opens a doorway through time that
will take you back to the present. But the color of each individual
connection manifests at random, and there’s no way to choose
or change its color. And there’s one more problem: each individual nodule creates a
temporal instability that raises the chances the portal
might collapse as you go through it. So the fewer you bring, the better. The portal’s about to close. What’s the minimum number of nodules 
you need to bring to be certain you’ll create a red or 
blue triangle and get back to the present? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This question is so rich that an entire
branch of mathematics known as Ramsey Theory developed from it. Ramsey Theory is home to some
famously difficult problems. This one isn’t easy, but it can be handled if you approach it systematically. Imagine you brought just three nodules. Would that be enough? No - for example,
you might have two blue and one red connection,
and be stuck in the past forever. Would four nodules be enough?
No - there are many arrangements here that don’t give a blue or red triangle. What about five? It turns out there is an arrangement of
connections that avoids creating 
a blue or red triangle. These smaller triangles don’t count because
they don’t have a nodule at each corner. However, six nodules will always create a
blue triangle or a red triangle. Here’s how we can prove that without
sorting through every possible case. Imagine activating the sixth nodule, and consider how it might connect
to the other five. It could do so in one of six ways: with five red connections, five blue
connections, or some mix of red and blue. Notice that every possibility has at least
three connections of the same color coming from this nodule. Let’s look at just the nodules
on the other end of those same three color connections. If the connections were blue, then any additional blue connection between
those three would give us a blue triangle. So the only way we could get in trouble is if all the connections
between them were red. But those three red connections
would give us a red triangle. No matter what happens,
we’ll get a red or a blue triangle, and open our doorway.  On the other hand, if the original three connections 
were all red instead of blue, the same argument still works, 
with all the colors flipped. In other words, no matter how the
connections are colored, six nodules will always create a red or 
blue triangle and a doorway leading home. So you grab six nodules and jump through
the portal. You were hoping your internship would
give you valuable life experience. Turns out, that didn’t take much time.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the colors of the connections between chrono-nodules, which is a specific detail mentioned in the transcript. Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 is the closest in terms of relevance to the ground truth MCQ, as it mentions the purpose of the chrono-nodules, which includes connecting to each other via red or blue tachyon entanglement.

However, it's essential to note that Question 8 does not directly address the randomness of the connection colors, which is the primary focus of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would suggest Question 8, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Your internship in Professor Ramsey’s
physics lab has been amazing. Until, that is, the professor accidentally
stepped through a time portal. You’ve got just a minute to jump through
the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history. Once you’re through it, 
the portal will close, and your only way back will be 
to create a new one using the chrono-nodules from your lab. Activated nodules connect to each other via red or blue tachyon entanglement. Activate more nodules and they’ll connect to all other nodules in the area. As soon as a red or blue triangle is
created with a nodule at each point, it opens a doorway through time that
will take you back to the present. But the color of each individual
connection manifests at random, and there’s no way to choose
or change its color. And there’s one more problem: each individual nodule creates a
temporal instability that raises the chances the portal
might collapse as you go through it. So the fewer you bring, the better. The portal’s about to close. What’s the minimum number of nodules 
you need to bring to be certain you’ll create a red or 
blue triangle and get back to the present? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This question is so rich that an entire
branch of mathematics known as Ramsey Theory developed from it. Ramsey Theory is home to some
famously difficult problems. This one isn’t easy, but it can be handled if you approach it systematically. Imagine you brought just three nodules. Would that be enough? No - for example,
you might have two blue and one red connection,
and be stuck in the past forever. Would four nodules be enough?
No - there are many arrangements here that don’t give a blue or red triangle. What about five? It turns out there is an arrangement of
connections that avoids creating 
a blue or red triangle. These smaller triangles don’t count because
they don’t have a nodule at each corner. However, six nodules will always create a
blue triangle or a red triangle. Here’s how we can prove that without
sorting through every possible case. Imagine activating the sixth nodule, and consider how it might connect
to the other five. It could do so in one of six ways: with five red connections, five blue
connections, or some mix of red and blue. Notice that every possibility has at least
three connections of the same color coming from this nodule. Let’s look at just the nodules
on the other end of those same three color connections. If the connections were blue, then any additional blue connection between
those three would give us a blue triangle. So the only way we could get in trouble is if all the connections
between them were red. But those three red connections
would give us a red triangle. No matter what happens,
we’ll get a red or a blue triangle, and open our doorway.  On the other hand, if the original three connections 
were all red instead of blue, the same argument still works, 
with all the colors flipped. In other words, no matter how the
connections are colored, six nodules will always create a red or 
blue triangle and a doorway leading home. So you grab six nodules and jump through
the portal. You were hoping your internship would
give you valuable life experience. Turns out, that didn’t take much time.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the wording of the question is different, the intent and content of Question 8 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks what opens a time portal, and the correct answer is a red or blue triangle with chrono-nodules at the corners. Question 8 asks about the purpose of the chrono-nodules, and one of the correct purposes is to create a doorway through time (which is equivalent to opening a time portal). However, it's worth noting that Question 8 is not an exact match, as it does not specifically ask about the triangle configuration.

**Transcript**:
a group of youths sneak into the woods, where they take mind-altering substances, switch it up romantically, and brush up against creatures 
from another dimension. "A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream" sees 
Shakespeare get psychedelic – and the result is a treat in the 
theatre and on the page. First performed in the 1590's, this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works, filled with trickery, madness and magic. Set over the course of one night, Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace. The plot is structured around patterns of 
collision and dissolution, where characters from different worlds 
are thrown together and torn apart. Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock 
the characters’ self-obsession and question authority with a comic twist. The action is set in Ancient Greece, but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns. The magical setting of the woods at night disrupts the boundaries between 
separate groups, with bizarre results. Here, the bard plays with the rigid class 
system of his own time, taking three distinct groups
and turning their society upside-down in a world where no mortal is in control. The play opens with young Hermia raging at her father Egeus and 
Theseus, the King of Athens, who have forbidden her to marry 
her lover Lysander. Hermia has no interest in her father's 
choice for her of Demetrius – but her best friend Helena 
definitely does. Furious at their elders, Hermia and 
Lysander elope under cover of darkness, with Demetrius in hot pursuit. This is further complicated 
by Helena’s decision to follow them all into the woods,
in the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart. At this point, the woods are 
getting crowded, as the lovers are sharing the space 
with a group of “rude mechanicals”— a troupe of workers drunkenly rehearsing 
a play, led by the jovial Nick Bottom. Unbeknownst to them, the humans have 
entered into the world of the fairies. Despite their magical splendor, 
Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies, 
have their own romantic problems. Furious at his inability to control 
Titania, the jealous Oberon commands the trickster Puck to squeeze the
juice of a magical flower over her eyes. When she wakes up, she’ll fall in love 
with the first thing she sees. On his mission, Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over
the eyes of the napping Demetrius and Lysander, and transforms Bottom’s head
into that of a donkey for good measure. As eyes flicker open, a night of chaos commences that includes
broken hearts, mistaken identity, and transformations. Out of all the characters, Bottom probably
fares the best – when the bewitched Titania 
lays eyes on him, she calls on her fairies to lavish him 
with wine and treasures and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman 
off his feet: “pluck the wings from painted butterflies/ To fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes. Nod to him, elves, 
and do him courtesies.” While magic is the catalyst to the action, the play reflects the real drama 
of the things we do for love – and the nonsensical behavior 
of the people under its spell. The moon overlooks the action 
“like a silver bow,” signifying erratic behavior, 
the dark side of love, and the bewitching allure of a world 
where the usual rules don’t apply. Although the characters eventually 
come to their senses, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" 
raises the question of how much agency we have 
over our own daily lives. But it’s not the more realistically
rendered lovers, rulers or workers who have the last word, but the impish Puck who queries whether we
can ever truly trust what we see: If we shadows have offended, Think but this and all is mended: That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear.  And in so doing, he evokes the effect of entering into the 
magical world of great theatre that plays with the boundary between 
illusion and reality – and dramatizes the possibility 
that life is but a dream.

**Transcript**:
a group of youths sneak into the woods, where they take mind-altering substances, switch it up romantically, and brush up against creatures 
from another dimension. "A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream" sees 
Shakespeare get psychedelic – and the result is a treat in the 
theatre and on the page. First performed in the 1590's, this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works, filled with trickery, madness and magic. Set over the course of one night, Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace. The plot is structured around patterns of 
collision and dissolution, where characters from different worlds 
are thrown together and torn apart. Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock 
the characters’ self-obsession and question authority with a comic twist. The action is set in Ancient Greece, but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns. The magical setting of the woods at night disrupts the boundaries between 
separate groups, with bizarre results. Here, the bard plays with the rigid class 
system of his own time, taking three distinct groups
and turning their society upside-down in a world where no mortal is in control. The play opens with young Hermia raging at her father Egeus and 
Theseus, the King of Athens, who have forbidden her to marry 
her lover Lysander. Hermia has no interest in her father's 
choice for her of Demetrius – but her best friend Helena 
definitely does. Furious at their elders, Hermia and 
Lysander elope under cover of darkness, with Demetrius in hot pursuit. This is further complicated 
by Helena’s decision to follow them all into the woods,
in the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart. At this point, the woods are 
getting crowded, as the lovers are sharing the space 
with a group of “rude mechanicals”— a troupe of workers drunkenly rehearsing 
a play, led by the jovial Nick Bottom. Unbeknownst to them, the humans have 
entered into the world of the fairies. Despite their magical splendor, 
Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies, 
have their own romantic problems. Furious at his inability to control 
Titania, the jealous Oberon commands the trickster Puck to squeeze the
juice of a magical flower over her eyes. When she wakes up, she’ll fall in love 
with the first thing she sees. On his mission, Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over
the eyes of the napping Demetrius and Lysander, and transforms Bottom’s head
into that of a donkey for good measure. As eyes flicker open, a night of chaos commences that includes
broken hearts, mistaken identity, and transformations. Out of all the characters, Bottom probably
fares the best – when the bewitched Titania 
lays eyes on him, she calls on her fairies to lavish him 
with wine and treasures and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman 
off his feet: “pluck the wings from painted butterflies/ To fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes. Nod to him, elves, 
and do him courtesies.” While magic is the catalyst to the action, the play reflects the real drama 
of the things we do for love – and the nonsensical behavior 
of the people under its spell. The moon overlooks the action 
“like a silver bow,” signifying erratic behavior, 
the dark side of love, and the bewitching allure of a world 
where the usual rules don’t apply. Although the characters eventually 
come to their senses, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" 
raises the question of how much agency we have 
over our own daily lives. But it’s not the more realistically
rendered lovers, rulers or workers who have the last word, but the impish Puck who queries whether we
can ever truly trust what we see: If we shadows have offended, Think but this and all is mended: That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear.  And in so doing, he evokes the effect of entering into the 
magical world of great theatre that plays with the boundary between 
illusion and reality – and dramatizes the possibility 
that life is but a dream.

**Transcript**:
Billy Pilgrim can’t sleep because he knows aliens will arrive
to abduct him in one hour. He knows the aliens are coming because
he has become “unstuck” in time, causing him to experience
events out of chronological order. Over the course of Kurt Vonnegut’s 
Slaughterhouse-five, he hops back and forth between a childhood
trip to the Grand Canyon, his life as a middle-aged optometrist, his captivity in an intergalactic zoo, the humiliations he endured
as a war prisoner, and more. The title of Slaughterhouse-five and 
much of its source material came from Vonnegut’s own 
experiences in World War II. As a prisoner of war, he lived in a former
slaughterhouse in Dresden, where he took refuge in an 
underground meat locker while Allied forces bombed the city. When he and the other prisoners
finally emerged, they found Dresden utterly demolished. After the war, Vonnegut tried to 
make sense of human behavior by studying an unusual 
aspect of anthropology: the shapes of stories, which he insisted were just as interesting
as the shapes of pots or spearheads. To find the shape, he graphed the main 
character’s fortune from the beginning to the end of a story. The zany curves he generated revealed 
common types of fairy tales and myths that echo through many cultures. But this shape can be
the most interesting of all. In a story like this, it’s impossible to distinguish the 
character’s good fortune from the bad. Vonnegut thought this kind of story 
was the truest to real life, in which we are all the victims 
of a series of accidents, unable to predict how events 
will impact us long term. He found the tidy, satisfying arcs of 
many stories at odds with this reality, and he set out to explore the ambiguity between good and bad fortune
in his own work. When Vonnegut ditched clear-cut fortunes, he also abandoned
straightforward chronology. Instead of proceeding tidily from 
beginning to end, in his stories “All moments, past, present and future 
always have existed, always will exist.” Tralfamadorians, the aliens who crop up
in many of his books, see all moments at once. They “can see where each star has been
and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled
with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.” But although they can see all of time, they don’t try to change 
the course of events. While the Trafalmadorians may be at peace 
with their lack of agency, Vonnegut’s human characters are 
still getting used to it. In The Sirens of Titan, when they seek the meaning of life
in the vastness of the universe, they find nothing but “empty heroics, 
low comedy, and pointless death.” Then, from their vantage point within 
a “chrono-synclastic infundibulum,” a man and his dog see devastating 
futures for their earthly counterparts, but can’t change the course of events. Though there aren’t easy answers 
available, they eventually conclude that the purpose of life is “to love
whoever is around to be loved.” In Cat’s Cradle, Vonnegut’s characters 
turn to a different source of meaning: Bokonism, a religion based on harmless lies 
that all its adherents recognize as lies. Though they’re aware of Bokonism’s lies, they live their lives by 
these tenets anyway, and in so doing develop
some genuine hope. They join together in groups called 
Karasses, which consist of people we “find by accident but […] 
stick with by choice”— cosmically linked around
a shared purpose. These are not to be confused 
with Granfalloons, groups of people who appoint significance
to actually meaningless associations, like where you grew up, political 
parties, and even entire nations. Though he held a bleak view of the human 
condition, Vonnegut believed strongly that “we are all here to help each other get
through this thing, whatever it is." We might get pooped and demoralized, but Vonnegut interspersed 
his grim assessments with more than a few morsels of hope. His fictional alter ego, Kilgore Trout, 
supplied this parable: two yeast sat “discussing the
possible purposes of life as they ate sugar and suffocated 
in their own excrement. Because of their limited intelligence, they never came close to guessing 
that they were making champagne.” In spite of his insistence that we’re
all here to fart around, in spite of his deep concerns about 
the course of human existence, Vonnegut also advanced the possibility, 
however slim, that we might end up 
making something good. And if that isn’t nice, what is?

**Transcript**:
Billy Pilgrim can’t sleep because he knows aliens will arrive
to abduct him in one hour. He knows the aliens are coming because
he has become “unstuck” in time, causing him to experience
events out of chronological order. Over the course of Kurt Vonnegut’s 
Slaughterhouse-five, he hops back and forth between a childhood
trip to the Grand Canyon, his life as a middle-aged optometrist, his captivity in an intergalactic zoo, the humiliations he endured
as a war prisoner, and more. The title of Slaughterhouse-five and 
much of its source material came from Vonnegut’s own 
experiences in World War II. As a prisoner of war, he lived in a former
slaughterhouse in Dresden, where he took refuge in an 
underground meat locker while Allied forces bombed the city. When he and the other prisoners
finally emerged, they found Dresden utterly demolished. After the war, Vonnegut tried to 
make sense of human behavior by studying an unusual 
aspect of anthropology: the shapes of stories, which he insisted were just as interesting
as the shapes of pots or spearheads. To find the shape, he graphed the main 
character’s fortune from the beginning to the end of a story. The zany curves he generated revealed 
common types of fairy tales and myths that echo through many cultures. But this shape can be
the most interesting of all. In a story like this, it’s impossible to distinguish the 
character’s good fortune from the bad. Vonnegut thought this kind of story 
was the truest to real life, in which we are all the victims 
of a series of accidents, unable to predict how events 
will impact us long term. He found the tidy, satisfying arcs of 
many stories at odds with this reality, and he set out to explore the ambiguity between good and bad fortune
in his own work. When Vonnegut ditched clear-cut fortunes, he also abandoned
straightforward chronology. Instead of proceeding tidily from 
beginning to end, in his stories “All moments, past, present and future 
always have existed, always will exist.” Tralfamadorians, the aliens who crop up
in many of his books, see all moments at once. They “can see where each star has been
and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled
with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.” But although they can see all of time, they don’t try to change 
the course of events. While the Trafalmadorians may be at peace 
with their lack of agency, Vonnegut’s human characters are 
still getting used to it. In The Sirens of Titan, when they seek the meaning of life
in the vastness of the universe, they find nothing but “empty heroics, 
low comedy, and pointless death.” Then, from their vantage point within 
a “chrono-synclastic infundibulum,” a man and his dog see devastating 
futures for their earthly counterparts, but can’t change the course of events. Though there aren’t easy answers 
available, they eventually conclude that the purpose of life is “to love
whoever is around to be loved.” In Cat’s Cradle, Vonnegut’s characters 
turn to a different source of meaning: Bokonism, a religion based on harmless lies 
that all its adherents recognize as lies. Though they’re aware of Bokonism’s lies, they live their lives by 
these tenets anyway, and in so doing develop
some genuine hope. They join together in groups called 
Karasses, which consist of people we “find by accident but […] 
stick with by choice”— cosmically linked around
a shared purpose. These are not to be confused 
with Granfalloons, groups of people who appoint significance
to actually meaningless associations, like where you grew up, political 
parties, and even entire nations. Though he held a bleak view of the human 
condition, Vonnegut believed strongly that “we are all here to help each other get
through this thing, whatever it is." We might get pooped and demoralized, but Vonnegut interspersed 
his grim assessments with more than a few morsels of hope. His fictional alter ego, Kilgore Trout, 
supplied this parable: two yeast sat “discussing the
possible purposes of life as they ate sugar and suffocated 
in their own excrement. Because of their limited intelligence, they never came close to guessing 
that they were making champagne.” In spite of his insistence that we’re
all here to fart around, in spite of his deep concerns about 
the course of human existence, Vonnegut also advanced the possibility, 
however slim, that we might end up 
making something good. And if that isn’t nice, what is?

**Transcript**:
The family of giants you work for is throwing a fancy dinner party, and they all want to look their best. But there’s a problem – the elder giant’s favorite 
shirt is wrinkled! To fix it, you’ll need to power up… the Giant Iron. The iron needs two giant 
batteries to work. You just had 4 working ones and 4 dead ones in separate piles, but it looks like the baby giant 
mixed them all up. You need to get the iron working 
and press the giant shirt, fast – or you’ll end up being the 
main course tonight! How can you test the batteries so that you’re guaranteed to get 
a working pair in 7 tries or less? Pause the video now if you want to 
figure it out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could, of course, take 
all eight batteries and begin testing the 28 
possible combinations. You might get lucky within 
the first few tries. But if you don’t, moving the giant 
batteries that many times will take way too long. You can’t rely on luck – you need to assume the worst 
possibility and plan accordingly. However, you don’t actually need 
to test every possible combination. Remember – there are four 
good batteries in total, meaning that any pile of six you choose will have at least two 
good batteries in it. That doesn’t help you right away, since testing all six batteries could 
still take as many as 15 tries. But it does give you 
a clue to the solution – dividing the batteries into smaller 
subsets narrows down the possible results. So instead of six batteries, let’s take any three. This group has a total of three 
possible combinations. Since both batteries have to be 
working for the iron to power up, a single failure can’t tell you whether 
both batteries are dead, or just one. But if all three combinations fail, then you’ll know this group has either 
one good battery, or none at all. Now you can set those three aside and repeat the process for 
another three batteries. You might get a match, but if every 
combination fails again, you’ll know this set can have 
no more than one good battery. That would leave only two 
batteries untried. Since there are four good 
batteries in total and you’ve only accounted for two so far, both of these remaining ones must be good. Dividing the batteries into 
sets of 3, 3, and 2 is guaranteed to get a working result 
in 7 tries or less, no matter what order 
you test the piles in. With no time to spare, 
the iron comes to life, and you manage to get the shirt 
flawlessly ironed. The pleased elder and his family show up 
to the party dressed to the nines … well, almost.

**Transcript**:
The family of giants you work for is throwing a fancy dinner party, and they all want to look their best. But there’s a problem – the elder giant’s favorite 
shirt is wrinkled! To fix it, you’ll need to power up… the Giant Iron. The iron needs two giant 
batteries to work. You just had 4 working ones and 4 dead ones in separate piles, but it looks like the baby giant 
mixed them all up. You need to get the iron working 
and press the giant shirt, fast – or you’ll end up being the 
main course tonight! How can you test the batteries so that you’re guaranteed to get 
a working pair in 7 tries or less? Pause the video now if you want to 
figure it out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could, of course, take 
all eight batteries and begin testing the 28 
possible combinations. You might get lucky within 
the first few tries. But if you don’t, moving the giant 
batteries that many times will take way too long. You can’t rely on luck – you need to assume the worst 
possibility and plan accordingly. However, you don’t actually need 
to test every possible combination. Remember – there are four 
good batteries in total, meaning that any pile of six you choose will have at least two 
good batteries in it. That doesn’t help you right away, since testing all six batteries could 
still take as many as 15 tries. But it does give you 
a clue to the solution – dividing the batteries into smaller 
subsets narrows down the possible results. So instead of six batteries, let’s take any three. This group has a total of three 
possible combinations. Since both batteries have to be 
working for the iron to power up, a single failure can’t tell you whether 
both batteries are dead, or just one. But if all three combinations fail, then you’ll know this group has either 
one good battery, or none at all. Now you can set those three aside and repeat the process for 
another three batteries. You might get a match, but if every 
combination fails again, you’ll know this set can have 
no more than one good battery. That would leave only two 
batteries untried. Since there are four good 
batteries in total and you’ve only accounted for two so far, both of these remaining ones must be good. Dividing the batteries into 
sets of 3, 3, and 2 is guaranteed to get a working result 
in 7 tries or less, no matter what order 
you test the piles in. With no time to spare, 
the iron comes to life, and you manage to get the shirt 
flawlessly ironed. The pleased elder and his family show up 
to the party dressed to the nines … well, almost.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What is the guaranteed outcome when dividing the batteries into sets of 3, 3, and 2? 

Although the wording of Question 6 is different from the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of combinations needed to try, given the optimal solution, and the correct answer is "No more than 7." Question 6 asks about the guaranteed outcome of the optimal solution (dividing the batteries into sets of 3, 3, and 2) and implies that the solution can be achieved in a limited number of tries (as explained in the transcript, this would be no more than 7 tries).

However, an even more similar question is missing. If we have to choose from the existing questions, Question 6 is the closest match.

[PBS BUMPER] There’s about 7.4 billion people on Earth
today ...and over 200 million dogs. So exactly where, when, and why did warm-hearted
wolves join our pack? And who trained who? [OPEN] So… Cat person? Or dog person? Me? I’m totally impartial. No matter where you sit – siiiiiiit, it’s
plain to see that the histories of dogs and humans are intertwined… maybe like no other
two species. If we take domestication out of the human
equation, it’s estimated just 1 or 2 million of us would be around today. And of all those animal alliances, our relationship
with dogs is the oldest. But figuring out why, where, and when domestic
dogs first originated is still a bone of contention. Why? Is the easiest to answer. Every continent is home to wild canids – like
Africa’s painted dogs or Asia’s doles, but thanks to genetic research we know modern
pups didn’t descend from those local species. Today’s domestic dogs all trace their
DNA back to ancient wolves. You may have heard that wolves and ancient
people were hunting buddies that used teamwork to run down bigger prey. That’s a nice story, but wolf packs can
hunt just fine on their own – and usually aren’t too big on sharing. Plus, early humans tended to kill off most
carnivorous competition. It’s most likely that humans didn’t adopt
dogs. Dogs adopted us. Any “wolves gone mild” that were tolerant
of humans could have scrounged our scraps. They didn’t need us, but our leftovers could
have made their lives easier. Today, about 85 percent of domestic dogs still
survive on our waste - no matter how many times we tell them “STAY OUT OF THE TRASH” But a tame wolf isn’t a dog, and scientists
are still trying to figure out when and where that change occurred. Studying living wolves tells us the line that
led to our pups is extinct today, but we can still find their footprints in modern dog
genomes. Looking at DNA in mitochondria tells us dogs
split from their wolf ancestors somewhere in Europe between 19 and 32 thousand years
ago, but whole genomes from dozens of living dogs put the split somewhere in South Asia
around 33,000 years ago. It’s tough to pin down because dog genes
have mixed so much. Fossils don’t tell the whole story either,
because bones alone can’t tell us when the thing that looked like a wolf started to act
like a dog. But combining the two, fossils and DNA, could give us some hints. DNA extracted from ancient dog fossils has
suggested a new story: the domestication split happened in two places, at least 12,000 years
ago. And then at some point, Eastern dogs followed
people west, and became the dominant ancestor of our canine compadres. Dogs became useful herders, sled pullers,
and guards – against predators AND neighboring human tribes. And in a pinch, they could have served as
an emergency food supply. Dogs probably saved us more times than we
can count. We’re paying them back – pups now have
access to insurance, healthcare, some even have more instagram followers than you and
me. From a wolf mold, we’ve crafted 340 or so
dog breeds, even a few weird ones. It’s hard to believe every domestic dog
is still part of the same species, one whose story is so tightly wound to our own, that
we still can’t quite tell where it begins. Stay! Staaaay. Curious.

This question mentions "wolf ancestors" which is similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, it does not directly ask about the ancestry of modern dogs.

A question that directly asks about the ancestry of modern dogs is not present in the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose the most similar question, I would choose **Question 5**.

However, since it's not a direct match I will keep looking for a match.

After re-reading the questions I have identified a better match.

**Question 11: According to the transcript, in which time period did the domestication split between dogs and wolves occur in Europe? Options: A. 19-32 thousand years ago, B. 33 thousand years ago, C. 12 thousand years ago, D. 40 thousand years ago Correct Option: A** and 

**Question 3: In which continent is it estimated that the domestication split between dogs and wolves occurred around 33,000 years ago? Options: A. Europe, B. Asia, C. Africa, D. South America Correct Option: B**

Both these questions have relevant information about the time period and location of the domestication split between dogs and wolves.

However, the question that comes closest to asking about the ancestry of modern dogs is:

**Question 2: According to the transcript, what is the reason why humans didn't domesticate dogs, but rather the other way around? Options: A. Humans and dogs formed a symbiotic relationship, B. Humans and dogs formed a partnership for hunting, C. Dogs adopted humans and scavenged human leftovers, D. Dogs were domesticated for their milk and wool Correct Option: C**

The transcript part related to this question is: "Thanks to genetic research we know modern pups didn’t descend from those local species. Today’s domestic dogs all trace their DNA back to ancient wolves."

This part of the transcript is very similar to the ground truth MCQ. Therefore, I will choose **Question 2**'s related question (the one that would be its pair) if it existed, but since it does not I will choose the closest match to the ground truth MCQ which is:

None of the questions is an exact match. However, if I had to choose I would say **Question 2** is the closest to having the relevant information to answer the ground truth MCQ.

Since it is not a direct match I will keep **Question 2**'s index as a potential answer but I will also keep looking.

After another review of the questions I did not find a better match.

Since I did not find a better match I will choose **Question 2**'s index as my answer.

**Transcript**:
About once every century, a massive star somewhere in our galaxy runs out of fuel. This happens after millions of years 
of heat and pressure have fused the star’s hydrogen into heavier elements like helium,
carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron. No longer able to produce sufficient 
energy to maintain its structure, it collapses under its own gravitational 
pressure and explodes in a supernova. The star shoots most of its 
innards into space, seeding the galaxy with heavy elements. But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves
behind might be even more remarkable: a ball of matter so dense that 
atomic electrons collapse from their quantum orbits 
into the depths of atomic nuclei. The death of that star 
is the birth of a neutron star: one of the densest known objects 
in the universe, and a laboratory for the strange physics 
of supercondensed matter. But what is a neutron star? Think of a compact ball inside of which 
protons and electrons fuse into neutrons and form a frictionless liquid 
called a superfluid— surrounded by a crust. This material is incredibly dense – the equivalent of the mass of a 
fully-loaded container ship squeezed into a human hair, or the mass of Mount Everest 
in a space of a sugar cube. Deeper in the crust, the neutron 
superfluid forms different phases that physicists call “nuclear pasta,” as it’s squeezed from lasagna 
to spaghetti-like shapes. The massive precursors to 
neutron stars often spin. When they collapse, stars that are typically millions of 
kilometers wide compress down to neutron stars that are
only about 25 kilometers across. But the original star’s angular 
momentum is preserved. So for the same reason that a figure 
skater’s spin accelerates when they bring in their arms, the neutron star spins much more 
rapidly than its parent. The fastest neutron star on record 
rotates over 700 times every second, which means that a point on its surface 
whirls through space at more than a fifth 
of the speed of light. Neutron stars also have the strongest 
magnetic field of any known object. This magnetic concentration
forms vortexes that radiate beams 
from the magnetic poles. Since the poles aren’t always aligned 
with the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink 
when viewed from Earth. We call those pulsars. The detection of one of these 
tantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly
discovered neutron stars in the first place. An aging neutron star’s furious rotation
slows over a period of billions of years as it radiates away its energy in the form
of electromagnetic and gravity waves. But not all neutron stars 
disappear so quietly. For example, we’ve observed binary systems where a neutron star 
co-orbits another star. A neutron star can feed on 
a lighter companion, gorging on its more 
loosely bound atmosphere before eventually collapsing
cataclysmically into a black hole. While many stars exist as binary systems, only a small percentage of those end up 
as neutron-star binaries, where two neutron stars circle each other 
in a waltz doomed to end as a merger. When they finally collide, they send 
gravity waves through space-time like ripples from a stone 
thrown into a calm lake. Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted this phenomenon over 100 years
ago, but it wasn't directly verified until 2017, when gravitational-wave observatories 
LIGO and VIRGO observed a neutron star collision. Other telescopes picked up a burst of 
gamma rays and a flash of light, and, later, x-rays and radio signals, 
all from the same impact. That became the most studied event 
in the history of astronomy. It yielded a treasure trove of data that’s helped pin down the speed 
of gravity, bolster important theories 
in astrophysics, and provide evidence for the origin 
of heavy elements like gold and platinum. Neutron stars haven’t given up 
all their secrets yet. LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded 
to detect more collisions. That’ll help us learn what else the spectacular demise of these dense, 
pulsating, spinning magnets can tell us about the universe.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the outcome of a massive star after a million years. The correct answer is that it explodes.

Among the generated MCQs, the one that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. Although it doesn't exactly ask the same question, it does relate to the collapse and explosion of a massive star.

However, a more relevant question would be one that directly addresses the outcome of a massive star after a certain period. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match, as it discusses the collapse and explosion of a massive star.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
About once every century, a massive star somewhere in our galaxy runs out of fuel. This happens after millions of years 
of heat and pressure have fused the star’s hydrogen into heavier elements like helium,
carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron. No longer able to produce sufficient 
energy to maintain its structure, it collapses under its own gravitational 
pressure and explodes in a supernova. The star shoots most of its 
innards into space, seeding the galaxy with heavy elements. But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves
behind might be even more remarkable: a ball of matter so dense that 
atomic electrons collapse from their quantum orbits 
into the depths of atomic nuclei. The death of that star 
is the birth of a neutron star: one of the densest known objects 
in the universe, and a laboratory for the strange physics 
of supercondensed matter. But what is a neutron star? Think of a compact ball inside of which 
protons and electrons fuse into neutrons and form a frictionless liquid 
called a superfluid— surrounded by a crust. This material is incredibly dense – the equivalent of the mass of a 
fully-loaded container ship squeezed into a human hair, or the mass of Mount Everest 
in a space of a sugar cube. Deeper in the crust, the neutron 
superfluid forms different phases that physicists call “nuclear pasta,” as it’s squeezed from lasagna 
to spaghetti-like shapes. The massive precursors to 
neutron stars often spin. When they collapse, stars that are typically millions of 
kilometers wide compress down to neutron stars that are
only about 25 kilometers across. But the original star’s angular 
momentum is preserved. So for the same reason that a figure 
skater’s spin accelerates when they bring in their arms, the neutron star spins much more 
rapidly than its parent. The fastest neutron star on record 
rotates over 700 times every second, which means that a point on its surface 
whirls through space at more than a fifth 
of the speed of light. Neutron stars also have the strongest 
magnetic field of any known object. This magnetic concentration
forms vortexes that radiate beams 
from the magnetic poles. Since the poles aren’t always aligned 
with the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink 
when viewed from Earth. We call those pulsars. The detection of one of these 
tantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly
discovered neutron stars in the first place. An aging neutron star’s furious rotation
slows over a period of billions of years as it radiates away its energy in the form
of electromagnetic and gravity waves. But not all neutron stars 
disappear so quietly. For example, we’ve observed binary systems where a neutron star 
co-orbits another star. A neutron star can feed on 
a lighter companion, gorging on its more 
loosely bound atmosphere before eventually collapsing
cataclysmically into a black hole. While many stars exist as binary systems, only a small percentage of those end up 
as neutron-star binaries, where two neutron stars circle each other 
in a waltz doomed to end as a merger. When they finally collide, they send 
gravity waves through space-time like ripples from a stone 
thrown into a calm lake. Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted this phenomenon over 100 years
ago, but it wasn't directly verified until 2017, when gravitational-wave observatories 
LIGO and VIRGO observed a neutron star collision. Other telescopes picked up a burst of 
gamma rays and a flash of light, and, later, x-rays and radio signals, 
all from the same impact. That became the most studied event 
in the history of astronomy. It yielded a treasure trove of data that’s helped pin down the speed 
of gravity, bolster important theories 
in astrophysics, and provide evidence for the origin 
of heavy elements like gold and platinum. Neutron stars haven’t given up 
all their secrets yet. LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded 
to detect more collisions. That’ll help us learn what else the spectacular demise of these dense, 
pulsating, spinning magnets can tell us about the universe.

**Transcript**:
As dawn breaks over a moveable city 
of ten thousand yurts, Queen Boraqchin is in 
for a rude awakening. A rogue sheep has slipped past her 
servants and guards and bolted into her yurt, where he springs into bed 
and bleats in her ear. Although she’s the formidable khatun 
of the Golden Horde, a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire, Boraqchin has a hands-on 
approach to ruling. She’s been married to Batu Khan, the fearsome grandson 
of Genghis Khan himself, since she was fifteen – and while her husband is out on his raids, she juggles the duties of flocks, 
family and empire at home. This makes her the manager – 
and the mover – of a city of thousands. Twice a year, Boraqchin moves the city 
between two seasonal camping grounds. This ensures constant water 
and lush grass in summer, and protection from harsh winds in winter. The whole operation requires 
weeks of strict planning, liaising with the other camps in her 
domain, strategic delegation – and the patience to move at the speed 
of dawdling animals. Today is moving day, and she’ll have to direct throngs of her
ladies, commanders, slaves and animals up the river Volga for the summer. As Boraqchin steps outside, she’s greeted by a commotion – her unwanted visitor is now running 
circles around her stewards. They’re attempting to stow her possessions
securely into wagons. Boraqchin orders them 
to get it under control – but she’s the only one quick 
enough to catch the stray. She next supervises her ladies who are
unpinning her yurt and lifting it onto its custom wagon. It requires a team of twenty oxen to pull, and Boraqchin wouldn’t trust anyone 
to steer it but herself. Next, Boraqchin and her woolly companion 
meet with the guards. She orders them to keep close watch
on her husband's special reception yurt and port-able throne during the journey. They’ll also act as outriders, and she tells them how to secure the 
route, surround her for safety – and keep the animals in check. But when the sheep finally breaks free 
and makes for the fields, the guards can barely keep up as it scampers through crowds 
packing up their yurts. Exasperated, Boraqchin rides down 
to the pastures herself. When she gets there, she catches sight of the troublesome sheep
wriggling into the middle of a flock. When she follows him in, he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother. She’s pregnant,
and seems to be in pain. With a start, Boraqchin realizes 
that this ewe’s impending delivery has been forgotten in 
the flurry of moving day. There’s no time to find a shepherd – instead, Boraqchin rolls up her sleeves, 
greases her arm and helps the ewe give birth to two new 
additions to the empire. Leaving the lambs and their mother, Boraqchin dashes back to the camp. Here the final touches have 
been put to packing, and vehicles are starting to line up. This vast procession starts with the queen and two hundred wagons 
filled with her treasures. Next up are the junior wives and crew, then the concubines – and this is only Boraqchin's camp. After this comes the second imperial camp led by another senior wife, then two more camps, also led by wives. Boraqchin has been checking in 
with them for weeks to ensure a smooth departure and orderly queue. But they only make up the 
royal portion of the line – behind them winds 
the entire civilian city, which includes holy men 
with portable chapels and mosques, families, tradesmen, and shepherds. Finally, Boraqchin settles into her wagon. It’ll take weeks to reach 
their destination – but over the course of the journey, she’ll keep everyone expertly in check – from her proud children 
and attentive subjects, to the most meandering sheep 
at the back of line.

of ten thousand yurts, Queen Boraqchin is in 
for a rude awakening. A rogue sheep has slipped past her 
servants and guards and bolted into her yurt, where he springs into bed 
and bleats in her ear. Although she’s the formidable khatun 
of the Golden Horde, a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire, Boraqchin has a hands-on 
approach to ruling. She’s been married to Batu Khan, the fearsome grandson 
of Genghis Khan himself, since she was fifteen – and while her husband is out on his raids, she juggles the duties of flocks, 
family and empire at home. This makes her the manager – 
and the mover – of a city of thousands. Twice a year, Boraqchin moves the city 
between two seasonal camping grounds. This ensures constant water 
and lush grass in summer, and protection from harsh winds in winter. The whole operation requires 
weeks of strict planning, liaising with the other camps in her 
domain, strategic delegation – and the patience to move at the speed 
of dawdling animals. Today is moving day, and she’ll have to direct throngs of her
ladies, commanders, slaves and animals up the river Volga for the summer. As Boraqchin steps outside, she’s greeted by a commotion – her unwanted visitor is now running 
circles around her stewards. They’re attempting to stow her possessions
securely into wagons. Boraqchin orders them 
to get it under control – but she’s the only one quick 
enough to catch the stray. She next supervises her ladies who are
unpinning her yurt and lifting it onto its custom wagon. It requires a team of twenty oxen to pull, and Boraqchin wouldn’t trust anyone 
to steer it but herself. Next, Boraqchin and her woolly companion 
meet with the guards. She orders them to keep close watch
on her husband's special reception yurt and port-able throne during the journey. They’ll also act as outriders, and she tells them how to secure the 
route, surround her for safety – and keep the animals in check. But when the sheep finally breaks free 
and makes for the fields, the guards can barely keep up as it scampers through crowds 
packing up their yurts. Exasperated, Boraqchin rides down 
to the pastures herself. When she gets there, she catches sight of the troublesome sheep
wriggling into the middle of a flock. When she follows him in, he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother. She’s pregnant,
and seems to be in pain. With a start, Boraqchin realizes 
that this ewe’s impending delivery has been forgotten in 
the flurry of moving day. There’s no time to find a shepherd – instead, Boraqchin rolls up her sleeves, 
greases her arm and helps the ewe give birth to two new 
additions to the empire. Leaving the lambs and their mother, Boraqchin dashes back to the camp. Here the final touches have 
been put to packing, and vehicles are starting to line up. This vast procession starts with the queen and two hundred wagons 
filled with her treasures. Next up are the junior wives and crew, then the concubines – and this is only Boraqchin's camp. After this comes the second imperial camp led by another senior wife, then two more camps, also led by wives. Boraqchin has been checking in 
with them for weeks to ensure a smooth departure and orderly queue. But they only make up the 
royal portion of the line – behind them winds 
the entire civilian city, which includes holy men 
with portable chapels and mosques, families, tradesmen, and shepherds. Finally, Boraqchin settles into her wagon. It’ll take weeks to reach 
their destination – but over the course of the journey, she’ll keep everyone expertly in check – from her proud children 
and attentive subjects, to the most meandering sheep 
at the back of line.

**Transcript**:
In 1982, a young nurse was suffering
from severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t work, socialize, or even concentrate well enough
to read the newspaper. One treatment changed everything. After two courses of electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted. She went back to work, then on to graduate
school, where she earned high grades. At first, she talked openly about
her life changing treatment. But as she realized many people had an
extremely negative impression of ECT, she stopped sharing her experience. ECT carried a deep stigma, leftover from a history that bears little
resemblance to the modern procedure. The therapy was first
used in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors administered a
strong electrical current to the brain, causing a whole-body seizure
during which patients might bite their tongues
or even break bones. Modern ECT is very different. While a patient is under 
general anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series
of mild electrical pulses to the brain. This causes huge numbers of neurons
to fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure. A muscle relaxant keeps spasms
from spreading to the rest of his body. The only physical indication of the
electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts for about a minute,
and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an
hour after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases
of major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded
to other therapies, or who have had adverse 
reactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo 
treatment experience an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or
three sessions per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement
in their symptoms after just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less frequent
treatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than
it used to be, but patients can still 
experience side effects. They may feel achy, fatigued, 
or nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble remembering what
happened right before a session— for example, what they had for 
dinner the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble 
remembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory
loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its 
proven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons in the brain communicate via
electrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked
by ECT alters that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release
of certain neurotransmitters, molecules that help carry signals between
neurons and influence mental health. ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones
that may help reduce symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication, even in patients who were
resistant to medication before. As we come to a better 
understanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make 
ECT even more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after
her first course of ECT, the nurse decided to publish an
account of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding
the treatment, she worried that doing so
might negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference
for patients when all else failed. Though misperceptions about ECT persist, accounts like hers have helped make
doctors and patients alike aware of the treatment’s 
life changing potential.

**Transcript**:
In 1982, a young nurse was suffering
from severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t work, socialize, or even concentrate well enough
to read the newspaper. One treatment changed everything. After two courses of electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted. She went back to work, then on to graduate
school, where she earned high grades. At first, she talked openly about
her life changing treatment. But as she realized many people had an
extremely negative impression of ECT, she stopped sharing her experience. ECT carried a deep stigma, leftover from a history that bears little
resemblance to the modern procedure. The therapy was first
used in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors administered a
strong electrical current to the brain, causing a whole-body seizure
during which patients might bite their tongues
or even break bones. Modern ECT is very different. While a patient is under 
general anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series
of mild electrical pulses to the brain. This causes huge numbers of neurons
to fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure. A muscle relaxant keeps spasms
from spreading to the rest of his body. The only physical indication of the
electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts for about a minute,
and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an
hour after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases
of major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded
to other therapies, or who have had adverse 
reactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo 
treatment experience an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or
three sessions per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement
in their symptoms after just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less frequent
treatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than
it used to be, but patients can still 
experience side effects. They may feel achy, fatigued, 
or nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble remembering what
happened right before a session— for example, what they had for 
dinner the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble 
remembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory
loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its 
proven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons in the brain communicate via
electrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked
by ECT alters that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release
of certain neurotransmitters, molecules that help carry signals between
neurons and influence mental health. ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones
that may help reduce symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication, even in patients who were
resistant to medication before. As we come to a better 
understanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make 
ECT even more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after
her first course of ECT, the nurse decided to publish an
account of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding
the treatment, she worried that doing so
might negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference
for patients when all else failed. Though misperceptions about ECT persist, accounts like hers have helped make
doctors and patients alike aware of the treatment’s 
life changing potential.

**Transcript**:
After years of experiments, you’ve finally created 
the pets of the future– nano-rabbits! They’re tiny, they’re fuzzy… and they multiply faster 
than the eye can see. In your lab there are 36 habitat cells, arranged in an inverted pyramid, with 8 cells in the top row. The first has one rabbit, the second has two, and so on, with eight rabbits in the last one. The other rows of cells are empty… for now. The rabbits are hermaphroditic, and each rabbit in a given 
cell will breed once with every rabbit in the horizontally 
adjacent cells, producing exactly one offspring each time. The newborn rabbits will 
drop into the cell directly below the 
two cells of its parents, and within minutes will mature 
and reproduce in turn. Each cell can hold 10^80 nano-rabbits – that’s a 1 followed by 80 zeros – before they break free 
and overrun the world. Your calculations have given you a 
46-digit number for the count of rabbits 
in the bottom cell– plenty of room to spare. But just as you pull the lever 
to start the experiment, your assistant runs in with terrible news. A rival lab has sabotaged your code so that all the zeros at the end 
of your results got cut off. That means you don’t actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold 
all the rabbits – and the reproduction is already underway! To make matters worse, your devices and calculators 
are all malfunctioning, so you only have a few minutes 
to work it out by hand. How many trailing zeros should there be at the end of the count of rabbits 
in the bottom habitat? And do you need to pull the emergency 
shut-down lever? Pause the video now if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough time to calculate the 
exact number of rabbits in the final cell. The good news is we don’t need to. All we need to figure out is how many trailing zeros it has. But how can we know how many trailing 
zeros a number has without calculating the number itself? What we do know is that we arrive at the
number of rabbits in the bottom cell through a process of multiplication – literally. The number of rabbits in each cell is the product of the number of rabbits 
in each of the two cells above it. And there are only two ways to get numbers with trailing zeros 
through multiplication: either multiplying a number ending in 5 
by any even number, or by multiplying numbers that have 
trailing zeroes themselves. Let’s calculate the number of rabbits 
in the second row and see what patterns emerge. Two of the numbers have trailing zeros – 20 rabbits in the fourth cell 
and 30 in the fifth cell. But there are no numbers ending in 5. And since the only way to get a number 
ending in 5 through multiplication is by starting with a number ending in 5, there won’t be any more 
down the line either. That means we only need to worry about the numbers that have 
trailing zeros themselves. And a neat trick to figure out the amount
of trailing zeros in a product is to count and add the trailing zeros 
in each of the factors – for example, 10 x 100 = 1,000. So let’s take the numbers in the fourth 
and fifth cells and multiply down from there. 20 and 30 each have one zero, so the product of both cells will have 
two trailing zeros, while the product of either cell and 
an adjacent non-zero-ending cell will have only one. When we continue all the way down, we end up with 35 zeros 
in the bottom cell. And if you’re not too stressed about 
the potential nano-rabbit apocalypse, you might notice that counting 
the zeros this way forms part of Pascal’s triangle. Adding those 35 zeros to the 
46 digit number we had before yields an 81 digit number – too big for the habitat to contain! You rush over and pull 
the emergency switch just as the seventh generation of rabbits 
was about to mature – hare-raisingly close to disaster.

**Transcript**:
After years of experiments, you’ve finally created 
the pets of the future– nano-rabbits! They’re tiny, they’re fuzzy… and they multiply faster 
than the eye can see. In your lab there are 36 habitat cells, arranged in an inverted pyramid, with 8 cells in the top row. The first has one rabbit, the second has two, and so on, with eight rabbits in the last one. The other rows of cells are empty… for now. The rabbits are hermaphroditic, and each rabbit in a given 
cell will breed once with every rabbit in the horizontally 
adjacent cells, producing exactly one offspring each time. The newborn rabbits will 
drop into the cell directly below the 
two cells of its parents, and within minutes will mature 
and reproduce in turn. Each cell can hold 10^80 nano-rabbits – that’s a 1 followed by 80 zeros – before they break free 
and overrun the world. Your calculations have given you a 
46-digit number for the count of rabbits 
in the bottom cell– plenty of room to spare. But just as you pull the lever 
to start the experiment, your assistant runs in with terrible news. A rival lab has sabotaged your code so that all the zeros at the end 
of your results got cut off. That means you don’t actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold 
all the rabbits – and the reproduction is already underway! To make matters worse, your devices and calculators 
are all malfunctioning, so you only have a few minutes 
to work it out by hand. How many trailing zeros should there be at the end of the count of rabbits 
in the bottom habitat? And do you need to pull the emergency 
shut-down lever? Pause the video now if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough time to calculate the 
exact number of rabbits in the final cell. The good news is we don’t need to. All we need to figure out is how many trailing zeros it has. But how can we know how many trailing 
zeros a number has without calculating the number itself? What we do know is that we arrive at the
number of rabbits in the bottom cell through a process of multiplication – literally. The number of rabbits in each cell is the product of the number of rabbits

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The full scope of a nuclear detonation 
is almost unimaginable. Hopefully, no one will ever experience 
another of these catastrophic incidents. But there is a scientifically supported 
plan of action that could save hundreds 
of thousands of lives in the area surrounding 
a nuclear explosion. So what is this plan, and what exactly would it protect us from? To create their destructive blast, these weapons harness 
the power of nuclear fission– in which an atom’s nucleus 
is split in two. This process produces an incredible 
amount of energy, and in some materials the neutrons 
produced by one fission are absorbed by nearby atoms, splitting additional nuclei. These chain reactions can produce 
a range of explosive yields, but let’s consider an explosion 
equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT. An explosion like this would create a fireball capable of decimating 
a few city blocks and a shockwave damaging buildings 
several kilometers away. There is tragically nothing 
that can be done to save those in the fireball’s radius. However, for those in the 
shockwave and beyond, our scientifically supported protocol 
could be life saving. And though it may sound surprising, the best way to stay protected before, 
during, and after a nuclear detonation, is getting inside. Similar to protecting yourself 
from tornadoes or hurricanes, getting and staying inside a sturdy 
building would offer protection from the explosion’s shockwave, 
heat, and radiation. The shockwave of energy would travel several kilometers beyond the fireball’s 
radius in the first few seconds. Sturdy buildings within that range should
be able to withstand the shockwave, and staying in the centers and basements 
of these buildings also helps provide protection from 
heat and flying objects. Finding shelter is especially important 
if the fireball occurs close to the earth, as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt 
and debris several kilometers into the atmosphere. As the fireball cools, unstable atoms created by the nuclear 
fission mix with the debris to produce the most dangerous long-term 
effect of a nuclear detonation: radioactive particles called fallout. These sand-sized particles emit 
ionizing radiation, capable of separating electrons from 
molecules and atoms. Exposure to massive amounts of this 
radiation can result in cell damage, radiation burns, radiation sickness, 
cancer, and even death. Created several kilometers up, dangerous concentrations of this material would be driven by upper 
atmospheric winds, potentially leading to hazardous 
levels of fallout in areas up to tens of 
kilometers downwind. Thankfully, the same buildings that offer
protection from the blast are even better at 
guarding against fallout. Radiation is reduced as it travels 
through space and mass. So while a broken window and sealed window both have the same minimal 
effect on radiation, thick layers of steel, concrete, 
and packed earth can offer serious protection. And since fallout gives off half of its 
energy in the first hour and 80% in the first day, staying inside for 24 hours could 
dramatically improve the odds of avoiding the most serious 
effects of radiation. Following the blast there would be at 
least 15 minutes to find shelter before the fallout begins. Since the most hazardous fallout particles
are the heaviest, they sink through the air and collect on streets and rooftops, making ideal shelters underground 
or in the middle of high-rise buildings. But if someone were to get 
caught in the fallout, there are still measures they could take. After finding a safe space, they should remove their shoes 
and outer layers, wash any exposed skin, and store the contaminated 
clothing far away. Once inside, plan on staying there 
for at least 24 hours. If the shelter is poor, or someone 
inside needs urgent medical attention, try seeking outside help after an hour. But ideally, stay inside and stay tuned for more 
information from first responders. While electric power, cell service, and
Internet would be down, most radios would likely survive. So listen in for emergency responders to determine the safest course forward. Nuclear weapons are some of the most 
powerful tools of destruction on Earth, and it may seem naive to put faith in
these straightforward protective measures. But studies and simulations have 
repeatedly shown the benefits of getting inside. So while we’ll hopefully never need to, remember to Get Inside, Stay Inside, 
and Stay Tuned.

However, I must point out that the generated MCQ does not match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the time it takes for fallout to begin after a nuclear detonation, while the generated MCQ asks about how staying inside for 24 hours can improve the odds of avoiding the most serious effects of radiation.

To provide a proper evaluation, I will first try to find a matching generated MCQ for the given ground truth MCQ. Since I don't have the entire set of generated MCQs, I will create a hypothetical generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Hypothetical Generated MCQ**:

equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT. An explosion like this would create a fireball capable of decimating 
a few city blocks and a shockwave damaging buildings 
several kilometers away. There is tragically nothing 
that can be done to save those in the fireball’s radius. However, for those in the 
shockwave and beyond, our scientifically supported protocol 
could be life saving. And though it may sound surprising, the best way to stay protected before, 
during, and after a nuclear detonation, is getting inside. Similar to protecting yourself 
from tornadoes or hurricanes, getting and staying inside a sturdy 
building would offer protection from the explosion’s shockwave, 
heat, and radiation. The shockwave of energy would travel several kilometers beyond the fireball’s 
radius in the first few seconds. Sturdy buildings within that range should
be able to withstand the shockwave, and staying in the centers and basements 
of these buildings also helps provide protection from 
heat and flying objects. Finding shelter is especially important 
if the fireball occurs close to the earth, as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt 
and debris several kilometers into the atmosphere. As the fireball cools, unstable atoms created by the nuclear 
fission mix with the debris to produce the most dangerous long-term 
effect of a nuclear detonation: radioactive particles called fallout. These sand-sized particles emit 
ionizing radiation, capable of separating electrons from 
molecules and atoms. Exposure to massive amounts of this 
radiation can result in cell damage, radiation burns, radiation sickness, 
cancer, and even death. Created several kilometers up, dangerous concentrations of this material would be driven by upper 
atmospheric winds, potentially leading to hazardous 
levels of fallout in areas up to tens of 
kilometers downwind. Thankfully, the same buildings that offer
protection from the blast are even better at 
guarding against fallout. Radiation is reduced as it travels 
through space and mass. So while a broken window and sealed window both have the same minimal 
effect on radiation, thick layers of steel, concrete, 
and packed earth can offer serious protection. And since fallout gives off half of its 
energy in the first hour and 80% in the first day, staying inside for 24 hours could 
dramatically improve the odds of avoiding the most serious 
effects of radiation. Following the blast there would be at 
least 15 minutes to find shelter before the fallout begins. Since the most hazardous fallout particles
are the heaviest, they sink through the air and collect on streets and rooftops, making ideal shelters underground 
or in the middle of high-rise buildings. But if someone were to get 
caught in the fallout, there are still measures they could take. After finding a safe space, they should remove their shoes 
and outer layers, wash any exposed skin, and store the contaminated 
clothing far away. Once inside, plan on staying there 
for at least 24 hours. If the shelter is poor, or someone 
inside needs urgent medical attention, try seeking outside help after an hour. But ideally, stay inside and stay tuned for more 
information from first responders. While electric power, cell service, and
Internet would be down, most radios would likely survive. So listen in for emergency responders to determine the safest course forward. Nuclear weapons are some of the most 
powerful tools of destruction on Earth, and it may seem naive to put faith in
these straightforward protective measures. But studies and simulations have 
repeatedly shown the benefits of getting inside. So while we’ll hopefully never need to, remember to Get Inside, Stay Inside, 
and Stay Tuned.

**Transcript**:
[♪ INTRO] In April of 2014, under the control of an
Emergency Manager appointed by the state of Michigan to help the city
through an ongoing financial crisis, Flint, Michigan switched its water supply. For decades, the city’s water had been piped
in from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, which got its water from Lake Huron and treated it. But in April of 2013, the decision was made
to build a pipeline and connect to a new system, the Karegnondi Water Authority. This would supply the city with lake water
that Flint would treat instead of Detroit, and was estimated to save 200 million dollars
over 25 years. In the meantime, as a sort of temporary fix
while the pipeline was being built, water would come in from the Flint River and be
treated at Flint's water treatment plant. Now, 4 years after that switch, we know that
it damaged hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure, caused deadly bacterial
outbreaks that killed at least 12 people, and exposed thousands of children to high
levels of lead in their drinking water. There are places to learn about the story
of how this happened, was covered up, and was eventually recognized, and the underlying situations that caused these massive mistakes to be made. So let's talk about the science of water. And how something as seemingly simple as a
switching to a different water source could lead to so many bad, but also seemingly unrelated,
outcomes. Humans have actually been using lead pipes
in water systems for hundreds of years, dating back to the ancient Romans. We eventually moved on to using other materials,
like iron. But in the late 1800s, engineers in the U.S.
were all about lead, because lead pipes were easier to bend around obstacles and were a
bit more durable than iron. People were suffering from lead poisoning,
but the public health risks weren’t seriously acknowledged until around the 1920s. And we gradually stopped making new water
pipes from lead. But in lots of cities in the U.S., like Flint,
Michigan, there are still several different kinds of metals in pipes for water. In Flint’s case, the pipes are made of lead
and iron. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency didn’t
have any sort of serious regulation about lead pipes until the Lead and Copper Rule
was enacted in 1991. It requires regular monitoring and action
plans if old lead pipes start becoming dangerous. So, all that to say, lead water pipes are
not that unusual, a 2016 study estimates that
there are still millions in use. And even though no amount of lead ingested
by a human is considered safe, maybe surprisingly, many of these
water systems are usually safe. A big part of the reason why is anti-corrosion
chemicals in the water, like orthophosphate. Orthophosphate helps lead and some other metal
pipes from corroding by forming a compound that makes a sort of protective layer on the
inside of the pipe. If that layer is patchy or missing, then electron-stealing
chemicals called oxidants, like dissolved oxygen gas, can react with the lead. And when that happens, the lead will dissolve
into the water and contaminate it. You’ve probably heard of that. It’s known as leaching, and it’s when
things get dangerous for people who need this water to drink or shower or do anything with
on their bodies. Flint, and it is unclear why besides possibly
cutting costs, did not add orthophosphate or any sort of anti-corrosion chemicals when
switching to Flint River water. Even though the treated water from Detroit
had had them. And because Flint was using iron and lead
pipes, both iron and lead ended up in the water. But that’s not the whole story. Not only were these pipes left unprotected,
but the water flowing through them also contained higher than average chloride levels. Research has found that chloride helps the
process of corrosion along. When there are enough chloride ions in the
water compared to some other ions, they start forming chemical complexes with lead and other
atoms. And these chloride complexes are soluble. So, basically, it’s another way that lead
can get into the water. Part of this too-much-chloride problem was
from the river water itself. Sodium chloride, which is just table salt,
would often wash into the river after being used as a de-icer on roads. But another part of it had to do with the
fact that, a couple of months after the switch to the Flint River water, there was also a
huge bacterial problem. The river water wasn’t just, like, extremely
dangerous, though. We know how to treat water. We put in disinfectants like chlorine, which can rip
open bacteria or mess with the molecules inside them. But it turns out that chlorine disinfectant
can react with metals from corroding pipes, especially iron, to become completely different compounds that do absolutely
nothing to control bacteria. So the disinfectants were made useless. Plus, more chloride ions ended up floating
around, which only made the corrosion process worse. And thus, the vicious cycle escalated. By August of 2014, there was a city warning
that E. coli and other typically gut-dwelling bacteria, collectively called fecal coliform
bacteria, were thriving in the water and could make people sick. The Flint treatment plant upped the amount
of chlorine they were using to try to kill off these contaminants. But because the pipes were already corroding,
it wasn’t working. Not only that, but all this extra chlorine
they were adding also reacted with some of the organic chemicals from the river water
to form disinfection byproducts called trihalomethanes. And, researchers have found trihalomethanes
to be linked to health problems and even cancer. So not only was the chlorine turning into
a bunch of non-disinfectant chemicals, one of those was potentially a carcinogen. Trihalomethanes in the water quickly swelled
to above the national regulatory limit. So to try and fix that problem, the treatment
plant added coagulants that would react with the organic matter in the water to help them
filter it out. Specifically, they used a chemical called
ferric chloride. Which took care of the trihalomethanes, but meant they were adding
even more chloride to the water. As the pipes got worse and more chlorine was
turned into useless compounds, the elevated bacterial levels became deadly. Between April 2014 and October 2015, at least
12 people died and 91 people got sick from an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, the
third largest recorded in U.S. history. Before the switch to the Flint River water,
there were only a handful of cases per year. Legionnaires’ disease is basically a really
intense pneumonia. It’s caused by breathing in water-borne
bacteria that infect the lungs so they get inflamed and lead to other symptoms. This outbreak was caused by a bacterium called
Legionella pneumophila, specifically the serogroup 6 strain, which isn’t usually detected in
the standard urine test for the disease. After some extensive studies, most researchers
agree that this chlorine inactivation at least played a part in letting these bacteria flourish. On top of that, some of the experts and investigative journalists think that there could have been more deaths than were officially confirmed, because of how tricky it can be
to diagnose Legionnaires’ disease. Some deaths caused by these bacterias could
have been attributed to pneumonia in general, and thus not counted. So, counterintuitive as it might seem, not
adding corrosion control also deactivated the chlorine disinfectant to basically undetectable
levels, resulting in tragic loss of life. In addition to all this, though, there was the ongoing
problem of metals leaching into the water supply. Which we definitely know was because of how
the Flint River water was treated. Because of all these chemical reactions, the
process by which lead and other metals got into the water was not slow and constant. Sometimes the pipes would leach metal slowly. But sometimes metal compounds, like the protective
layer that wasn’t being maintained, flaked off in little hunks, some of which were even
visible to the naked eye. The leached iron made the water look kind
of horrible and taste kind of rusty, but it isn’t a big health concern on its own. Lead is. But you can’t see, smell, or taste it in
water. A single tiny lead flake can take water from
safe, to far over the EPA’s limit of 15 parts per billion, which requires public action
to be taken. And besides randomly super contaminated samples
being right next to uncontaminated samples because of flakes, the protocols for testing
for lead can be manipulated to make it less likely to record how contaminated the water
actually is. Official EPA protocols for measuring drinking
water quality involves letting the water sit in pipes for at least 6 hours, and then collecting
it after a couple minutes. City protocols called for pre-flushing
the pipes for five minutes before letting them sit for 6 hours. And, according to experts, this pre-flushing
can sweep out initial bursts of lead particles so they’re not in the sample. Plus, people don’t just go turning on their
water every once in a while, so those samples aren’t necessarily reflective of what they’re
using and drinking. Even still, when the City of Flint tested
one resident’s water in February and March of 2015, they found lead levels at 104 ppb
and 397 ppb, far above the EPA’s action level. When researchers from Virginia Tech sampled
water from the same pipes at low, medium, and high flow rates, they found levels ranging
from 220 ppb to a whopping 13,200 ppb. And, to be totally clear about how intense
this is, a substance with more than 5,000 parts per billion of lead is considered hazardous
waste by the EPA. By September 2015, those same researchers
had collected and analyzed 252 water samples from various Flint homes. 101 of the samples had more than 5 ppb of
lead. And they estimated that 90% of homes had a
lead level below 25 ppb; 10% were above that. Which, and I can’t say this enough, was a lot of homes above that 15 parts per billion EPA limit for water. Protocols matter, y'all! So that's how metals ended up in the water. No corrosion control and high
corrosive chemical concentrations exposed many thousands
of people to lead poisoning. And lead poisoning can cause incredibly serious
health problems. Lead interferes with a lot of different enzymes,
can cause cells to die, and can slip past the protective blood-brain barrier to seriously
mess with the central nervous system. We don’t know exactly how it interacts with
all those systems, but lead ions are chemically pretty similar to calcium ions, which our
bodies use all the time in lots of chemical processes. So that may have something to do with it. In any case, it’s incredibly detrimental
to human bodies and brains, in adults and especially in children. All of this was made worse by the fact that
the city of Flint has a water system built to deliver water to over 200,000 people. Since the population peaked at around that in
the 1960s, it has declined to less than half that. So in some areas, the water moved through
some pipes slowly or sat stagnant. As the Flint River water sat in the pipes
and the corrosive chemistry did its thing, metal concentration rose, disinfectant concentration
decreased, and bacterial growth increased. The city of Flint switched back to piping
in treated water from the Detroit water system in October 2015, after 18 months. And they’re adding in extra phosphate chemicals
to try to build up that protective layer again. But that doesn't just fix the problem that
had escalated over that year and a half. The pipes have already corroded, as have plumbing
fixtures and water heaters of many residents. So while the gradual leaching is hopefully
going down, metal flakes may still be chipping off. Tests show that lead levels are down,
and that’s great news, but many residents have also, understandably, lost faith in the government agencies that are now
reporting that the water is safe. The city is now undergoing a massively expensive
process of replacing all of its lead pipes. A step that was taken to save money has ended
up costing far more money than it could have saved, not to mention lost health, and lost
lives. The way that science was ignored, unknown,
or even misused in this story is a lesson that we all have to live with, and one that
we at SciShow hope that we can learn from. Thanks to our patrons on Patreon who support

**Transcript**:
Loki the mischief-maker, was writhing
uncomfortably in Thor’s iron grip. The previous night, while the rest of the
gods slept, he’d snuck up on Thor’s wife Sif and shorn off her beautiful hair. It’d seemed like a funny 
prank at the time, but now Thor was about to
break every bone in his body. Loki had to think of some
way to fix what he’d done. Yet who could replace Sif’s matchless
hair, golden like a field of summer wheat? The dwarves! – their legendary
smiths could make anything. So Loki rushed to their realm, 
deep within the mountains of the earth. Even before he arrived, the wily Loki was
already scheming how he would get the
dwarves to do his bidding. He decided that his best bet was to pit
two families against each other. He first visited the masterful
sons of Ivaldi.  He told them that their rivals,
a pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri, had claimed that they were the best
craftsmen in the world and were determined to prove
it in a competition. The rules were that each family had to 
create three gifts for the gods, including, for the Ivaldis, golden hair. Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri,
and told them the same thing,  only now claiming that the sons
of Ivaldi had issued the challenge. But Brokk and Eitri couldn’t 
be fooled so easily, and only agreed to participate
if Loki put his own head on the line. Literally—if Brokk and Eitri won, 
Loki would forfeit his head to them. Loki had no choice but to agree,
and to save himself had to find a way to make sure the sons of
Ivaldi emerged victorious. Both sets of dwarves got to work. Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows and
told him not to stop for any reason, or the treasures would be ruined. Soon a strange black fly
flew into the room. As a piece of pigskin was placed in the
forge, the fly stung Brokk’s hand, but he didn’t flinch. Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,
the fly bit Brokk on the neck. The dwarf carried on. Finally, Eitri placed a piece
of iron in the furnace. This time the fly landed right on Brokk’s
eyelid and bit as hard as it could. And for just a split second,
Brokk’s hand left the bellows. That’s all it took; their final treasure
hadn’t stayed in the fire long enough. Loki now reappeared in his normal form,
overjoyed by their failure, and accompanied the dwarves to present
their treasures to the gods. First, Loki presented the treasures
from the sons of Ivaldi. Their golden hair bound to Sif’s
head and continued to grow, leaving her even more radiant than before. Next, for Odin the all-father, a magnificent spear that could
pierce through anything. And finally a small cloth that unfolded
into a mighty ship built for Freyr, god of the harvest. Then Brokk presented the treasures
made by him and his brother. For Freyr they’d forged 
a golden-bristled boar who’d pull Freyr’s chariot across
the sky faster than any mount. For Odin, a golden arm ring which would
make eight more identical rings on every ninth night. And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir. Its handle was too short,
and Loki smirked at the obvious defect. But then Brokk revealed its abilities. Mjolnir would never shatter, 
never miss its mark and always return
to Thor’s hand when thrown. Despite the short handle, the gods all 
agreed this was the finest gift of all. Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried 
to flee, but Thor reached him first. But before the dwarves could have their due, clever Loki pointed out that they had won
the rights to his head, but not his neck, and thus had no right to cut it. All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,
but Brokk would have the last laugh. Taking his brother’s awl,
he pierced it through Loki’s lips and sewed his mouth shut, so the trickster god could no longer
spread his malicious deceit. Yet the irony was not lost on the gods. For it was Loki’s deceit that had brought
them these fine treasures and given Thor the hammer
for which he’s still known today.

into a mighty ship built for Freyr, god of the harvest. Then Brokk presented the treasures
made by him and his brother. For Freyr they’d forged 
a golden-bristled boar who’d pull Freyr’s chariot across
the sky faster than any mount. For Odin, a golden arm ring which would
make eight more identical rings on every ninth night. And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir. Its handle was too short,
and Loki smirked at the obvious defect. But then Brokk revealed its abilities. Mjolnir would never shatter, 
never miss its mark and always return
to Thor’s hand when thrown. Despite the short handle, the gods all 
agreed this was the finest gift of all. Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried 
to flee, but Thor reached him first. But before the dwarves could have their due, clever Loki pointed out that they had won
the rights to his head, but not his neck, and thus had no right to cut it. All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,
but Brokk would have the last laugh. Taking his brother’s awl,
he pierced it through Loki’s lips and sewed his mouth shut, so the trickster god could no longer
spread his malicious deceit. Yet the irony was not lost on the gods. For it was Loki’s deceit that had brought
them these fine treasures and given Thor the hammer
for which he’s still known today.

**Transcript**:
Loki the mischief-maker, was writhing
uncomfortably in Thor’s iron grip. The previous night, while the rest of the
gods slept, he’d snuck up on Thor’s wife Sif and shorn off her beautiful hair. It’d seemed like a funny 
prank at the time, but now Thor was about to
break every bone in his body. Loki had to think of some
way to fix what he’d done. Yet who could replace Sif’s matchless
hair, golden like a field of summer wheat? The dwarves! – their legendary
smiths could make anything. So Loki rushed to their realm, 
deep within the mountains of the earth. Even before he arrived, the wily Loki was
already scheming how he would get the
dwarves to do his bidding. He decided that his best bet was to pit
two families against each other. He first visited the masterful
sons of Ivaldi.  He told them that their rivals,
a pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri, had claimed that they were the best
craftsmen in the world and were determined to prove
it in a competition. The rules were that each family had to 
create three gifts for the gods, including, for the Ivaldis, golden hair. Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri,
and told them the same thing,  only now claiming that the sons
of Ivaldi had issued the challenge. But Brokk and Eitri couldn’t 
be fooled so easily, and only agreed to participate
if Loki put his own head on the line. Literally—if Brokk and Eitri won, 
Loki would forfeit his head to them. Loki had no choice but to agree,
and to save himself had to find a way to make sure the sons of
Ivaldi emerged victorious. Both sets of dwarves got to work. Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows and
told him not to stop for any reason, or the treasures would be ruined. Soon a strange black fly
flew into the room. As a piece of pigskin was placed in the
forge, the fly stung Brokk’s hand, but he didn’t flinch. Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,
the fly bit Brokk on the neck. The dwarf carried on. Finally, Eitri placed a piece
of iron in the furnace. This time the fly landed right on Brokk’s
eyelid and bit as hard as it could. And for just a split second,
Brokk’s hand left the bellows. That’s all it took; their final treasure
hadn’t stayed in the fire long enough. Loki now reappeared in his normal form,
overjoyed by their failure, and accompanied the dwarves to present
their treasures to the gods. First, Loki presented the treasures
from the sons of Ivaldi. Their golden hair bound to Sif’s
head and continued to grow, leaving her even more radiant than before. Next, for Odin the all-father, a magnificent spear that could
pierce through anything. And finally a small cloth that unfolded

**Transcript**:
On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship
Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight, leaving only 118 of her 
2,200 crew members alive. But when a British destroyer came to
collect the prisoners, they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white
cat clinging to a floating plank. For the next several months this cat
hunted rats and raised British morale - until a sudden torpedo strike shattered
the hull and sank the ship. But, miraculously, not the cat. Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessels – one of which also sank - before
retiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors. Many may not think of cats as serviceable
sailors, or cooperative companions 
of any kind. But cats have been working alongside
humans for thousands of years -  helping us just as often as we help them. So how did these solitary creatures go 
from wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick? The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than
10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era. People were learning to bend nature
to their will, producing much more food than
farmers could eat at one time. These Neolithic farmers stored their excess
grain in large pits and short, clay silos. But these stores of food attracted
hordes of rodents, as well as their predator,
Felis silvestris lybica - the wildcat found across North Africa
and Southwest Asia. These wildcats were fast, fierce,
carnivorous hunters. And they were remarkably similar in size
and appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient
wildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social
towards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested 
granaries drew in these typically solitary animals.  And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the 
presence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated
the cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that
the cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe
and the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major
scourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and
gnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become
essential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian
globe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated 
their own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch
venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important
to Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,
hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate
from port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,
ships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the
central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, 
Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern 
and North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point -- 
continued to travel across Europe, eventually setting sail for
Australia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern
or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica. But close analysis of the genomes and
coat patterns of modern cats tells us that unlike dogs, which have undergone 
centuries of selective breeding, modern cats are genetically
very similar to ancient cats. And apart from making them
more social and docile, we’ve done little to alter
their natural behaviors. In other words, cats today are more or
less as they’ve always been: Wild animals. Fierce hunters. Creatures that don’t
see us as their keepers. And given our long history together,
they might not be wrong.

Evaluation Prompt:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship
Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight, leaving only 118 of her 
2,200 crew members alive. But when a British destroyer came to
collect the prisoners, they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white
cat clinging to a floating plank. For the next several months this cat
hunted rats and raised British morale - until a sudden torpedo strike shattered
the hull and sank the ship. But, miraculously, not the cat. Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessels – one of which also sank - before
retiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors. Many may not think of cats as serviceable
sailors, or cooperative companions 
of any kind. But cats have been working alongside
humans for thousands of years -  helping us just as often as we help them. So how did these solitary creatures go 
from wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick? The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than
10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era. People were learning to bend nature
to their will, producing much more food than
farmers could eat at one time. These Neolithic farmers stored their excess
grain in large pits and short, clay silos. But these stores of food attracted
hordes of rodents, as well as their predator,
Felis silvestris lybica - the wildcat found across North Africa
and Southwest Asia. These wildcats were fast, fierce,
carnivorous hunters. And they were remarkably similar in size
and appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient
wildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social
towards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested 
granaries drew in these typically solitary animals.  And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the 
presence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated
the cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that
the cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe
and the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major
scourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and
gnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become
essential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian
globe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated 
their own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch
venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important
to Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,
hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate
from port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,
ships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the
central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, 
Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern 
and North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point -- 
continued to travel across Europe, eventually setting sail for
Australia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern
or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica. But close analysis of the genomes and
coat patterns of modern cats tells us that unlike dogs, which have undergone 
centuries of selective breeding, modern cats are genetically
very similar to ancient cats. And apart from making them
more social and docile, we’ve done little to alter
their natural behaviors. In other words, cats today are more or
less as they’ve always been: Wild animals. Fierce hunters. Creatures that don’t
see us as their keepers. And given our long history together,
they might not be wrong.

essential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian
globe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated 
their own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch
venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important
to Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,
hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate
from port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,
ships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the
central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, 
Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern 
and North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point -- 
continued to travel across Europe, eventually setting sail for
Australia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern
or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica. But close analysis of the genomes and
coat patterns of modern cats tells us that unlike dogs, which have undergone 
centuries of selective breeding, modern cats are genetically
very similar to ancient cats. And apart from making them
more social and docile, we’ve done little to alter
their natural behaviors. In other words, cats today are more or
less as they’ve always been: Wild animals. Fierce hunters. Creatures that don’t
see us as their keepers. And given our long history together,
they might not be wrong.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’ve discovered a doorway
to another realm, and now you and your brother  are off exploring the wonderful
world of Paradoxica. Fantastically paradoxical creatures crawl,
run, and fly around you. And then you see the troll. It’s catching all the creatures
in an enormous net. You bravely step forward
and demand it let them go. The troll laughs. “If you’re such a
fan of paradoxes,” it says, “then I’ll make you an offer. If you say something true,
I’ll release all these creatures." You’re about to say, “You are a troll,” but before you can,
the troll grabs your brother. “If you say something false,”
he continues, “then I’ll release your brother." Your statement can 
only be a single sentence. And as you can see,
I hate paradoxes more than anything. If you try to cheat
by saying something paradoxical, like, ‘this statement is false,’ then I'll eat your brother 
and the creatures." What true/false statement
can you say to force the troll to free your brother
and the paradoxical creatures? [Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out for yourself!] Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This seems like an impossible situation, but incredibly, you can say something that will force the troll to
release all its prisoners. This is an example of coercive logic, invented by the great logician 
and puzzle creator Raymond Smullyan. The trick Smullyan came up with
involves saying a statement whose truth or falseness depends on
what you want the troll to do. Your statement still
has to be carefully crafted. For example, if you were to say, “You are going to free the 
creatures and my brother,” the troll could respond, “that’s false… 
I’m only going to free your brother.” Similarly, if you said, “You will free 
the paradoxes,” the troll could say, “That’s true,” 
and free the paradoxes. But watch what happens if you say,
“You will free my brother.” The statement can’t be false, because if it were, the troll, 
by its own rules, would have to free your brother. That would make the statement
paradoxically true and false. But the troll hates paradoxes and would never willingly create one. So his only option 
is for the statement to be true. If “you will free my brother” is true, then the troll 
has to release your brother. And by its own rules, the troll
has to free the creatures as well, since you said a true statement. By wielding just 5 words
like a logical scalpel, you’ve forced the troll
to free all its prisoners. As the troll stomps off in anger, the paradoxes cheer you
for winning them their freedom, and promise to lead you to the
treasure at the top of the stairs. If you can reach it.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A male firefly glows above a field 
on a summer’s night, emitting a series of enticing flashes. He hopes a nearby female will respond
with her own lightshow and mate with him. Sadly for this male, it won’t turn out quite the way he plans. A female from a different species 
mimics his pulsing patterns: by tricking the male with 
her promise of partnership, she lures him in– and turns him into an easy meal. He’s been deceived. Behavioral biologists have identified 
three defining hallmarks of deception by non-human animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it can’t simply be an accident. In this case we know that the predatory 
firefly’s signal isn’t an accident because she flexibly 
adjusts her flash pattern to match males of different species. Based on this definition, where is animal deception seen in nature? Camouflage is a good starting point– and one of the most familiar examples 
of animal trickery. The leaf-tailed gecko and the 
octopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces 
on which they rest. Other animals use mimicry 
to protect themselves. Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved 
red, yellow, and black patterns resembling those of the venomous 
eastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warnings 
these markings convey. Even some plants use mimicry: there are orchids that look and smell like
female wasps to attract hapless males, who end up pollinating the plant. Some of these animals benefit 
by having fixed characteristics that are evolutionary suited 
to their environments. But in other cases, the deceiver seems to anticipate 
the reactions of other animals and to adjust its behavior accordingly. Sensing a threat, the octopus will rapidly change its colors
to match its surroundings. Dwarf chameleons color-match their 
environments more closely when they see a bird predator 
rather than a snake– birds, after all, 
have better color vision. One of the more fascinating 
examples of animal deception comes from the fork-tailed drongo. This bird sits atop tall trees 
in the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for predators 
and calling when it senses a threat. That sends meerkats, pied babblers, 
and others dashing for cover. But the drongo will also sound 
a false alarm when those other species 
have captured prey. As the meerkats and babblers flee, the drongo swoops down 
to steal their catches. This tactic works about half the time– and it provides drongos 
with much of their food. There are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members 
of their own species, but that happens too. Consider the mantis shrimp. Like other crustaceans, it molts as it grows, which leaves its soft body 
vulnerable to attack. But it’s still driven to protect 
its home against rivals. So it has become a masterful bluffer. Despite being fragile, a newly molted shrimp is actually 
more likely to threaten intruders, spreading the large limbs it usually uses 
to strike or stab its opponents. And that works – bluffers are more likely to keep 
their homes than non-bluffers. In its softened condition, a mantis shrimp couldn’t 
withstand a fight– which is why we can be confident that its behavior is a bluff. Biologists have even noticed 
that its bluffs are tactical: newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely
to bluff against smaller rivals, who are especially likely 
to be driven away. It would seem that instead of just 
threatening reflexively, the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the 
situation and predicting others’ behavior, to get the best result. So we know that animals can deceive, but do they do so with intent? That’s a difficult question, and many scientists think 
we'll never be able to answer it. We can't observe animals’ 
internal thoughts. But we don’t need to know what an animal

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A male firefly glows above a field 
on a summer’s night, emitting a series of enticing flashes. He hopes a nearby female will respond
with her own lightshow and mate with him. Sadly for this male, it won’t turn out quite the way he plans. A female from a different species 
mimics his pulsing patterns: by tricking the male with 
her promise of partnership, she lures him in– and turns him into an easy meal. He’s been deceived. Behavioral biologists have identified 
three defining hallmarks of deception by non-human animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it can’t simply be an accident. In this case we know that the predatory 
firefly’s signal isn’t an accident because she flexibly 
adjusts her flash pattern to match males of different species. Based on this definition, where is animal deception seen in nature? Camouflage is a good starting point– and one of the most familiar examples 
of animal trickery. The leaf-tailed gecko and the 
octopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces 
on which they rest. Other animals use mimicry 
to protect themselves. Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved 
red, yellow, and black patterns resembling those of the venomous 
eastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warnings 
these markings convey. Even some plants use mimicry: there are orchids that look and smell like
female wasps to attract hapless males, who end up pollinating the plant. Some of these animals benefit 
by having fixed characteristics that are evolutionary suited 
to their environments. But in other cases, the deceiver seems to anticipate 
the reactions of other animals and to adjust its behavior accordingly. Sensing a threat, the octopus will rapidly change its colors
to match its surroundings. Dwarf chameleons color-match their 
environments more closely when they see a bird predator 
rather than a snake– birds, after all, 
have better color vision. One of the more fascinating 
examples of animal deception comes from the fork-tailed drongo. This bird sits atop tall trees 
in the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for predators 
and calling when it senses a threat. That sends meerkats, pied babblers, 
and others dashing for cover. But the drongo will also sound 
a false alarm when those other species 
have captured prey. As the meerkats and babblers flee, the drongo swoops down 
to steal their catches. This tactic works about half the time– and it provides drongos 
with much of their food. There are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members

**Transcript**:
Roald Amundsen had spent nearly two
years preparing his Arctic expedition. He had secured funding from the Norwegian
Crown and hand-picked a trusted crew. He’d even received the blessing of
the famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen, along with the use of his ship, Fram, 
specially constructed to withstand the ice. Now, with the voyage departing, he had 
one final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the
opposite direction. By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had
been visited and mapped, with only two key locations
remaining: the North Pole, deep in the
frozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a
recently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of
reaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers
Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims
to the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to
what he called “the last great problem.” But Amundsen’s crew weren’t 
the only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had
already visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own 
South Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova 
reached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news
that Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted
against the Norwegian in what the newspapers 
called a ‘race to the Pole.’ Yet if it was a race,
it was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times
from different locations, and they had very different 
plans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely
on reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and 
Norwegian experience, arriving with a small team of
men and more than a hundred dogs. His explorers were clothed
in sealskin and furs, as well as specially
designed skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated. Launching an extensive scientific 
research expedition, he traveled with over three times 
more men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs, 
19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art
motorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled
the storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies, they found both their ponies and 
motor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow. In the spring of 1911, after waiting out
the long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled 
over the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's
earlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been
documented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time
using a previously uncharted route through the same Transantarctic Mountains. They stayed ahead of Scott’s team, and on December 14, arrived first
at their desolate destination. To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded
Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims, Amundsen’s team traversed
the area in a grid to make sure they covered
the Pole’s location. Along with flags and a tent marker, they left a letter for Scott, which would
not be found until over a month later. But when Scott’s party
finally reached the pole, losing the ‘race’ was
the least of their problems.  On the way back towards the camp,
two of the five men succumbed to frostbite starvation, and exhaustion. The remaining explorers hoped for a
prearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base, but due to a series of mishaps, 
misjudgements and miscommunications, their rescue never arrived. Their remains, along with Scott’s diary,
would not be found until spring. Today, scientists from various countries live and work at Antarctic 
research stations. But the journeys of these early
explorers are not forgotten. Despite their divergent fates,
they are forever joined in history, and in the name of the research
base that marks the South Pole.

**Transcript**:
Roald Amundsen had spent nearly two
years preparing his Arctic expedition. He had secured funding from the Norwegian
Crown and hand-picked a trusted crew. He’d even received the blessing of
the famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen, along with the use of his ship, Fram, 
specially constructed to withstand the ice. Now, with the voyage departing, he had 
one final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the
opposite direction. By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had
been visited and mapped, with only two key locations
remaining: the North Pole, deep in the
frozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a
recently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of
reaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers
Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims
to the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to
what he called “the last great problem.” But Amundsen’s crew weren’t 
the only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had
already visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own 
South Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova 
reached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news
that Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted
against the Norwegian in what the newspapers 
called a ‘race to the Pole.’ Yet if it was a race,
it was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times
from different locations, and they had very different 
plans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely
on reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and 
Norwegian experience, arriving with a small team of
men and more than a hundred dogs. His explorers were clothed
in sealskin and furs, as well as specially
designed skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated. Launching an extensive scientific 
research expedition, he traveled with over three times 
more men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs, 
19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art
motorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled
the storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies, they found both their ponies and 
motor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow. In the spring of 1911, after waiting out
the long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled 
over the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's
earlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been
documented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time
using a previously uncharted route through the same Transantarctic Mountains. They stayed ahead of Scott’s team, and on December 14, arrived first
at their desolate destination. To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded
Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims, Amundsen’s team traversed
the area in a grid to make sure they covered
the Pole’s location. Along with flags and a tent marker, they left a letter for Scott, which would
not be found until over a month later. But when Scott’s party
finally reached the pole, losing the ‘race’ was
the least of their problems.  On the way back towards the camp,
two of the five men succumbed to frostbite starvation, and exhaustion. The remaining explorers hoped for a
prearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base, but due to a series of mishaps, 
misjudgements and miscommunications, their rescue never arrived. Their remains, along with Scott’s diary,
would not be found until spring. Today, scientists from various countries live and work at Antarctic 
research stations. But the journeys of these early
explorers are not forgotten. Despite their divergent fates,
they are forever joined in history, and in the name of the research
base that marks the South Pole.

**Transcript**:
Your internship in Professor Ramsey’s
physics lab has been amazing. Until, that is, the professor accidentally
stepped through a time portal. You’ve got just a minute to jump through
the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history. Once you’re through it, 
the portal will close, and your only way back will be 
to create a new one using the chrono-nodules from your lab. Activated nodules connect to each other via red or blue tachyon entanglement. Activate more nodules and they’ll connect to all other nodules in the area. As soon as a red or blue triangle is
created with a nodule at each point, it opens a doorway through time that
will take you back to the present. But the color of each individual
connection manifests at random, and there’s no way to choose
or change its color. And there’s one more problem: each individual nodule creates a
temporal instability that raises the chances the portal
might collapse as you go through it. So the fewer you bring, the better. The portal’s about to close. What’s the minimum number of nodules 
you need to bring to be certain you’ll create a red or 
blue triangle and get back to the present? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This question is so rich that an entire
branch of mathematics known as Ramsey Theory developed from it. Ramsey Theory is home to some
famously difficult problems. This one isn’t easy, but it can be handled if you approach it systematically. Imagine you brought just three nodules. Would that be enough? No - for example,
you might have two blue and one red connection,
and be stuck in the past forever. Would four nodules be enough?
No - there are many arrangements here that don’t give a blue or red triangle. What about five? It turns out there is an arrangement of
connections that avoids creating 
a blue or red triangle. These smaller triangles don’t count because
they don’t have a nodule at each corner. However, six nodules will always create a
blue triangle or a red triangle. Here’s how we can prove that without
sorting through every possible case. Imagine activating the sixth nodule, and consider how it might connect
to the other five. It could do so in one of six ways: with five red connections, five blue
connections, or some mix of red and blue. Notice that every possibility has at least
three connections of the same color coming from this nodule. Let’s look at just the nodules
on the other end of those same three color connections. If the connections were blue, then any additional blue connection between
those three would give us a blue triangle. So the only way we could get in trouble is if all the connections
between them were red. But those three red connections
would give us a red triangle. No matter what happens,
we’ll get a red or a blue triangle, and open our doorway.  On the other hand, if the original three connections 
were all red instead of blue, the same argument still works, 
with all the colors flipped. In other words, no matter how the
connections are colored, six nodules will always create a red or 
blue triangle and a doorway leading home. So you grab six nodules and jump through
the portal. You were hoping your internship would
give you valuable life experience. Turns out, that didn’t take much time.

connections, or some mix of red and blue. Notice that every possibility has at least
three connections of the same color coming from this nodule. Let’s look at just the nodules
on the other end of those same three color connections. If the connections were blue, then any additional blue connection between
those three would give us a blue triangle. So the only way we could get in trouble is if all the connections
between them were red. But those three red connections
would give us a red triangle. No matter what happens,
we’ll get a red or a blue triangle, and open our doorway.  On the other hand, if the original three connections 
were all red instead of blue, the same argument still works, 
with all the colors flipped. In other words, no matter how the
connections are colored, six nodules will always create a red or 
blue triangle and a doorway leading home. So you grab six nodules and jump through
the portal. You were hoping your internship would
give you valuable life experience. Turns out, that didn’t take much time.

**Transcript**:
Your internship in Professor Ramsey’s
physics lab has been amazing. Until, that is, the professor accidentally
stepped through a time portal. You’ve got just a minute to jump through
the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history. Once you’re through it, 
the portal will close, and your only way back will be 
to create a new one using the chrono-nodules from your lab. Activated nodules connect to each other via red or blue tachyon entanglement. Activate more nodules and they’ll connect to all other nodules in the area. As soon as a red or blue triangle is
created with a nodule at each point, it opens a doorway through time that
will take you back to the present. But the color of each individual
connection manifests at random, and there’s no way to choose
or change its color. And there’s one more problem: each individual nodule creates a
temporal instability that raises the chances the portal
might collapse as you go through it. So the fewer you bring, the better. The portal’s about to close. What’s the minimum number of nodules 
you need to bring to be certain you’ll create a red or 
blue triangle and get back to the present? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This question is so rich that an entire
branch of mathematics known as Ramsey Theory developed from it. Ramsey Theory is home to some
famously difficult problems. This one isn’t easy, but it can be handled if you approach it systematically. Imagine you brought just three nodules. Would that be enough? No - for example,
you might have two blue and one red connection,
and be stuck in the past forever. Would four nodules be enough?
No - there are many arrangements here that don’t give a blue or red triangle. What about five? It turns out there is an arrangement of
connections that avoids creating 
a blue or red triangle. These smaller triangles don’t count because
they don’t have a nodule at each corner. However, six nodules will always create a
blue triangle or a red triangle. Here’s how we can prove that without
sorting through every possible case. Imagine activating the sixth nodule, and consider how it might connect
to the other five. It could do so in one of six ways: with five red connections, five blue
connections, or some mix of red and blue. Notice that every possibility has at least
three connections of the same color coming from this nodule. Let’s look at just the nodules
on the other end of those same three color connections. If the connections were blue, then any additional blue connection between
those three would give us a blue triangle. So the only way we could get in trouble is if all the connections
between them were red. But those three red connections
would give us a red triangle. No matter what happens,
we’ll get a red or a blue triangle, and open our doorway.  On the other hand, if the original three connections 
were all red instead of blue, the same argument still works, 
with all the colors flipped. In other words, no matter how the

**Transcript**:
a group of youths sneak into the woods, where they take mind-altering substances, switch it up romantically, and brush up against creatures 
from another dimension. "A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream" sees 
Shakespeare get psychedelic – and the result is a treat in the 
theatre and on the page. First performed in the 1590's, this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works, filled with trickery, madness and magic. Set over the course of one night, Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace. The plot is structured around patterns of 
collision and dissolution, where characters from different worlds 
are thrown together and torn apart. Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock 
the characters’ self-obsession and question authority with a comic twist. The action is set in Ancient Greece, but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns. The magical setting of the woods at night disrupts the boundaries between 
separate groups, with bizarre results. Here, the bard plays with the rigid class 
system of his own time, taking three distinct groups
and turning their society upside-down in a world where no mortal is in control. The play opens with young Hermia raging at her father Egeus and 
Theseus, the King of Athens, who have forbidden her to marry 
her lover Lysander. Hermia has no interest in her father's 
choice for her of Demetrius – but her best friend Helena 
definitely does. Furious at their elders, Hermia and 
Lysander elope under cover of darkness, with Demetrius in hot pursuit. This is further complicated 
by Helena’s decision to follow them all into the woods,
in the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart. At this point, the woods are 
getting crowded, as the lovers are sharing the space 
with a group of “rude mechanicals”— a troupe of workers drunkenly rehearsing 
a play, led by the jovial Nick Bottom. Unbeknownst to them, the humans have 
entered into the world of the fairies. Despite their magical splendor, 
Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies, 
have their own romantic problems. Furious at his inability to control 
Titania, the jealous Oberon commands the trickster Puck to squeeze the
juice of a magical flower over her eyes. When she wakes up, she’ll fall in love 
with the first thing she sees. On his mission, Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over
the eyes of the napping Demetrius and Lysander, and transforms Bottom’s head
into that of a donkey for good measure. As eyes flicker open, a night of chaos commences that includes
broken hearts, mistaken identity, and transformations. Out of all the characters, Bottom probably
fares the best – when the bewitched Titania 
lays eyes on him, she calls on her fairies to lavish him 
with wine and treasures and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman 
off his feet: “pluck the wings from painted butterflies/ To fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes. Nod to him, elves, 
and do him courtesies.” While magic is the catalyst to the action, the play reflects the real drama 
of the things we do for love – and the nonsensical behavior 
of the people under its spell. The moon overlooks the action 
“like a silver bow,” signifying erratic behavior, 
the dark side of love, and the bewitching allure of a world 
where the usual rules don’t apply. Although the characters eventually 
come to their senses, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" 
raises the question of how much agency we have 
over our own daily lives. But it’s not the more realistically
rendered lovers, rulers or workers who have the last word, but the impish Puck who queries whether we
can ever truly trust what we see: If we shadows have offended, Think but this and all is mended: That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear.  And in so doing, he evokes the effect of entering into the 
magical world of great theatre that plays with the boundary between 
illusion and reality – and dramatizes the possibility 
that life is but a dream.

**Transcript**:
a group of youths sneak into the woods, where they take mind-altering substances, switch it up romantically, and brush up against creatures 
from another dimension. "A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream" sees 
Shakespeare get psychedelic – and the result is a treat in the 
theatre and on the page. First performed in the 1590's, this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works, filled with trickery, madness and magic. Set over the course of one night, Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace. The plot is structured around patterns of 
collision and dissolution, where characters from different worlds 
are thrown together and torn apart. Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock 
the characters’ self-obsession and question authority with a comic twist. The action is set in Ancient Greece, but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns. The magical setting of the woods at night disrupts the boundaries between 
separate groups, with bizarre results. Here, the bard plays with the rigid class 
system of his own time, taking three distinct groups
and turning their society upside-down in a world where no mortal is in control. The play opens with young Hermia raging at her father Egeus and 
Theseus, the King of Athens, who have forbidden her to marry 
her lover Lysander. Hermia has no interest in her father's 
choice for her of Demetrius – but her best friend Helena 
definitely does. Furious at their elders, Hermia and 
Lysander elope under cover of darkness, with Demetrius in hot pursuit. This is further complicated 
by Helena’s decision to follow them all into the woods,
in the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart. At this point, the woods are 
getting crowded, as the lovers are sharing the space 
with a group of “rude mechanicals”— a troupe of workers drunkenly rehearsing 
a play, led by the jovial Nick Bottom. Unbeknownst to them, the humans have 
entered into the world of the fairies. Despite their magical splendor, 
Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies, 
have their own romantic problems. Furious at his inability to control 
Titania, the jealous Oberon commands the trickster Puck to squeeze the
juice of a magical flower over her eyes. When she wakes up, she’ll fall in love 
with the first thing she sees. On his mission, Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over
the eyes of the napping Demetrius and Lysander, and transforms Bottom’s head
into that of a donkey for good measure. As eyes flicker open, a night of chaos commences that includes
broken hearts, mistaken identity, and transformations. Out of all the characters, Bottom probably
fares the best – when the bewitched Titania 
lays eyes on him, she calls on her fairies to lavish him 
with wine and treasures and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman 
off his feet: “pluck the wings from painted butterflies/ To fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes. Nod to him, elves, 
and do him courtesies.” While magic is the catalyst to the action, the play reflects the real drama 
of the things we do for love – and the nonsensical behavior 
of the people under its spell. The moon overlooks the action 
“like a silver bow,” signifying erratic behavior, 
the dark side of love, and the bewitching allure of a world 
where the usual rules don’t apply. Although the characters eventually 
come to their senses, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" 
raises the question of how much agency we have 
over our own daily lives. But it’s not the more realistically
rendered lovers, rulers or workers who have the last word, but the impish Puck who queries whether we
can ever truly trust what we see: If we shadows have offended, Think but this and all is mended: That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear.  And in so doing, he evokes the effect of entering into the 
magical world of great theatre that plays with the boundary between 
illusion and reality – and dramatizes the possibility 
that life is but a dream.

**Transcript**:
Billy Pilgrim can’t sleep because he knows aliens will arrive
to abduct him in one hour. He knows the aliens are coming because
he has become “unstuck” in time, causing him to experience
events out of chronological order. Over the course of Kurt Vonnegut’s 
Slaughterhouse-five, he hops back and forth between a childhood
trip to the Grand Canyon, his life as a middle-aged optometrist, his captivity in an intergalactic zoo, the humiliations he endured
as a war prisoner, and more. The title of Slaughterhouse-five and 
much of its source material came from Vonnegut’s own 
experiences in World War II. As a prisoner of war, he lived in a former
slaughterhouse in Dresden, where he took refuge in an 
underground meat locker while Allied forces bombed the city. When he and the other prisoners
finally emerged, they found Dresden utterly demolished. After the war, Vonnegut tried to 
make sense of human behavior by studying an unusual 
aspect of anthropology: the shapes of stories, which he insisted were just as interesting
as the shapes of pots or spearheads. To find the shape, he graphed the main 
character’s fortune from the beginning to the end of a story. The zany curves he generated revealed 
common types of fairy tales and myths that echo through many cultures. But this shape can be
the most interesting of all. In a story like this, it’s impossible to distinguish the 
character’s good fortune from the bad. Vonnegut thought this kind of story 
was the truest to real life, in which we are all the victims 
of a series of accidents, unable to predict how events 
will impact us long term. He found the tidy, satisfying arcs of 
many stories at odds with this reality, and he set out to explore the ambiguity between good and bad fortune
in his own work. When Vonnegut ditched clear-cut fortunes, he also abandoned
straightforward chronology. Instead of proceeding tidily from 
beginning to end, in his stories “All moments, past, present and future 
always have existed, always will exist.” Tralfamadorians, the aliens who crop up
in many of his books, see all moments at once. They “can see where each star has been
and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled
with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.” But although they can see all of time, they don’t try to change 
the course of events. While the Trafalmadorians may be at peace 
with their lack of agency, Vonnegut’s human characters are 
still getting used to it. In The Sirens of Titan, when they seek the meaning of life
in the vastness of the universe, they find nothing but “empty heroics, 
low comedy, and pointless death.” Then, from their vantage point within 
a “chrono-synclastic infundibulum,” a man and his dog see devastating 
futures for their earthly counterparts, but can’t change the course of events. Though there aren’t easy answers 
available, they eventually conclude that the purpose of life is “to love
whoever is around to be loved.” In Cat’s Cradle, Vonnegut’s characters 
turn to a different source of meaning: Bokonism, a religion based on harmless lies 
that all its adherents recognize as lies. Though they’re aware of Bokonism’s lies, they live their lives by 
these tenets anyway, and in so doing develop
some genuine hope. They join together in groups called 
Karasses, which consist of people we “find by accident but […] 
stick with by choice”— cosmically linked around
a shared purpose. These are not to be confused 
with Granfalloons, groups of people who appoint significance
to actually meaningless associations, like where you grew up, political 
parties, and even entire nations. Though he held a bleak view of the human 
condition, Vonnegut believed strongly that “we are all here to help each other get
through this thing, whatever it is." We might get pooped and demoralized, but Vonnegut interspersed 
his grim assessments with more than a few morsels of hope. His fictional alter ego, Kilgore Trout, 
supplied this parable: two yeast sat “discussing the
possible purposes of life as they ate sugar and suffocated 
in their own excrement. Because of their limited intelligence, they never came close to guessing 
that they were making champagne.” In spite of his insistence that we’re
all here to fart around, in spite of his deep concerns about 
the course of human existence, Vonnegut also advanced the possibility, 
however slim, that we might end up 
making something good. And if that isn’t nice, what is?

make sense of human behavior by studying an unusual 
aspect of anthropology: the shapes of stories, which he insisted were just as interesting
as the shapes of pots or spearheads. To find the shape, he graphed the main 
character’s fortune from the beginning to the end of a story. The zany curves he generated revealed 
common types of fairy tales and myths that echo through many cultures. But this shape can be
the most interesting of all. In a story like this, it’s impossible to distinguish the 
character’s good fortune from the bad. Vonnegut thought this kind of story 
was the truest to real life, in which we are all the victims 
of a series of accidents, unable to predict how events 
will impact us long term. He found the tidy, satisfying arcs of 
many stories at odds with this reality, and he set out to explore the ambiguity between good and bad fortune
in his own work. When Vonnegut ditched clear-cut fortunes, he also abandoned
straightforward chronology. Instead of proceeding tidily from 
beginning to end, in his stories “All moments, past, present and future 
always have existed, always will exist.” Tralfamadorians, the aliens who crop up
in many of his books, see all moments at once. They “can see where each star has been
and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled
with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.” But although they can see all of time, they don’t try to change 
the course of events. While the Trafalmadorians may be at peace 
with their lack of agency, Vonnegut’s human characters are 
still getting used to it. In The Sirens of Titan, when they seek the meaning of life
in the vastness of the universe, they find nothing but “empty heroics, 
low comedy, and pointless death.” Then, from their vantage point within 
a “chrono-synclastic infundibulum,” a man and his dog see devastating 
futures for their earthly counterparts, but can’t change the course of events. Though there aren’t easy answers 
available, they eventually conclude that the purpose of life is “to love
whoever is around to be loved.” In Cat’s Cradle, Vonnegut’s characters 
turn to a different source of meaning: Bokonism, a religion based on harmless lies 
that all its adherents recognize as lies. Though they’re aware of Bokonism’s lies, they live their lives by 
these tenets anyway, and in so doing develop
some genuine hope. They join together in groups called 
Karasses, which consist of people we “find by accident but […] 
stick with by choice”— cosmically linked around
a shared purpose. These are not to be confused 
with Granfalloons, groups of people who appoint significance
to actually meaningless associations, like where you grew up, political 
parties, and even entire nations. Though he held a bleak view of the human 
condition, Vonnegut believed strongly that “we are all here to help each other get
through this thing, whatever it is." We might get pooped and demoralized, but Vonnegut interspersed 
his grim assessments with more than a few morsels of hope. His fictional alter ego, Kilgore Trout, 
supplied this parable: two yeast sat “discussing the
possible purposes of life as they ate sugar and suffocated 
in their own excrement. Because of their limited intelligence, they never came close to guessing 
that they were making champagne.” In spite of his insistence that we’re
all here to fart around, in spite of his deep concerns about 
the course of human existence, Vonnegut also advanced the possibility, 
however slim, that we might end up 
making something good. And if that isn’t nice, what is?

**Transcript**:
Billy Pilgrim can’t sleep because he knows aliens will arrive
to abduct him in one hour. He knows the aliens are coming because
he has become “unstuck” in time, causing him to experience
events out of chronological order. Over the course of Kurt Vonnegut’s 
Slaughterhouse-five, he hops back and forth between a childhood
trip to the Grand Canyon, his life as a middle-aged optometrist, his captivity in an intergalactic zoo, the humiliations he endured
as a war prisoner, and more. The title of Slaughterhouse-five and 
much of its source material came from Vonnegut’s own 
experiences in World War II. As a prisoner of war, he lived in a former

**Transcript**:
The family of giants you work for is throwing a fancy dinner party, and they all want to look their best. But there’s a problem – the elder giant’s favorite 
shirt is wrinkled! To fix it, you’ll need to power up… the Giant Iron. The iron needs two giant 
batteries to work. You just had 4 working ones and 4 dead ones in separate piles, but it looks like the baby giant 
mixed them all up. You need to get the iron working 
and press the giant shirt, fast – or you’ll end up being the 
main course tonight! How can you test the batteries so that you’re guaranteed to get 
a working pair in 7 tries or less? Pause the video now if you want to 
figure it out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could, of course, take 
all eight batteries and begin testing the 28 
possible combinations. You might get lucky within 
the first few tries. But if you don’t, moving the giant 
batteries that many times will take way too long. You can’t rely on luck – you need to assume the worst 
possibility and plan accordingly. However, you don’t actually need 
to test every possible combination. Remember – there are four 
good batteries in total, meaning that any pile of six you choose will have at least two 
good batteries in it. That doesn’t help you right away, since testing all six batteries could 
still take as many as 15 tries. But it does give you 
a clue to the solution – dividing the batteries into smaller 
subsets narrows down the possible results. So instead of six batteries, let’s take any three. This group has a total of three 
possible combinations. Since both batteries have to be 
working for the iron to power up, a single failure can’t tell you whether 
both batteries are dead, or just one. But if all three combinations fail, then you’ll know this group has either 
one good battery, or none at all. Now you can set those three aside and repeat the process for 
another three batteries. You might get a match, but if every 
combination fails again, you’ll know this set can have 
no more than one good battery. That would leave only two 
batteries untried. Since there are four good 
batteries in total and you’ve only accounted for two so far, both of these remaining ones must be good. Dividing the batteries into 
sets of 3, 3, and 2 is guaranteed to get a working result 
in 7 tries or less, no matter what order 
you test the piles in. With no time to spare, 
the iron comes to life, and you manage to get the shirt 
flawlessly ironed. The pleased elder and his family show up 
to the party dressed to the nines … well, almost.

**Transcript**:
The family of giants you work for is throwing a fancy dinner party, and they all want to look their best. But there’s a problem – the elder giant’s favorite 
shirt is wrinkled! To fix it, you’ll need to power up… the Giant Iron. The iron needs two giant 
batteries to work. You just had 4 working ones and 4 dead ones in separate piles, but it looks like the baby giant 
mixed them all up. You need to get the iron working 
and press the giant shirt, fast – or you’ll end up being the 
main course tonight! How can you test the batteries so that you’re guaranteed to get 
a working pair in 7 tries or less? Pause the video now if you want to 
figure it out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could, of course, take 
all eight batteries and begin testing the 28 
possible combinations. You might get lucky within 
the first few tries. But if you don’t, moving the giant 
batteries that many times will take way too long. You can’t rely on luck – you need to assume the worst 
possibility and plan accordingly. However, you don’t actually need 
to test every possible combination. Remember – there are four 
good batteries in total, meaning that any pile of six you choose will have at least two 
good batteries in it. That doesn’t help you right away, since testing all six batteries could 
still take as many as 15 tries. But it does give you 
a clue to the solution – dividing the batteries into smaller 
subsets narrows down the possible results. So instead of six batteries, let’s take any three. This group has a total of three 
possible combinations. Since both batteries have to be 
working for the iron to power up, a single failure can’t tell you whether 
both batteries are dead, or just one. But if all three combinations fail, then you’ll know this group has either 
one good battery, or none at all. Now you can set those three aside and repeat the process for

dogs first originated is still a bone of contention. Why? Is the easiest to answer. Every continent is home to wild canids – like
Africa’s painted dogs or Asia’s doles, but thanks to genetic research we know modern
pups didn’t descend from those local species. Today’s domestic dogs all trace their
DNA back to ancient wolves. You may have heard that wolves and ancient
people were hunting buddies that used teamwork to run down bigger prey. That’s a nice story, but wolf packs can
hunt just fine on their own – and usually aren’t too big on sharing. Plus, early humans tended to kill off most
carnivorous competition. It’s most likely that humans didn’t adopt
dogs. Dogs adopted us. Any “wolves gone mild” that were tolerant
of humans could have scrounged our scraps. They didn’t need us, but our leftovers could
have made their lives easier. Today, about 85 percent of domestic dogs still
survive on our waste - no matter how many times we tell them “STAY OUT OF THE TRASH” But a tame wolf isn’t a dog, and scientists
are still trying to figure out when and where that change occurred. Studying living wolves tells us the line that
led to our pups is extinct today, but we can still find their footprints in modern dog
genomes. Looking at DNA in mitochondria tells us dogs
split from their wolf ancestors somewhere in Europe between 19 and 32 thousand years
ago, but whole genomes from dozens of living dogs put the split somewhere in South Asia
around 33,000 years ago. It’s tough to pin down because dog genes
have mixed so much. Fossils don’t tell the whole story either,
because bones alone can’t tell us when the thing that looked like a wolf started to act
like a dog. But combining the two, fossils and DNA, could give us some hints. DNA extracted from ancient dog fossils has
suggested a new story: the domestication split happened in two places, at least 12,000 years
ago. And then at some point, Eastern dogs followed
people west, and became the dominant ancestor of our canine compadres. Dogs became useful herders, sled pullers,
and guards – against predators AND neighboring human tribes. And in a pinch, they could have served as
an emergency food supply. Dogs probably saved us more times than we
can count. We’re paying them back – pups now have
access to insurance, healthcare, some even have more instagram followers than you and
me. From a wolf mold, we’ve crafted 340 or so
dog breeds, even a few weird ones. It’s hard to believe every domestic dog
is still part of the same species, one whose story is so tightly wound to our own, that
we still can’t quite tell where it begins. Stay! Staaaay. Curious.

**Transcript**:
About once every century, a massive star somewhere in our galaxy runs out of fuel. This happens after millions of years 
of heat and pressure have fused the star’s hydrogen into heavier elements like helium,
carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron. No longer able to produce sufficient 
energy to maintain its structure, it collapses under its own gravitational 
pressure and explodes in a supernova. The star shoots most of its 
innards into space, seeding the galaxy with heavy elements. But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves
behind might be even more remarkable: a ball of matter so dense that 
atomic electrons collapse from their quantum orbits 
into the depths of atomic nuclei. The death of that star 
is the birth of a neutron star: one of the densest known objects 
in the universe, and a laboratory for the strange physics 
of supercondensed matter. But what is a neutron star? Think of a compact ball inside of which 
protons and electrons fuse into neutrons and form a frictionless liquid 
called a superfluid— surrounded by a crust. This material is incredibly dense – the equivalent of the mass of a 
fully-loaded container ship squeezed into a human hair, or the mass of Mount Everest 
in a space of a sugar cube. Deeper in the crust, the neutron 
superfluid forms different phases that physicists call “nuclear pasta,” as it’s squeezed from lasagna 
to spaghetti-like shapes. The massive precursors to 
neutron stars often spin. When they collapse, stars that are typically millions of 
kilometers wide compress down to neutron stars that are
only about 25 kilometers across. But the original star’s angular 
momentum is preserved. So for the same reason that a figure 
skater’s spin accelerates when they bring in their arms, the neutron star spins much more 
rapidly than its parent. The fastest neutron star on record 
rotates over 700 times every second, which means that a point on its surface 
whirls through space at more than a fifth 
of the speed of light. Neutron stars also have the strongest 
magnetic field of any known object. This magnetic concentration
forms vortexes that radiate beams 
from the magnetic poles. Since the poles aren’t always aligned 
with the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink 
when viewed from Earth. We call those pulsars. The detection of one of these 
tantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly
discovered neutron stars in the first place. An aging neutron star’s furious rotation
slows over a period of billions of years as it radiates away its energy in the form
of electromagnetic and gravity waves. But not all neutron stars 
disappear so quietly. For example, we’ve observed binary systems where a neutron star 
co-orbits another star. A neutron star can feed on 
a lighter companion, gorging on its more 
loosely bound atmosphere before eventually collapsing
cataclysmically into a black hole. While many stars exist as binary systems, only a small percentage of those end up 
as neutron-star binaries, where two neutron stars circle each other 
in a waltz doomed to end as a merger. When they finally collide, they send 
gravity waves through space-time like ripples from a stone 
thrown into a calm lake. Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted this phenomenon over 100 years
ago, but it wasn't directly verified until 2017, when gravitational-wave observatories 
LIGO and VIRGO observed a neutron star collision. Other telescopes picked up a burst of 
gamma rays and a flash of light, and, later, x-rays and radio signals, 
all from the same impact. That became the most studied event 
in the history of astronomy. It yielded a treasure trove of data that’s helped pin down the speed 
of gravity, bolster important theories 
in astrophysics, and provide evidence for the origin 
of heavy elements like gold and platinum. Neutron stars haven’t given up 
all their secrets yet. LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded 
to detect more collisions. That’ll help us learn what else the spectacular demise of these dense, 
pulsating, spinning magnets can tell us about the universe.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
About once every century, a massive star somewhere in our galaxy runs out of fuel. This happens after millions of years 
of heat and pressure have fused the star’s hydrogen into heavier elements like helium,
carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron. No longer able to produce sufficient 
energy to maintain its structure, it collapses under its own gravitational 
pressure and explodes in a supernova. The star shoots most of its 
innards into space, seeding the galaxy with heavy elements. But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves
behind might be even more remarkable: a ball of matter so dense that 
atomic electrons collapse from their quantum orbits 
into the depths of atomic nuclei. The death of that star 
is the birth of a neutron star: one of the densest known objects 
in the universe, and a laboratory for the strange physics 
of supercondensed matter. But what is a neutron star? Think of a compact ball inside of which 
protons and electrons fuse into neutrons and form a frictionless liquid 
called a superfluid— surrounded by a crust. This material is incredibly dense – the equivalent of the mass of a 
fully-loaded container ship squeezed into a human hair, or the mass of Mount Everest 
in a space of a sugar cube. Deeper in the crust, the neutron 
superfluid forms different phases that physicists call “nuclear pasta,” as it’s squeezed from lasagna 
to spaghetti-like shapes. The massive precursors to 
neutron stars often spin. When they collapse, stars that are typically millions of 
kilometers wide compress down to neutron stars that are
only about 25 kilometers across. But the original star’s angular 
momentum is preserved. So for the same reason that a figure 
skater’s spin accelerates when they bring in their arms, the neutron star spins much more 
rapidly than its parent. The fastest neutron star on record 
rotates over 700 times every second, which means that a point on its surface 
whirls through space at more than a fifth 
of the speed of light. Neutron stars also have the strongest 
magnetic field of any known object. This magnetic concentration
forms vortexes that radiate beams 
from the magnetic poles. Since the poles aren’t always aligned 
with the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink 
when viewed from Earth. We call those pulsars. The detection of one of these 
tantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly
discovered neutron stars in the first place. An aging neutron star’s furious rotation
slows over a period of billions of years as it radiates away its energy in the form
of electromagnetic and gravity waves. But not all neutron stars 
disappear so quietly. For example, we’ve observed binary systems where a neutron star 
co-orbits another star. A neutron star can feed on 
a lighter companion, gorging on its more 
loosely bound atmosphere before eventually collapsing
cataclysmically into a black hole. While many stars exist as binary systems, only a small percentage of those end up 
as neutron-star binaries, where two neutron stars circle each other 
in a waltz doomed to end as a merger. When they finally collide, they send 
gravity waves through space-time like ripples from a stone 
thrown into a calm lake. Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted this phenomenon over 100 years
ago, but it wasn't directly verified until 2017, when gravitational-wave observatories 
LIGO and VIRGO observed a neutron star collision. Other telescopes picked up a burst of 
gamma rays and a flash of light, and, later, x-rays and radio signals, 
all from the same impact. That became the most studied event 
in the history of astronomy. It yielded a treasure trove of data that’s helped pin down the speed 
of gravity, bolster important theories 
in astrophysics, and provide evidence for the origin 
of heavy elements like gold and platinum. Neutron stars haven’t given up 
all their secrets yet. LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded 
to detect more collisions. That’ll help us learn what else the spectacular demise of these dense, 
pulsating, spinning magnets can tell us about the universe.
