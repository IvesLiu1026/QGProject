**Transcript**:
What does it mean for a country
to have a healthy economy? What does a healthy economy 
even look like? Does it look like this? What about like this? Economist Kate Raworth shared a
pretty interesting answer to this question on the TED Interview podcast. And it challenges an idea that most
economists take for granted. We live— particularly in the West, 
particularly in the last 150 years— in a society that has a very strong belief
that growth is the sign of progress. And to a certain extent, it’s true. We love to see our kids grow. We love to see nature growing in spring. Growth is a wonderful,
healthy phase of life. But in our economies, it’s like we’ve
turned to Peter Pan economics— the economy that never wanted to grow up. It wanted to grow and grow and grow
forever. And it becomes this permanent phase. But we already know, in our own bodies,
in our own lives, that there’s another side to this metaphor
of growth that we love so much. If I told you, my friend
had gone to the doctor, and the doctor told her she had a growth, that already feels completely different. Because in the space of our own bodies, we know that when something 
tries to grow endlessly within this healthy, dynamic living whole, it is a threat to the health of the whole, and we do everything we can to stop it. But when we step into our economies,
for some reason, we think that endless growth is progress. And we are now running
into severe problems because we are addicted to endless growth. Simon Kuznets, he was asked in the 1930s
by US Congress to come up, for the first time, with a single number 
to measure the output of the economy. America could say we produced so many tons
of steel and so many bags of grain— but can we add it all together? So they commissioned him 
to do this and he said, “Yes, I can. I can add it all together
in one number.” National income, what we now know as GDP—
but he gave it with a caveat. He said the welfare of a nation can
scarcely be known from this number, don’t mix it up with welfare, right? Because it tells us nothing about 
the unpaid caring work of parents, tells us nothing about the value
that’s created in communities, because that’s not priced, and it’s a measure of the flow 
of economic value. It tells us nothing about the
living world, the forests, the mines that get run down in order
to create this value. But the convenience, the temptation,
of this single number was so great that politicians sort of tucked it 
in their armpit and carried right on. And we ended up in a horse race
of pursuing GDP growth. The dream is that GDP can
keep on increasing, we can have increasing financial returns, but that we can decouple
from using Earth’s resources. We can use less carbon and less metals,
and minerals and plastics, and we can use less 
of the Earth’s land surface, and separate these two: 
ever rising GDP and falling resource use. It’s a fabulous dream; 
would that it would be true. We are at a time of climate emergency,
of ecosystem collapse. We need to radically reduce 
our use of Earth’s resources, and we're nowhere close to that. So I offer it as a compass for 21st
century prosperity. And this compass, silly though it sounds, it looks like a doughnut 
with the hole in the middle. So imagine from the center of it,
humanity’s use of Earth’s resources radiating out from the middle
of that picture. So in the hole, 
in the middle of the doughnut, that is the place where people 
don’t have enough resources to meet the essentials of life. It’s where people don’t have enough
food or health care, or education or housing or gender equality
or political voice or access to energy. And we want to leave nobody in that hole. We want to get everybody over a social
foundation of well-being, so all people on this planet can
lead lives of dignity and opportunity and community. And in low income countries, 
it absolutely makes sense, yes, let’s see the economy grow in ways 
that invest in health and education and transport for all. That was a very 20th century project. We're in the 21st century. We have Earth system scientists
who started looking at the impact we were having on the climate,
and the loss of soils and acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer,
and the collapse of species. And they said, hang on. We’ve been ignoring our planet. In the growing to meet human needs, 
we have ignored the fact that we are deeply dependent 
on this delicately balanced living planet. It’s the only one we know of out there. And when we use Earth’s resources 
in such a way that we begin to push ourselves beyond
the living capacities of this planet, we are literally undermining the life
supporting systems on which we depend. So, hang on, just as there’s 
an inner limit of resource use, and we call out poverty and deprivation, there’s an outer limit of humanity’s
resource use. That’s ecological degradation. And we are breaking down
this planet on which we depend. So there you get the doughnut,
you get the inside, which is leave nobody behind in the hole. But don’t overshoot the outer ring either. And so the shape of progress
is fundamentally changed. It’s no longer this ever rising line
exponential growth, that we hear about in the financial news 
all the time. It’s balance. To me, a source of real hope is 
that we deeply understand this at the level of our body. You go to the doctor, the doctor will say, have enough food, but not too much, 
enough water, oxygen, exercise, sleep, anything you like— 
have enough, but not too much. Our health lies in balance. And if we can take that metaphor 
from the human body to the planetary body, we give ourselves a cracking
chance of understanding the deep interdependence of our world.

in their armpit and carried right on. And we ended up in a horse race
of pursuing GDP growth. The dream is that GDP can
keep on increasing, we can have increasing financial returns, but that we can decouple
from using Earth’s resources. We can use less carbon and less metals,
and minerals and plastics, and we can use less 
of the Earth’s land surface, and separate these two: 
ever rising GDP and falling resource use. It’s a fabulous dream; 
would that it would be true. We are at a time of climate emergency,
of ecosystem collapse. We need to radically reduce 
our use of Earth’s resources, and we're nowhere close to that. So I offer it as a compass for 21st
century prosperity. And this compass, silly though it sounds, it looks like a doughnut 
with the hole in the middle. So imagine from the center of it,
humanity’s use of Earth’s resources radiating out from the middle
of that picture. So in the hole, 
in the middle of the doughnut, that is the place where people 
don’t have enough resources to meet the essentials of life. It’s where people don’t have enough
food or health care, or education or housing or gender equality
or political voice or access to energy. And we want to leave nobody in that hole. We want to get everybody over a social
foundation of well-being, so all people on this planet can
lead lives of dignity and opportunity and community. And in low income countries, 
it absolutely makes sense, yes, let’s see the economy grow in ways 
that invest in health and education and transport for all. That was a very 20th century project. We're in the 21st century. We have Earth system scientists
who started looking at the impact we were having on the climate,
and the loss of soils and acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer,
and the collapse of species. And they said, hang on. We’ve been ignoring our planet. In the growing to meet human needs, 
we have ignored the fact that we are deeply dependent 
on this delicately balanced living planet. It’s the only one we know of out there. And when we use Earth’s resources 
in such a way that we begin to push ourselves beyond
the living capacities of this planet, we are literally undermining the life
supporting systems on which we depend. So, hang on, just as there’s 
an inner limit of resource use, and we call out poverty and deprivation, there’s an outer limit of humanity’s
resource use. That’s ecological degradation. And we are breaking down
this planet on which we depend. So there you get the doughnut,
you get the inside, which is leave nobody behind in the hole. But don’t overshoot the outer ring either. And so the shape of progress
is fundamentally changed. It’s no longer this ever rising line
exponential growth, that we hear about in the financial news 
all the time. It’s balance. To me, a source of real hope is 
that we deeply understand this at the level of our body. You go to the doctor, the doctor will say, have enough food, but not too much, 
enough water, oxygen, exercise, sleep, anything you like— 
have enough, but not too much. Our health lies in balance. And if we can take that metaphor 
from the human body to the planetary body, we give ourselves a cracking
chance of understanding the deep interdependence of our world.

**Transcript**:
What does it mean for a country
to have a healthy economy? What does a healthy economy 
even look like? Does it look like this? What about like this? Economist Kate Raworth shared a
pretty interesting answer to this question on the TED Interview podcast. And it challenges an idea that most
economists take for granted. We live— particularly in the West, 
particularly in the last 150 years— in a society that has a very strong belief
that growth is the sign of progress. And to a certain extent, it’s true. We love to see our kids grow. We love to see nature growing in spring. Growth is a wonderful,
healthy phase of life. But in our economies, it’s like we’ve
turned to Peter Pan economics— the economy that never wanted to grow up. It wanted to grow and grow and grow
forever. And it becomes this permanent phase. But we already know, in our own bodies,
in our own lives, that there’s another side to this metaphor
of growth that we love so much. If I told you, my friend
had gone to the doctor, and the doctor told her she had a growth, that already feels completely different. Because in the space of our own bodies, we know that when something 
tries to grow endlessly within this healthy, dynamic living whole, it is a threat to the health of the whole, and we do everything we can to stop it. But when we step into our economies,
for some reason, we think that endless growth is progress. And we are now running
into severe problems because we are addicted to endless growth. Simon Kuznets, he was asked in the 1930s
by US Congress to come up, for the first time, with a single number 
to measure the output of the economy. America could say we produced so many tons
of steel and so many bags of grain— but can we add it all together? So they commissioned him 
to do this and he said, “Yes, I can. I can add it all together
in one number.” National income, what we now know as GDP—
but he gave it with a caveat. He said the welfare of a nation can
scarcely be known from this number, don’t mix it up with welfare, right? Because it tells us nothing about 
the unpaid caring work of parents, tells us nothing about the value
that’s created in communities, because that’s not priced, and it’s a measure of the flow 
of economic value. It tells us nothing about the
living world, the forests, the mines that get run down in order
to create this value. But the convenience, the temptation,
of this single number was so great that politicians sort of tucked it 
in their armpit and carried right on. And we ended up in a horse race
of pursuing GDP growth. The dream is that GDP can
keep on increasing, we can have increasing financial returns, but that we can decouple
from using Earth’s resources. We can use less carbon and less metals,
and minerals and plastics, and we can use less 
of the Earth’s land surface, and separate these two:

**Transcript**:
The year is 1656. Your body is wracked 
by violent chills. Your head pounds,
your muscles are too weak to sit up, and you feel like rancid, hard-boiled eggs are squeezing out of your neck 
and armpits. In your feverish state, you see 
a strange-looking man approach, his face obscured by a beak-like mask,
his body covered from head to toe. He examines you 
and even without seeing his face, you know the diagnosis: you have the plague. The plague stands out as one of the most 
terrifying and destructive diseases in human history. It swept across large parts of Afro-
Eurasia in three separate pandemics starting in the 6th, 14th,
and 19th centuries; killed tens of millions of people, and had— in the best of cases— 
about a 40% survival rate. The European plague doctor, with his
beaked mask and wizard-like robes, is one of the images most popularly
associated with plague today. He’s often found in books and films 
about the 14th century pandemic known as the Black Death. The only problem is
that’s about as accurate as placing a modern surgeon at the court
of Louis the 14th in Versailles. The confusion is understandable though— the Black Death had several aftershocks, including a series of devastating
outbreaks in Western Europe during the 17th century. This is when the iconic plague doctor
actually emerged on the scene. First described in the early 17th century, the outfit consisted of a hood 
with crystal eyepieces and a beak filled with a pungent 
combination of herbs and compounds. This could include cinnamon, pepper,
turpentine, roast copper, and powdered viper flesh. This recipe was inspired by the famed
2nd century Greco-Roman physician Galen, and was thought to ward off poisoned air
known as miasma. People believed this bad air
spread plague after emanating from swamps and sources of decay, such as dead plants or animal carcasses. In earlier centuries, doctors across
Europe carried metal pomanders filled with similar mixtures, and it’s possible that the beak evolved
as a hands-free alternative. The rest of the costume, which included 
an oiled leather robe, boots and gloves, acted as kind of an early hazmat suit, likely designed to block miasma 
from entering through the skin’s pores. While this shows some basic understanding
that plague spread from one place to another, these doctors couldn’t know that,
in most cases, the true culprit was a tiny flea 
transmitting the bacteria, Yersinia pestis, 
from one person or animal to another. It’s possible that the plague doctor’s
outfit may have provided some unintentional protection 
from flea bites. However, not enough information
survives to know whether the costumed doctors fared any better than
their ordinarily robed counterparts. It's no surprise that this bizarre getup
has captured popular imagination, despite the fact that its use was limited
to a few places in Italy and France during the 17th and early 18th centuries. Even at the time, it was viewed
with macabre fascination and occasionally used to mock
the ineffective and corrupt practices of some physicians. Until the 20th century, there was 
no effective treatment for the plague, but that didn’t stop doctors— 
costumed or not— from trying. They consulted the works of earlier
physicians for guidance, did what they could to fend off miasma, and prescribed a variety 
of concoctions and antidotes. They also relied on pre-modern
medical mainstays. These could include bloodletting, which involved draining (sometimes 
concerningly large amounts of) blood in an attempt to remove poison 
or restore the body’s natural balance. Or cupping, where the rim 
of a heated glass was placed over swollen lymph nodes 
in hopes of making them burst sooner— a sign, when it occurred naturally,
that a plague patient was on the mend. Or— perhaps most painfully—
cautery, which involved lancing the lymph nodes
with a red-hot poker to release the blackened pus within. A lot has changed since their times. Modern medicine has given us the means
to quickly identify bacterial as well as viral threats and to effectively mobilize against them. We also have access to technologies
like test kits, masks to deter the spread 
of respiratory viruses, and vaccines; and we conduct robust trials to make
sure they’re safe and effective. But some things don’t change: we still depend on the courage
and compassion of medical professionals who voluntarily risk their lives against an invisible attacker to help
and comfort those who need it most.

**Transcript**:
The year is 1656. Your body is wracked 
by violent chills. Your head pounds,
your muscles are too weak to sit up, and you feel like rancid, hard-boiled eggs are squeezing out of your neck 
and armpits. In your feverish state, you see 
a strange-looking man approach, his face obscured by a beak-like mask,
his body covered from head to toe. He examines you 
and even without seeing his face, you know the diagnosis: you have the plague. The plague stands out as one of the most 
terrifying and destructive diseases in human history. It swept across large parts of Afro-
Eurasia in three separate pandemics starting in the 6th, 14th,
and 19th centuries; killed tens of millions of people, and had— in the best of cases— 
about a 40% survival rate. The European plague doctor, with his
beaked mask and wizard-like robes, is one of the images most popularly
associated with plague today. He’s often found in books and films 
about the 14th century pandemic known as the Black Death. The only problem is
that’s about as accurate as placing a modern surgeon at the court
of Louis the 14th in Versailles. The confusion is understandable though— the Black Death had several aftershocks, including a series of devastating
outbreaks in Western Europe during the 17th century. This is when the iconic plague doctor
actually emerged on the scene. First described in the early 17th century, the outfit consisted of a hood 
with crystal eyepieces and a beak filled with a pungent 
combination of herbs and compounds. This could include cinnamon, pepper,
turpentine, roast copper, and powdered viper flesh. This recipe was inspired by the famed
2nd century Greco-Roman physician Galen, and was thought to ward off poisoned air
known as miasma. People believed this bad air
spread plague after emanating from swamps and sources of decay, such as dead plants or animal carcasses. In earlier centuries, doctors across
Europe carried metal pomanders filled with similar mixtures, and it’s possible that the beak evolved
as a hands-free alternative. The rest of the costume, which included 
an oiled leather robe, boots and gloves, acted as kind of an early hazmat suit, likely designed to block miasma 
from entering through the skin’s pores. While this shows some basic understanding
that plague spread from one place to another, these doctors couldn’t know that,
in most cases, the true culprit was a tiny flea 
transmitting the bacteria, Yersinia pestis, 
from one person or animal to another. It’s possible that the plague doctor’s
outfit may have provided some unintentional protection 
from flea bites. However, not enough information
survives to know whether the costumed doctors fared any better than
their ordinarily robed counterparts. It's no surprise that this bizarre getup
has captured popular imagination, despite the fact that its use was limited
to a few places in Italy and France during the 17th and early 18th centuries. Even at the time, it was viewed
with macabre fascination and occasionally used to mock
the ineffective and corrupt practices of some physicians. Until the 20th century, there was 
no effective treatment for the plague, but that didn’t stop doctors— 
costumed or not— from trying. They consulted the works of earlier
physicians for guidance, did what they could to fend off miasma, and prescribed a variety 
of concoctions and antidotes. They also relied on pre-modern
medical mainstays. These could include bloodletting, which involved draining (sometimes 
concerningly large amounts of) blood in an attempt to remove poison 
or restore the body’s natural balance. Or cupping, where the rim 
of a heated glass was placed over swollen lymph nodes 
in hopes of making them burst sooner— a sign, when it occurred naturally,
that a plague patient was on the mend. Or— perhaps most painfully—
cautery, which involved lancing the lymph nodes
with a red-hot poker to release the blackened pus within. A lot has changed since their times. Modern medicine has given us the means
to quickly identify bacterial as well as viral threats and to effectively mobilize against them. We also have access to technologies
like test kits, masks to deter the spread 
of respiratory viruses, and vaccines; and we conduct robust trials to make
sure they’re safe and effective. But some things don’t change: we still depend on the courage
and compassion of medical professionals who voluntarily risk their lives against an invisible attacker to help
and comfort those who need it most.

**Transcript**:
In the years before World War Two, a pair of brothers worked together
as shoemakers in the German town of Herzogenaurach. But during the war, the siblings
had a terrible argument— a fight so explosive it split
the family business in two. At first, the feud only infected 
their newly competing personnel. But over the coming years, this disagreement divided
all of Herzogenaurach. Residents became fiercely
loyal to one brand of shoe. Local businesses chose sides and 
marriage across lines was discouraged. Herzogenaurach eventually became 
known as “the town of bent necks” because its residents looked down 
to ensure they were interacting with members of their group. But could such a serious divide
really be about shoes? Doesn’t it take more significant 
cultural differences to produce this degree of conflict? To answer this question, we can turn 
to social psychologist Henri Tajfel and his collaborators 
at the University of Bristol. This team developed 
the minimal group paradigm, a methodology designed to investigate the minimal conditions required 
to turn people against each other. Their plan was to gather participants 
without the usual factors that lead to hostility, such as religious, ethnic, 
gender, or other cultural differences. Then, they would split into groups, and run them through scenarios
that added one variable at a time to see what stirred up conflict. But first, they needed
a control condition— a pair of groups without any group bias. The researchers told participants
they were being grouped based on their ability to estimate things
correctly or incorrectly; but in reality, 
the groups were totally random. Since the researchers ensured none
of the participants interacted, no one could form any judgments
or personal bonds. Then everyone was given resources
to distribute. Each participant was free to give
resources to members of either group, and importantly, everything was anonymous. So whatever a participant decided, it had no impact on how many resources
they personally would receive. With all the ingredients 
for discrimination removed and no reason for competition
over resources, the scientists assumed this would
make a conflict-free baseline for further research. But even in these groups, where membership was only defined 
by a perceived similarity in possessing an arbitrary skill, individuals still showed in-group bias. They consistently gave more to members
of their own group than the out-group. Later, research went even further, informing participants that the only thing
determining their group membership was a coin flip. But group bias still occurred. The minimal groups of “us” and “them”
were enough. So, in the absence of stereotypes, 
resource conflicts and status differences, what was left? What could possibly account for people 
showing clear preferences for the most temporary and meaningless
of groups? The answer that came to Tajfel 
and his colleagues was social identity. People regularly use group membership 
to help determine their sense of identity. And these minimal group experiments
suggested that simply being categorized as part of a group is enough to link 
that group to a person’s sense of self. Then, in an effort to create
a meaningful identity, participants allocated more resources
to their in-group than the out-group— pursuing their group's interests despite
no clear benefit to themselves as individuals. Variants of these experiments have 
been conducted around the globe, examining how a shared sense 
of “us” can affect our attention, perception, memory, and emotions. The mental processes
behind minimal group distinctions appear to be the same as many of those
that underlie real group identities. So it is possible that these seemingly
insignificant differences can harden into much more serious divides. That said, minimal groups don't
always drive people apart. Bringing individuals together 
in a new group can temporarily help people
overcome entrenched biases. However, these positive effects are easily
negated by external factors that reinforce existing group identities. Ultimately, the psychology of groups
is part of the human condition, and our tendency towards in-group bias
is an undeniable part of that. So it's up to all of us to make
our groups and ourselves as inclusive of others as possible.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as the formation of calcium carbonate, mollusks, and nacre, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to social psychology and the minimal group paradigm.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to provide an index, I would say -1 or "No match" would be the most accurate response in this case.

**Transcript**:
In the years before World War Two, a pair of brothers worked together
as shoemakers in the German town of Herzogenaurach. But during the war, the siblings
had a terrible argument— a fight so explosive it split
the family business in two. At first, the feud only infected 
their newly competing personnel. But over the coming years, this disagreement divided
all of Herzogenaurach. Residents became fiercely
loyal to one brand of shoe. Local businesses chose sides and 
marriage across lines was discouraged. Herzogenaurach eventually became 
known as “the town of bent necks” because its residents looked down 
to ensure they were interacting with members of their group. But could such a serious divide
really be about shoes? Doesn’t it take more significant 
cultural differences to produce this degree of conflict? To answer this question, we can turn 
to social psychologist Henri Tajfel and his collaborators 
at the University of Bristol. This team developed 
the minimal group paradigm, a methodology designed to investigate the minimal conditions required 
to turn people against each other. Their plan was to gather participants 
without the usual factors that lead to hostility, such as religious, ethnic, 
gender, or other cultural differences. Then, they would split into groups, and run them through scenarios
that added one variable at a time to see what stirred up conflict. But first, they needed
a control condition— a pair of groups without any group bias. The researchers told participants
they were being grouped based on their ability to estimate things
correctly or incorrectly; but in reality, 
the groups were totally random. Since the researchers ensured none
of the participants interacted, no one could form any judgments
or personal bonds. Then everyone was given resources
to distribute. Each participant was free to give
resources to members of either group, and importantly, everything was anonymous. So whatever a participant decided, it had no impact on how many resources
they personally would receive. With all the ingredients 
for discrimination removed and no reason for competition
over resources, the scientists assumed this would
make a conflict-free baseline for further research. But even in these groups, where membership was only defined 
by a perceived similarity in possessing an arbitrary skill, individuals still showed in-group bias. They consistently gave more to members
of their own group than the out-group. Later, research went even further, informing participants that the only thing
determining their group membership was a coin flip. But group bias still occurred. The minimal groups of “us” and “them”
were enough. So, in the absence of stereotypes, 
resource conflicts and status differences, what was left? What could possibly account for people 
showing clear preferences for the most temporary and meaningless
of groups? The answer that came to Tajfel 
and his colleagues was social identity. People regularly use group membership 
to help determine their sense of identity. And these minimal group experiments
suggested that simply being categorized as part of a group is enough to link 
that group to a person’s sense of self. Then, in an effort to create
a meaningful identity, participants allocated more resources
to their in-group than the out-group— pursuing their group's interests despite
no clear benefit to themselves as individuals. Variants of these experiments have 
been conducted around the globe, examining how a shared sense 
of “us” can affect our attention, perception, memory, and emotions. The mental processes
behind minimal group distinctions appear to be the same as many of those
that underlie real group identities. So it is possible that these seemingly
insignificant differences can harden into much more serious divides. That said, minimal groups don't
always drive people apart. Bringing individuals together 
in a new group can temporarily help people
overcome entrenched biases. However, these positive effects are easily
negated by external factors that reinforce existing group identities. Ultimately, the psychology of groups
is part of the human condition, and our tendency towards in-group bias
is an undeniable part of that. So it's up to all of us to make
our groups and ourselves as inclusive of others as possible.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the formation of calcium carbonate and nacre in mollusks.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in terms of question structure and intent, I would choose Question 2. This question asks about the contribution of the Earth's crust to the formation of calcium carbonate, and it involves a process of elimination to arrive at the correct answer.

That being said, I must emphasize that Question 2 is not a good match for the ground truth MCQ, as it deals with a completely different topic and does not involve deception or group identity.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ, but if I had to choose one, it would be:

Index: None (or 2, with the caveat that it's not a good match)

Please note that the generated MCQs seem to be unrelated to the transcript and the ground truth MCQ, and it's not possible to find a good match.

**Transcript**:
In the years before World War Two, a pair of brothers worked together
as shoemakers in the German town of Herzogenaurach. But during the war, the siblings
had a terrible argument— a fight so explosive it split
the family business in two. At first, the feud only infected 
their newly competing personnel. But over the coming years, this disagreement divided
all of Herzogenaurach. Residents became fiercely
loyal to one brand of shoe. Local businesses chose sides and 
marriage across lines was discouraged. Herzogenaurach eventually became 
known as “the town of bent necks” because its residents looked down 
to ensure they were interacting with members of their group. But could such a serious divide
really be about shoes? Doesn’t it take more significant 
cultural differences to produce this degree of conflict? To answer this question, we can turn 
to social psychologist Henri Tajfel and his collaborators 
at the University of Bristol. This team developed 
the minimal group paradigm, a methodology designed to investigate the minimal conditions required 
to turn people against each other. Their plan was to gather participants 
without the usual factors that lead to hostility, such as religious, ethnic, 
gender, or other cultural differences. Then, they would split into groups, and run them through scenarios
that added one variable at a time to see what stirred up conflict. But first, they needed
a control condition— a pair of groups without any group bias. The researchers told participants
they were being grouped based on their ability to estimate things
correctly or incorrectly; but in reality, 
the groups were totally random. Since the researchers ensured none
of the participants interacted, no one could form any judgments
or personal bonds. Then everyone was given resources
to distribute. Each participant was free to give
resources to members of either group, and importantly, everything was anonymous. So whatever a participant decided, it had no impact on how many resources
they personally would receive. With all the ingredients 
for discrimination removed and no reason for competition
over resources, the scientists assumed this would
make a conflict-free baseline for further research. But even in these groups, where membership was only defined 
by a perceived similarity in possessing an arbitrary skill, individuals still showed in-group bias. They consistently gave more to members
of their own group than the out-group. Later, research went even further, informing participants that the only thing
determining their group membership was a coin flip. But group bias still occurred. The minimal groups of “us” and “them”
were enough. So, in the absence of stereotypes, 
resource conflicts and status differences, what was left? What could possibly account for people 
showing clear preferences for the most temporary and meaningless
of groups? The answer that came to Tajfel 
and his colleagues was social identity. People regularly use group membership 
to help determine their sense of identity. And these minimal group experiments
suggested that simply being categorized as part of a group is enough to link 
that group to a person’s sense of self. Then, in an effort to create
a meaningful identity, participants allocated more resources
to their in-group than the out-group— pursuing their group's interests despite
no clear benefit to themselves as individuals. Variants of these experiments have 
been conducted around the globe, examining how a shared sense 
of “us” can affect our attention, perception, memory, and emotions. The mental processes
behind minimal group distinctions appear to be the same as many of those
that underlie real group identities. So it is possible that these seemingly
insignificant differences can harden into much more serious divides. That said, minimal groups don't
always drive people apart. Bringing individuals together 
in a new group can temporarily help people
overcome entrenched biases. However, these positive effects are easily
negated by external factors that reinforce existing group identities. Ultimately, the psychology of groups
is part of the human condition, and our tendency towards in-group bias
is an undeniable part of that. So it's up to all of us to make
our groups and ourselves as inclusive of others as possible.

**Transcript**:
While most people wouldn’t consider
the crusty exterior of an oyster to be particularly beautiful, opening up this craggy case might reveal
an exquisite jewel nestled within. Yet, despite their iridescent colors
and smooth shapes, pearls are actually made 
of the exact same material as the shell that surrounds them. Pearls, urchin spines, the shells 
of mussels, snails and clams, even coral— all these structures are made 
out of the same chemical compound: calcium carbonate. So, how does this single ingredient form
such a vast array of materials? Calcium carbonate, or CaCO3, 
is common on land, and even more bountiful in the sea. The Earth’s crust is rich in calcium, and over millennia these deposits 
have seeped into rivers and oceans. This is especially true 
near hydrothermal vents, where hot seawater mingles 
with calcium rich basalts. Meanwhile, when carbon dioxide in the air
interacts with seawater it eventually produces
dissolved carbonate. Every year, the ocean absorbs roughly
one third of our carbon dioxide emissions, adding huge quantities of carbonate
into the water. It’s no surprise that sea creatures have
made use of these abundant compounds, but the way calcium and carbonate are
woven together into various shapes is surprisingly artful. Let’s return to the humble oyster. Like many aquatic mollusks,
oysters start life as exposed larvae, and quickly get to work building
a protective shell. First, an organ called the mantle secretes
an organic matrix of proteins and other molecules 
to construct a scaffold. Then, the oyster filters the seawater, drawing out calcium and carbonate to
combine them into its building material. It lays this material over the scaffold, which is covered in charged proteins
that attract and guide the calcium carbonate molecules
into layers. The specific arrangement of these protein
scaffolds depends on the mollusk species and their environment, accounting for their vast diversity 
of shell shapes, sizes, and colors. Mollusks carefully control all components 
of their calcium carbonate creations— even manipulating CaCO3 
at the molecular level. Using special proteins, mollusks can produce 
two crystal structures out of CaCO3: calcite and aragonite. Both of these compounds have 
the same chemical composition, but different qualities due to the way
their crystal lattices are arranged. Calcite is the more stable of the two 
and less prone to dissolving over time, so most mollusk shells have 
a sturdy outer layer of calcite. As the slightly more soluble molecule, aragonite can better adapt 
to more or less acidic environments. So most mollusk shells have 
an interior layer of aragonite to maintain their internal pH level. But one form of aragonite is stronger
and more versatile than the rest: nacre. Mollusks make this special material
by placing successive layers of aragonite interspersed with proteins. These layers are stacked
like hexagonal bricks, each surrounded by other organic material
that directs their orientation. The uniform layering and brick-like
structure of nacre is key to its signature iridescence. The layers are similar in thickness 
to the wavelength of visible light, so the light reflecting 
from its interior surface interferes with the light reflecting 
from the outer surface. When particles of light strike the nacre, they bounce around its multilayered 
crystalline structure in a cascade of shifting rainbows. But nacre isn’t just pretty— it’s one of the strongest and lightest
biomaterials we know of. And it's not just oysters that produce it. In fact, numerous mollusk
species deploy nacre as one of their primary
defense mechanisms. If an intruding parasite or even a stray
particle of sand irritates the mantle, the mollusk will coat the offender 
in nacre-producing cells to form what’s known as a pearl sac. These cells wrap the threat in layers 
of proteins and aragonite until eventually the cocoon 
completely absorbs the invader— dissolving the threat into an opalescent 
sphere of nacre. This defense mechanism is our leading
theory for mollusks making pearls; transforming everyday intruders
into timeless treasures.

**Transcript**:
While most people wouldn’t consider
the crusty exterior of an oyster to be particularly beautiful, opening up this craggy case might reveal
an exquisite jewel nestled within. Yet, despite their iridescent colors
and smooth shapes, pearls are actually made 
of the exact same material as the shell that surrounds them. Pearls, urchin spines, the shells 
of mussels, snails and clams, even coral— all these structures are made 
out of the same chemical compound: calcium carbonate. So, how does this single ingredient form
such a vast array of materials? Calcium carbonate, or CaCO3, 
is common on land, and even more bountiful in the sea. The Earth’s crust is rich in calcium, and over millennia these deposits 
have seeped into rivers and oceans. This is especially true 
near hydrothermal vents, where hot seawater mingles 
with calcium rich basalts. Meanwhile, when carbon dioxide in the air
interacts with seawater it eventually produces
dissolved carbonate. Every year, the ocean absorbs roughly
one third of our carbon dioxide emissions, adding huge quantities of carbonate
into the water. It’s no surprise that sea creatures have
made use of these abundant compounds, but the way calcium and carbonate are
woven together into various shapes is surprisingly artful. Let’s return to the humble oyster. Like many aquatic mollusks,
oysters start life as exposed larvae, and quickly get to work building
a protective shell. First, an organ called the mantle secretes
an organic matrix of proteins and other molecules 
to construct a scaffold. Then, the oyster filters the seawater, drawing out calcium and carbonate to
combine them into its building material. It lays this material over the scaffold, which is covered in charged proteins
that attract and guide the calcium carbonate molecules
into layers. The specific arrangement of these protein
scaffolds depends on the mollusk species and their environment, accounting for their vast diversity 
of shell shapes, sizes, and colors. Mollusks carefully control all components 
of their calcium carbonate creations— even manipulating CaCO3 
at the molecular level. Using special proteins, mollusks can produce 
two crystal structures out of CaCO3: calcite and aragonite. Both of these compounds have 
the same chemical composition, but different qualities due to the way
their crystal lattices are arranged. Calcite is the more stable of the two 
and less prone to dissolving over time, so most mollusk shells have 
a sturdy outer layer of calcite. As the slightly more soluble molecule, aragonite can better adapt 
to more or less acidic environments. So most mollusk shells have 
an interior layer of aragonite to maintain their internal pH level. But one form of aragonite is stronger
and more versatile than the rest: nacre. Mollusks make this special material
by placing successive layers of aragonite interspersed with proteins. These layers are stacked
like hexagonal bricks, each surrounded by other organic material
that directs their orientation. The uniform layering and brick-like
structure of nacre is key to its signature iridescence. The layers are similar in thickness 
to the wavelength of visible light, so the light reflecting 
from its interior surface interferes with the light reflecting 
from the outer surface. When particles of light strike the nacre, they bounce around its multilayered 
crystalline structure in a cascade of shifting rainbows. But nacre isn’t just pretty— it’s one of the strongest and lightest
biomaterials we know of. And it's not just oysters that produce it. In fact, numerous mollusk
species deploy nacre as one of their primary
defense mechanisms. If an intruding parasite or even a stray
particle of sand irritates the mantle, the mollusk will coat the offender 
in nacre-producing cells to form what’s known as a pearl sac. These cells wrap the threat in layers 
of proteins and aragonite until eventually the cocoon 
completely absorbs the invader— dissolving the threat into an opalescent 
sphere of nacre. This defense mechanism is our leading
theory for mollusks making pearls; transforming everyday intruders
into timeless treasures.

**Transcript**:
The Black Death. The 1918 Flu Pandemic. COVID-19. We tend to think of these catastrophic, 
world-changing pandemics as very unlikely events. But between 1980 and 2020, at least three diseases emerged 
that caused global pandemics. COVID-19, yes, but also 
the 2009 swine flu and HIV/AIDS. Disease outbreaks are surprisingly common. Over the past four centuries, the longest stretch of time 
without a documented outbreak that killed at least 10,000 people
was just four years. As bad as these smaller outbreaks are, they’re far less deadly than
a COVID-19-level pandemic. In fact, many people born after 
the 1918 flu lived their entire lives without experiencing
a similar world-changing pandemic. What’s the probability that you do, too? There are several ways 
to answer this question. You could look at history. A team of scientists and engineers 
who took this approach catalogued all documented epidemics 
and pandemics between 1600 and 1950. They used that data to do two things. First, to graph the likelihood 
that an outbreak of any size pops up somewhere in the world 
over a set period of time. And second, to estimate the likelihood
that that outbreak would get large enough to kill a certain percentage
of the world's population. This graph shows that while huge
pandemics are unlikely, they're not that unlikely. The team used these two distributions
to estimate that the risk of a COVID-19-level pandemic 
is about 0.5% per year, and could be as high as 1.4% if new diseases emerge 
more frequently in the future. And we’ll come back to those numbers, but first, let’s look at another way
to estimate the likelihood of a future pandemic: modeling one from the ground up. For most pandemics to happen, a pathogen,
which is a microbe that can cause disease, has to spill over from its normal host by
making contact with and infecting a human. Then, the pathogen has to spread widely, crossing international boundaries
and infecting lots of people. Many variables determine whether a given
spillover event becomes a pandemic. For example, the type of pathogen, 
how often humans come into close contact with its animal reservoir, 
existing immunity, and so on. Viruses are prime candidates 
to cause the next big pandemic. Scientists estimate that there are about
1.7 million as-yet-undiscovered viruses that currently infect mammals and birds, and that roughly 40% of these have the
potential to spill over and infect humans. A team of scientists built a model
using this information, as well as data about the global
population, air travel networks, how people move around in communities,
country preparedness levels, and how people might respond to pandemics. The model generated hundreds of thousands
of virtual pandemics. The scientists then used 
this catalog to estimate that the probability of another 
COVID-19-level pandemic is 2.5 to 3.3% per year. To get a sense of how these risks
play out over a lifetime, let’s pick a value roughly in the middle
of all these estimates: 2%. Now let’s build what’s called 
a probability tree diagram to model all possible scenarios. The first branch of the tree
represents the first year: there’s a 2% probability of experiencing
a COVID-19-level pandemic, which means there’s a 98% probability 
of not experiencing one. Second branch, same thing, Third branch, same. And so on, 72 more times. There is only one path that results
in a fully pandemic-free lifetime: 98%, or 0.98,
multiplied by itself 75 times, which comes out to roughly 22%. So the likelihood of living through 
at least one more COVID 19-level-pandemic in the next 75 years 
is 100 minus 22%, or 78%. 78%! If we use the most optimistic
yearly estimate— 0.5%— the lifetime probability drops to 31%. If we use the most pessimistic one,
it jumps to 92%. Even 31% is too high to ignore; even if we get lucky, 
future generations might not. Also, pandemics are usually
random, independent events: so even if the yearly probability 
of a COVID-19-level pandemic is 1%, we could absolutely get another
one in ten years. The good news is we now have tools 
that make pandemics less destructive. Scientists estimated that early warning
systems, contact tracing, social distancing, 
and other public health measures saved over a million lives 
in just the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, not to mention the millions
of lives saved by vaccines. One day, another pandemic
will sweep the globe. But we can work to make that day
less likely to be tomorrow. We can reduce the risk
of spillover events, and we can contain spillovers
that do happen so they don’t become full-blown pandemics. Imagine how the future might
look if we interacted with the animal world more carefully, and if we had well-funded, open-access 
global disease monitoring programs, AI-powered contact tracing
and isolation measures, universal vaccines, 
next-generation antiviral drugs, and other tech we haven't even thought of. It’s in our power to change 
these probabilities. So, we have a choice: we could do nothing
and hope we get lucky. Or we could take the threat 
seriously enough that it becomes a self-defeating prophecy. Which future would you rather live in?

1.7 million as-yet-undiscovered viruses that currently infect mammals and birds, and that roughly 40% of these have the
potential to spill over and infect humans. A team of scientists built a model
using this information, as well as data about the global
population, air travel networks, how people move around in communities,
country preparedness levels, and how people might respond to pandemics. The model generated hundreds of thousands
of virtual pandemics. The scientists then used 
this catalog to estimate that the probability of another 
COVID-19-level pandemic is 2.5 to 3.3% per year. To get a sense of how these risks
play out over a lifetime, let’s pick a value roughly in the middle
of all these estimates: 2%. Now let’s build what’s called 
a probability tree diagram to model all possible scenarios. The first branch of the tree
represents the first year: there’s a 2% probability of experiencing
a COVID-19-level pandemic, which means there’s a 98% probability 
of not experiencing one. Second branch, same thing, Third branch, same. And so on, 72 more times. There is only one path that results
in a fully pandemic-free lifetime: 98%, or 0.98,
multiplied by itself 75 times, which comes out to roughly 22%. So the likelihood of living through 
at least one more COVID 19-level-pandemic in the next 75 years 
is 100 minus 22%, or 78%. 78%! If we use the most optimistic
yearly estimate— 0.5%— the lifetime probability drops to 31%. If we use the most pessimistic one,
it jumps to 92%. Even 31% is too high to ignore; even if we get lucky, 
future generations might not. Also, pandemics are usually
random, independent events: so even if the yearly probability 
of a COVID-19-level pandemic is 1%, we could absolutely get another
one in ten years. The good news is we now have tools 
that make pandemics less destructive. Scientists estimated that early warning
systems, contact tracing, social distancing, 
and other public health measures saved over a million lives 
in just the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, not to mention the millions
of lives saved by vaccines. One day, another pandemic
will sweep the globe. But we can work to make that day
less likely to be tomorrow. We can reduce the risk
of spillover events, and we can contain spillovers
that do happen so they don’t become full-blown pandemics. Imagine how the future might
look if we interacted with the animal world more carefully, and if we had well-funded, open-access 
global disease monitoring programs, AI-powered contact tracing
and isolation measures, universal vaccines, 
next-generation antiviral drugs, and other tech we haven't even thought of. It’s in our power to change 
these probabilities. So, we have a choice: we could do nothing
and hope we get lucky. Or we could take the threat 
seriously enough that it becomes a self-defeating prophecy. Which future would you rather live in?

**Transcript**:
The Black Death. The 1918 Flu Pandemic. COVID-19. We tend to think of these catastrophic, 
world-changing pandemics as very unlikely events. But between 1980 and 2020, at least three diseases emerged 
that caused global pandemics. COVID-19, yes, but also 
the 2009 swine flu and HIV/AIDS. Disease outbreaks are surprisingly common. Over the past four centuries, the longest stretch of time 
without a documented outbreak that killed at least 10,000 people
was just four years. As bad as these smaller outbreaks are, they’re far less deadly than
a COVID-19-level pandemic. In fact, many people born after 
the 1918 flu lived their entire lives without experiencing
a similar world-changing pandemic. What’s the probability that you do, too? There are several ways 
to answer this question. You could look at history. A team of scientists and engineers 
who took this approach catalogued all documented epidemics 
and pandemics between 1600 and 1950. They used that data to do two things. First, to graph the likelihood 
that an outbreak of any size pops up somewhere in the world 
over a set period of time. And second, to estimate the likelihood
that that outbreak would get large enough to kill a certain percentage
of the world's population. This graph shows that while huge
pandemics are unlikely, they're not that unlikely. The team used these two distributions
to estimate that the risk of a COVID-19-level pandemic 
is about 0.5% per year, and could be as high as 1.4% if new diseases emerge 
more frequently in the future. And we’ll come back to those numbers, but first, let’s look at another way
to estimate the likelihood of a future pandemic: modeling one from the ground up. For most pandemics to happen, a pathogen,
which is a microbe that can cause disease, has to spill over from its normal host by
making contact with and infecting a human. Then, the pathogen has to spread widely, crossing international boundaries
and infecting lots of people. Many variables determine whether a given
spillover event becomes a pandemic. For example, the type of pathogen, 
how often humans come into close contact with its animal reservoir, 
existing immunity, and so on. Viruses are prime candidates 
to cause the next big pandemic. Scientists estimate that there are about
1.7 million as-yet-undiscovered viruses that currently infect mammals and birds, and that roughly 40% of these have the
potential to spill over and infect humans. A team of scientists built a model

using this information, as well as data about the global
population, air travel networks, how people move around in communities,
country preparedness levels, and how people might respond to pandemics. The model generated hundreds of thousands
of virtual pandemics. The scientists then used 
this catalog to estimate that the probability of another 
COVID-19-level pandemic is 2.5 to 3.3% per year. To get a sense of how these risks
play out over a lifetime, let’s pick a value roughly in the middle
of all these estimates: 2%. Now let’s build what’s called 
a probability tree diagram to model all possible scenarios. The first branch of the tree
represents the first year: there’s a 2% probability of experiencing
a COVID-19-level pandemic, which means there’s a 98% probability 
of not experiencing one. Second branch, same thing, Third branch, same. And so on, 72 more times. There is only one path that results
in a fully pandemic-free lifetime: 98%, or 0.98,
multiplied by itself 75 times, which comes out to roughly 22%. So the likelihood of living through 
at least one more COVID 19-level-pandemic in the next 75 years 
is 100 minus 22%, or 78%. 78%! If we use the most optimistic
yearly estimate— 0.5%— the lifetime probability drops to 31%. If we use the most pessimistic one,
it jumps to 92%. Even 31% is too high to ignore; even if we get lucky, 
future generations might not. Also, pandemics are usually
random, independent events: so even if the yearly probability 
of a COVID-19-level pandemic is 1%, we could absolutely get another
one in ten years. The good news is we now have tools 
that make pandemics less destructive. Scientists estimated that early warning
systems, contact tracing, social distancing, 
and other public health measures saved over a million lives 
in just the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, not to mention the millions
of lives saved by vaccines. One day, another pandemic
will sweep the globe. But we can work to make that day
less likely to be tomorrow. We can reduce the risk
of spillover events, and we can contain spillovers
that do happen so they don’t become full-blown pandemics. Imagine how the future might
look if we interacted with the animal world more carefully, and if we had well-funded, open-access 
global disease monitoring programs, AI-powered contact tracing
and isolation measures, universal vaccines, 
next-generation antiviral drugs, and other tech we haven't even thought of. It’s in our power to change 
these probabilities. So, we have a choice: we could do nothing
and hope we get lucky. Or we could take the threat 
seriously enough that it becomes a self-defeating prophecy. Which future would you rather live in?

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Smallpox is one of the deadliest
diseases in history, but fortunately, it’s been eradicated
for over 40 years. However, samples of the virus 
that causes smallpox still exist, leading to concern that rogue actors
might try to weaponize it. This is especially worrying because older smallpox vaccines
can have serious side effects, and modern antiviral drugs have never
been tested against this disease. To protect against this potential threat, the US government is funding research
to improve smallpox treatments and vaccines. And since it’s unethical to expose 
people to a highly lethal virus, labs are using humanity's closest
biological relatives as research subjects. But is it right to harm these animals to
protect humanity from a potential threat? Or should our closest relatives also be
protected against lethal experiments? What would you do as a scientist faced
with this very real scenario? In many ways, this dilemma isn't new. Animals have been used in research aimed
at improving human welfare for centuries, typically at the cost of their lives. This practice reflects the widespread
belief that human lives are more valuable than non-human lives. People have different views about 
the ethics of animal testing and how it’s conducted. But whatever your opinion, this scenario raises an important
philosophical question: how do we determine the value of a life,
whether human or non-human? One tool philosophers have used 
to consider this question is moral status. Beings with moral status
should have their needs and interests taken into consideration by those 
making decisions that impact them. Traditionally, moral status
has been seen as binary— either a being’s interests matter 
for their own sake, or they don’t. And historically, many philosophers
believed that humans had moral status and other animals didn’t. Some contemporary philosophers
like Shelly Kagan have argued that moral status
comes in degrees, but even in this model, he argues 
that people have the most moral status. However, determining what grants any
degree of moral status can be difficult. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant
thought humans have moral status because of their rational nature 
and ability to will their actions. A binary conception of moral status then
suggests that beings with these capacities are “persons” bearing full moral status, while all other creatures are “things”
without moral status. But thinkers like Christine Korsgaard 
have argued a Kantian view should include many non-human animals 
because of how they value their own good. Another line of argument, suggested 
by utilitarianism’s founding father Jeremy Bentham and elaborated
by Peter Singer, claims that a capacity for suffering makes an entity worthy 
of moral consideration. These inclusive ways of thinking about
moral status dramatically widen the scope of our moral responsibility, in ways some people might find unnerving. So where do our monkeys stand? Our closest genetic relatives have
high social and intellectual capacities. They live cooperatively 
in complex social groups and recognize members 
of their community as individuals. They support and learn from one another— there’s even evidence 
they respond to inequality. And of course,
they’re capable of suffering. Yet despite all this, 
it’s still generally common opinion that a human’s life is more valuable
than a monkey’s. And that while killing one human 
to save five others is typically wrong, killing one monkey to save five humans 
is regrettable, but morally acceptable. Even morally required. At some point, however, 
this calculation starts to feel unstable. Should we kill 100 monkeys 
to save five people? How about 10,000? If moral status is binary and monkeys
don't have it, then theoretically, any number of monkeys could be sacrificed
to save just one person. But if moral status comes in degrees
and monkeys have any at all, then at some point the balance will tip. The situation you're in complicates
things even further. Unlike the scenarios above, there's no guarantee your work
will ever save human lives. This is true of any animal experiment— the process of scientific discovery only
sometimes leads to improved medical care. But in your case,
it’s even trickier! While the government is worried smallpox
might be weaponized, if they’re wrong
the disease will remain eradicated, and your research won’t save
anyone from smallpox. You could try to quantify this uncertainty
to help make your decision. But how do you determine what 
an acceptable amount of risk is? And what if there’s so much uncertainty
that your calculations are essentially wild guesses? These kinds of moral mathematics
get complicated fast, and some philosophers would
argue they’re not even the best way to make moral decisions. But whatever you decide, 
your choice should be well justified.

**Transcript**:
Smallpox is one of the deadliest
diseases in history, but fortunately, it’s been eradicated
for over 40 years. However, samples of the virus 
that causes smallpox still exist, leading to concern that rogue actors
might try to weaponize it. This is especially worrying because older smallpox vaccines
can have serious side effects, and modern antiviral drugs have never
been tested against this disease. To protect against this potential threat, the US government is funding research
to improve smallpox treatments and vaccines. And since it’s unethical to expose 
people to a highly lethal virus, labs are using humanity's closest
biological relatives as research subjects. But is it right to harm these animals to
protect humanity from a potential threat? Or should our closest relatives also be
protected against lethal experiments? What would you do as a scientist faced
with this very real scenario? In many ways, this dilemma isn't new. Animals have been used in research aimed
at improving human welfare for centuries, typically at the cost of their lives. This practice reflects the widespread
belief that human lives are more valuable than non-human lives. People have different views about 
the ethics of animal testing and how it’s conducted. But whatever your opinion, this scenario raises an important
philosophical question: how do we determine the value of a life,
whether human or non-human? One tool philosophers have used 
to consider this question is moral status. Beings with moral status
should have their needs and interests taken into consideration by those 
making decisions that impact them. Traditionally, moral status
has been seen as binary— either a being’s interests matter 
for their own sake, or they don’t. And historically, many philosophers
believed that humans had moral status and other animals didn’t. Some contemporary philosophers
like Shelly Kagan have argued that moral status
comes in degrees, but even in this model, he argues 
that people have the most moral status. However, determining what grants any
degree of moral status can be difficult. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant
thought humans have moral status because of their rational nature 
and ability to will their actions. A binary conception of moral status then
suggests that beings with these capacities are “persons” bearing full moral status, while all other creatures are “things”
without moral status. But thinkers like Christine Korsgaard 
have argued a Kantian view should include many non-human animals 
because of how they value their own good. Another line of argument, suggested 
by utilitarianism’s founding father Jeremy Bentham and elaborated
by Peter Singer, claims that a capacity for suffering makes an entity worthy 
of moral consideration. These inclusive ways of thinking about
moral status dramatically widen the scope of our moral responsibility, in ways some people might find unnerving. So where do our monkeys stand? Our closest genetic relatives have
high social and intellectual capacities. They live cooperatively 
in complex social groups and recognize members 
of their community as individuals. They support and learn from one another— there’s even evidence 
they respond to inequality. And of course,
they’re capable of suffering. Yet despite all this, 
it’s still generally common opinion that a human’s life is more valuable
than a monkey’s. And that while killing one human 
to save five others is typically wrong, killing one monkey to save five humans 
is regrettable, but morally acceptable. Even morally required. At some point, however, 
this calculation starts to feel unstable. Should we kill 100 monkeys 
to save five people? How about 10,000? If moral status is binary and monkeys
don't have it, then theoretically, any number of monkeys could be sacrificed
to save just one person. But if moral status comes in degrees
and monkeys have any at all, then at some point the balance will tip. The situation you're in complicates
things even further. Unlike the scenarios above, there's no guarantee your work
will ever save human lives. This is true of any animal experiment— the process of scientific discovery only
sometimes leads to improved medical care. But in your case,
it’s even trickier! While the government is worried smallpox
might be weaponized, if they’re wrong
the disease will remain eradicated, and your research won’t save
anyone from smallpox. You could try to quantify this uncertainty
to help make your decision. But how do you determine what 
an acceptable amount of risk is? And what if there’s so much uncertainty
that your calculations are essentially wild guesses? These kinds of moral mathematics
get complicated fast, and some philosophers would
argue they’re not even the best way to make moral decisions. But whatever you decide, 
your choice should be well justified.

**Transcript**:
- A blood moon lunar eclipse
wasn't always something to look forward to. When the moon turned red thousands of years ago, the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians feared
that something monstrous and evil was eating the moon. They would shout at the night sky to try and fend off the ravenous beasts and since the average lunar eclipse lasts around 100 minutes, and the moon returns to normal afterward, they
were probably convinced that their whooping and
howling actually worked. We know now that the moon
doesn't need our protection, but why does it turn
red in the first place? (peaceful music) Whenever you look up at a full moon, you're seeing sunlight that's reflected off the lunar surface, so if something were
to block that sunlight say, the earth, then in theory, the moon should disappear from view but during a total lunar eclipse when the moon passes
through the earth's shadow, we get a red moon, not a vanishing one. So what's going on? To figure it out, let's take a quick trip to the lunar surface. This is a NASA simulation
of what the earth looks like during a total lunar eclipse. Notice the red ring around our planet. Everywhere you see that
ring is either a sunrise or a sunset, and while
it's true that no direct sunlight is reaching the lunar surface at this moment, earth's
atmosphere is bending the red wavelengths of
light around the planet, so that redness you see
during a blood moon eclipse is a combination of
light from every sunrise and sunset on earth,
all happening at once. So the moon appears
red for the same reason that sunrises and sunsets on earth are red because of a phenomenon
called Rayleigh Scattering. Named after the British
physicist, John William Strutt, also known as Lord
Rayleigh, who discovered it in the late 19th century. It describes how different
colors of sunlight interact with the earth's atmosphere. Look at the sky during
daytime, for example. It appears blue because air molecules in earth's atmosphere scatter
blue light more easily than red, but during sunrise and sunset, the light travels through
more of earth's atmosphere before reaching your eye
which has two consequences. First, it means more overall
sunlight is scattered, making the sun appear dimmer. That's why you can easily
gaze upon the sun at sunset compared to at high noon. And secondly, more scattering
means more blue light is scattered away, leaving the
redder wavelengths behind. Similarly, the ring around earth during a total lunar eclipse is red because the sunlight travels
through a long stretch of earth's atmosphere, from one end of the planet to the other. So rather than fear a blood
moon like the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians, why not think
of it as a romantic moment? After all, it's the only time
when you can see the sunrise and sunset simultaneously. (peaceful music)

**Transcript**:
- A blood moon lunar eclipse
wasn't always something to look forward to. When the moon turned red thousands of years ago, the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians feared
that something monstrous and evil was eating the moon. They would shout at the night sky to try and fend off the ravenous beasts and since the average lunar eclipse lasts around 100 minutes, and the moon returns to normal afterward, they
were probably convinced that their whooping and
howling actually worked. We know now that the moon
doesn't need our protection, but why does it turn
red in the first place? (peaceful music) Whenever you look up at a full moon, you're seeing sunlight that's reflected off the lunar surface, so if something were
to block that sunlight say, the earth, then in theory, the moon should disappear from view but during a total lunar eclipse when the moon passes
through the earth's shadow, we get a red moon, not a vanishing one. So what's going on? To figure it out, let's take a quick trip to the lunar surface. This is a NASA simulation
of what the earth looks like during a total lunar eclipse. Notice the red ring around our planet. Everywhere you see that
ring is either a sunrise or a sunset, and while
it's true that no direct sunlight is reaching the lunar surface at this moment, earth's
atmosphere is bending the red wavelengths of
light around the planet, so that redness you see
during a blood moon eclipse is a combination of
light from every sunrise and sunset on earth,
all happening at once. So the moon appears
red for the same reason that sunrises and sunsets on earth are red because of a phenomenon
called Rayleigh Scattering. Named after the British
physicist, John William Strutt, also known as Lord
Rayleigh, who discovered it in the late 19th century. It describes how different
colors of sunlight interact with the earth's atmosphere. Look at the sky during
daytime, for example. It appears blue because air molecules in earth's atmosphere scatter
blue light more easily than red, but during sunrise and sunset, the light travels through
more of earth's atmosphere before reaching your eye
which has two consequences. First, it means more overall
sunlight is scattered, making the sun appear dimmer. That's why you can easily
gaze upon the sun at sunset compared to at high noon. And secondly, more scattering
means more blue light is scattered away, leaving the
redder wavelengths behind. Similarly, the ring around earth during a total lunar eclipse is red because the sunlight travels
through a long stretch of earth's atmosphere, from one end of the planet to the other. So rather than fear a blood
moon like the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians, why not think
of it as a romantic moment? After all, it's the only time
when you can see the sunrise and sunset simultaneously. (peaceful music)

**Transcript**:
This round structure is only about 
ten billionths of a meter in diameter, but it— as well as other technologies
in the pipeline— could be stepping stones to a monumental
public health ambition: a single vaccine that protects you 
against everything. We’ll get back to the grand vision later,
but first, let’s start with something that’s
being developed now: a vaccine that would protect you 
against every strain of the flu— even ones that don’t exist yet. Here’s one flu virus particle. On the inside is the virus’ RNA, and on the outside are lots and lots
of hemagglutinin proteins. Hemagglutinin attaches to a receptor
on a human cell and fuses the viral and human membranes, 
starting the infection. Hemagglutinin is also one of the things
your immune system recognizes and reacts to the most. To understand how this works, think of hemagglutinin as a bust of 19th
century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Croissant! If you show Napoleon to an immune system
and say, “remember him,” the immune system will mostly
focus on his head. And the same is true 
for the real hemagglutinin. One way the immune system 
remembers things is by physically interacting with them. Think of it as making plaster molds
of parts of the head: we call these molds antibodies. The antibodies float around your
bloodstream for a while and then can diminish, but blueprints on how to make them 
are stored in specialized memory cells, waiting for future Napoleons to invade. Here’s the thing, though. Hemagglutinin is constantly mutating. Most mutations are subtle, produced by single letter changes 
in the virus’ RNA: like this or this. Over time, Napoleon-slash-hemagglutinin’s
head can change enough that our antibodies become less good
at recognizing it. This is called antigenic drift. Influenza is constantly drifting; that’s one reason you have to get
a new flu shot every year. But sometimes bigger changes happen. An animal, usually a pig, can
get infected with, say, a human flu and a bird flu. And those different viruses might
infect the same cell. If that happens, the two different viral
genomes can recombine in tens or even hundreds of ways. The human flu virus could 
pick up a bird flu hemagglutinin that’s never infected humans before. This is called antigenic shift, and if you get infected 
by this version of influenza, none of the antibodies against Napoleon's
head are going to help you. Antigenically shifted viruses
have the potential to infect many people very quickly, causing epidemics and sometimes pandemics. A truly universal flu vaccine would be
able to protect against current flu strains 
and future drifted or shifted strains. But how do we design a vaccine 
against a strain that doesn’t exist yet? We look to the past. There are key parts of hemagglutinin
that haven’t changed much over time and are probably critical
to infect human cells; these “conserved regions” could be 
promising targets for universal vaccines. But there's a problem that's hindered
classical vaccine production. Many conserved regions are in the neck, and it’s tough to get the immune system
to react to the neck. Also, because influenza-like viruses have
been around for hundreds of millions of years, there may not be a single region 
that’s common across all species and subtypes of influenza. But there’s promising science
in development. Remember this? This is a protein called ferritin; Its normal purpose is 
to store and move iron. But it’s also the rough size and shape
of a small virus. And if you attach viral proteins to it,
like this, you’d have something that looks,
to an immune system, like a virus— but would be completely harmless
and very engineerable. Recently, scientists engineered 
a ferritin nanoparticle to present 8 identical copies 
of the neck region of an H1 flu virus. They vaccinated mice 
with the nanoparticle, then injected them with a lethal dose 
of a completely different subtype, H5N1. All the vaccinated mice lived; 
all the unvaccinated ones died. Going one step beyond that, there may be conserved regions 
that we could take advantage of across different-but-related 
virus species— like SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and a few coronaviruses 
which cause some common colds. Over the past few decades, a different part of the immune system
has come into clearer focus. Instead of antibodies, 
this part of the immune system uses a vast array of T cells that kill,
for example, cells that have been infected by a virus. Vaccines that train this part
of the immune system, in addition to the antibody response,
could provide broader protection. A universal flu vaccine would be a
monumental achievement in public health. A fully universal vaccine against all
infectious disease is— for the moment— squarely in the realm of science fiction, partially because we have no idea 
how our immune system would react if we tried to train it against hundreds 
of different diseases at the same time. Probably not well. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Look at where medicine is today compared
to where it was two centuries ago. Who knows what it’ll look like
in another 50 or 100 years— maybe some future groundbreaking
technology will bring truly universal vaccines
within our grasp.

This round structure is only about 
ten billionths of a meter in diameter, but it— as well as other technologies
in the pipeline— could be stepping stones to a monumental
public health ambition: a single vaccine that protects you 
against everything. We’ll get back to the grand vision later,
but first, let’s start with something that’s
being developed now: a vaccine that would protect you 
against every strain of the flu— even ones that don’t exist yet. Here’s one flu virus particle. On the inside is the virus’ RNA, and on the outside are lots and lots
of hemagglutinin proteins. Hemagglutinin attaches to a receptor
on a human cell and fuses the viral and human membranes, 
starting the infection. Hemagglutinin is also one of the things
your immune system recognizes and reacts to the most. To understand how this works, think of hemagglutinin as a bust of 19th
century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Croissant! If you show Napoleon to an immune system
and say, “remember him,” the immune system will mostly
focus on his head. And the same is true 
for the real hemagglutinin. One way the immune system 
remembers things is by physically interacting with them. Think of it as making plaster molds
of parts of the head: we call these molds antibodies. The antibodies float around your
bloodstream for a while and then can diminish, but blueprints on how to make them 
are stored in specialized memory cells, waiting for future Napoleons to invade. Here’s the thing, though. Hemagglutinin is constantly mutating. Most mutations are subtle, produced by single letter changes 
in the virus’ RNA: like this or this. Over time, Napoleon-slash-hemagglutinin’s
head can change enough that our antibodies become less good
at recognizing it. This is called antigenic drift. Influenza is constantly drifting; that’s one reason you have to get
a new flu shot every year. But sometimes bigger changes happen. An animal, usually a pig, can
get infected with, say, a human flu and a bird flu. And those different viruses might
infect the same cell. If that happens, the two different viral
genomes can recombine in tens or even hundreds of ways. The human flu virus could 
pick up a bird flu hemagglutinin that’s never infected humans before. This is called antigenic shift, and if you get infected 
by this version of influenza, none of the antibodies against Napoleon's
head are going to help you. Antigenically shifted viruses
have the potential to infect many people very quickly, causing epidemics and sometimes pandemics. A truly universal flu vaccine would be
able to protect against current flu strains 
and future drifted or shifted strains. But how do we design a vaccine 
against a strain that doesn’t exist yet? We look to the past. There are key parts of hemagglutinin
that haven’t changed much over time and are probably critical
to infect human cells; these “conserved regions” could be 
promising targets for universal vaccines. But there's a problem that's hindered
classical vaccine production. Many conserved regions are in the neck, and it’s tough to get the immune system
to react to the neck. Also, because influenza-like viruses have
been around for hundreds of millions of years, there may not be a single region 
that’s common across all species and subtypes of influenza. But there’s promising science
in development. Remember this? This is a protein called ferritin; Its normal purpose is 
to store and move iron. But it’s also the rough size and shape
of a small virus. And if you attach viral proteins to it,
like this, you’d have something that looks,
to an immune system, like a virus— but would be completely harmless
and very engineerable. Recently, scientists engineered 
a ferritin nanoparticle to present 8 identical copies 
of the neck region of an H1 flu virus. They vaccinated mice 
with the nanoparticle, then injected them with a lethal dose 
of a completely different subtype, H5N1. All the vaccinated mice lived; 
all the unvaccinated ones died. Going one step beyond that, there may be conserved regions 
that we could take advantage of across different-but-related 
virus species— like SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and a few coronaviruses 
which cause some common colds. Over the past few decades, a different part of the immune system
has come into clearer focus. Instead of antibodies, 
this part of the immune system uses a vast array of T cells that kill,
for example, cells that have been infected by a virus. Vaccines that train this part
of the immune system, in addition to the antibody response,
could provide broader protection. A universal flu vaccine would be a
monumental achievement in public health. A fully universal vaccine against all
infectious disease is— for the moment— squarely in the realm of science fiction, partially because we have no idea 
how our immune system would react if we tried to train it against hundreds 
of different diseases at the same time. Probably not well. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Look at where medicine is today compared
to where it was two centuries ago. Who knows what it’ll look like
in another 50 or 100 years— maybe some future groundbreaking
technology will bring truly universal vaccines
within our grasp.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to physics and the multiverse, while the ground truth MCQ is related to a universal flu vaccine.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the question format and style, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if we look at the question format of the generated MCQs, question 11 has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ, with 4 options and a question that asks about a specific concept. However, the content and intent of question 11 are not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 10, Question 1
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Each one of these machines represents
the economic system of a country. Every machine has three inputs: labor, people’s work. Capital, all the stuff 
that a business might use, including intangibles, like ideas. And natural resources. The machine converts these inputs
into goods and services, and because we’re willing to pay 
for the things the machine produces, what the machine is really creating here
is value. Economies turn inputs into value. What determines whether the machine
is capitalist, communist, socialist, or something else? Three dials. The first dial controls 
who owns the capital. Over here, the government owns 
every bit of capital, down to the last office paperclip. North Korea is probably 
the closest economy to 0%. On the other end of the spectrum, at 100%,
private citizens own all the capital. The US is about here, 
at roughly two-thirds private ownership. The second dial dictates how much control 
the government has over what gets produced. In economies with high coordination, 
like the old USSR, the government dictated what the economy
could— and would— produce. In economies with low coordination, the government might mandate a few things, but leaves most decision-making
up to the private sector. The third dial controls how extensively
markets are used to set prices. Over here at 0%, we have economies
with no markets, where the government sets all prices,
and consumers have no say. Over here at 100%, markets are used to set 
the price of everything, even things like basic 
life-saving health care. You can also think of this dial
as controlling the number and extent of government regulations— from tariffs on foreign goods 
to antitrust laws to regulations on net neutrality. So, capitalism isn’t just
one type of economy— it’s a wide range of possible economies, which makes answering the question of
whether capitalism is broken, complicated. But we’re going to try. At the height 
of the Industrial Revolution, the dials were set pretty close 
to what we now call free market, or “laissez-faire” capitalism. There were very few regulations, and economists of the time believed
that capitalism’s “invisible hand”— basically, individuals acting freely
and in their own self-interest— would produce optimal outcomes,
both for the economy and for society. And that’s how we ended 
up with embalming fluid in milk. In the late 1800s in the United States, 
food manufacturers put all kinds of cheap (and sometimes dangerous) adulterants
in food to maximize profits. What they were doing was legal,
but of course, wrong. There was a public outcry, 
and in 1906, Congress passed 
the Pure Food and Drugs Act, setting the stage 
for the Food and Drug Administration, which watches over the US’s
food supply to this day. These days, no economy really practices
pure “invisible hand” capitalism, but some people are increasingly worried
that today’s threats, like climate change and rising inequality,
can’t be solved by any capitalist system. Let’s look at climate change first. Capitalist economies incentivize growth. That’s created massive demand 
for the cheapest energy possible, which, for a long time, was fossil fuels. Burning all those fossil fuels
unquestionably drove— and continues to drive— climate change. Not only that, but the desire to maximize
profit usually gives corporations a powerful incentive to ignore
inconvenient truths. Just like tobacco companies denied 
the link between cigarettes and cancer, oil and gas companies denied 
or downplayed climate science for decades. Next, inequality. Inequality is complicated enough that
we made a whole video about it, but the simple story is: in many countries, inequality is rising. In the US, the UK, Canada, Ireland, 
and Australia, the top 1% of income earners have been
eating up a larger and larger share of total income over the past 50 years. In the UK, the top 1% share doubled
from 7% in 1980 to 14% in 2014. But that's not the whole picture. In England, the country for which we have
the best data before capitalism, the share of income going
to the top 5% of income earners peaked at around 40% in 1801, and then, as capitalism took hold, it fell
steadily to a low of about 17% in 1977. These days, it’s back up— 
hovering around 26%. And here’s another data point: 
in many European countries and Japan, the top 1%’s share of income came
down from 20 to 25% in the early 1900s to 7 to 12% today. So, is capitalism increasing inequality
or not? It depends. Remember, there's a wide range of settings
that all fall under capitalism, meaning that one country's version can
look very different from another's. It’s totally possible that inequality
could be increasing in China’s version of capitalism, 
while it decreases in France’s. Capitalism, it seems, 
is a double-edged sword. On the one hand,
it generates a huge amount of value, which translates to almost everyone having
more money than they otherwise would. On the other hand, it also funnels
the biggest chunk of that money into the wallets of relatively few people. Capitalism’s staunchest defenders say 
that with enough grit and determination, anyone can join the ranks of the wealthy. Is that really true? In a free, capitalist market, the wealth generated by successful
companies mostly flows to the owners. And along with that come 
other benefits: education, health, social standing,
and power. If owners tinker with the machine so that
it benefits them more than others, they create a feedback loop where power
and everything that flows with it calcifies within their families. And then you’ve got, basically, 
an aristocracy. So let’s break down the question
we started with: is pure, “invisible hand” capitalism, with all the dials set to the extremes,
broken? Yeah. But it’s also kind of irrelevant,
since no country uses pure capitalism. Is contemporary capitalism— as it’s practiced in much 
of the world today— broken? Well, it’s the major driver
of climate change and in many places is contributing
to rising inequality. And it may even be creating a de facto
aristocracy in certain countries, so, not looking good. The critical question is: 
can we fix contemporary capitalism by fiddling with the dials
or restricting who can turn them, or do we need to tear the machine down
and build a new one from scratch?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about economic inputs, whereas the generated MCQs are primarily focused on energy, power grids, and carbon emissions.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 5: "What is the main challenge facing power grids in making full use of intermittent energy sources like wind and solar power?" This question is not directly related to economic inputs, but it does mention a challenge related to resources, which could be tangentially related to natural resources, one of the options in the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Index: 5 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that Question 2 is the closest match, although it's not a perfect match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the "dials" that regulate different forms of capitalism, and the correct answer is "All of the above" (private ownership of capital, central coordination, and use of markets to set prices).

Question 2 asks about the characteristic of the dispatch curve used by power grid operators, which is not related to the topic of capitalism. However, it's the only question that has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ, with options that describe different characteristics.

If I had to choose, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

2

However, I want to emphasize that this is not a perfect match, and the generated MCQs do not accurately reflect the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

hovering around 26%. And here’s another data point: 
in many European countries and Japan, the top 1%’s share of income came
down from 20 to 25% in the early 1900s to 7 to 12% today. So, is capitalism increasing inequality
or not? It depends. Remember, there's a wide range of settings
that all fall under capitalism, meaning that one country's version can
look very different from another's. It’s totally possible that inequality
could be increasing in China’s version of capitalism, 
while it decreases in France’s. Capitalism, it seems, 
is a double-edged sword. On the one hand,
it generates a huge amount of value, which translates to almost everyone having
more money than they otherwise would. On the other hand, it also funnels
the biggest chunk of that money into the wallets of relatively few people. Capitalism’s staunchest defenders say 
that with enough grit and determination, anyone can join the ranks of the wealthy. Is that really true? In a free, capitalist market, the wealth generated by successful
companies mostly flows to the owners. And along with that come 
other benefits: education, health, social standing,
and power. If owners tinker with the machine so that
it benefits them more than others, they create a feedback loop where power
and everything that flows with it calcifies within their families. And then you’ve got, basically, 
an aristocracy. So let’s break down the question
we started with: is pure, “invisible hand” capitalism, with all the dials set to the extremes,
broken? Yeah. But it’s also kind of irrelevant,
since no country uses pure capitalism. Is contemporary capitalism— as it’s practiced in much 
of the world today— broken? Well, it’s the major driver
of climate change and in many places is contributing
to rising inequality. And it may even be creating a de facto
aristocracy in certain countries, so, not looking good. The critical question is: 
can we fix contemporary capitalism by fiddling with the dials
or restricting who can turn them, or do we need to tear the machine down
and build a new one from scratch?

**Transcript**:
Each one of these machines represents
the economic system of a country. Every machine has three inputs: labor, people’s work. Capital, all the stuff 
that a business might use, including intangibles, like ideas. And natural resources. The machine converts these inputs
into goods and services, and because we’re willing to pay 
for the things the machine produces, what the machine is really creating here
is value. Economies turn inputs into value. What determines whether the machine
is capitalist, communist, socialist, or something else? Three dials. The first dial controls 
who owns the capital. Over here, the government owns 
every bit of capital, down to the last office paperclip. North Korea is probably 
the closest economy to 0%. On the other end of the spectrum, at 100%,
private citizens own all the capital. The US is about here, 
at roughly two-thirds private ownership. The second dial dictates how much control 
the government has over what gets produced. In economies with high coordination, 
like the old USSR, the government dictated what the economy
could— and would— produce. In economies with low coordination, the government might mandate a few things, but leaves most decision-making
up to the private sector. The third dial controls how extensively
markets are used to set prices. Over here at 0%, we have economies
with no markets, where the government sets all prices,
and consumers have no say. Over here at 100%, markets are used to set 
the price of everything, even things like basic 
life-saving health care. You can also think of this dial
as controlling the number and extent of government regulations— from tariffs on foreign goods 
to antitrust laws to regulations on net neutrality. So, capitalism isn’t just
one type of economy— it’s a wide range of possible economies, which makes answering the question of
whether capitalism is broken, complicated. But we’re going to try. At the height 
of the Industrial Revolution, the dials were set pretty close 
to what we now call free market, or “laissez-faire” capitalism. There were very few regulations, and economists of the time believed
that capitalism’s “invisible hand”— basically, individuals acting freely
and in their own self-interest— would produce optimal outcomes,
both for the economy and for society. And that’s how we ended 
up with embalming fluid in milk. In the late 1800s in the United States, 
food manufacturers put all kinds of cheap (and sometimes dangerous) adulterants
in food to maximize profits. What they were doing was legal,
but of course, wrong. There was a public outcry, 
and in 1906, Congress passed 
the Pure Food and Drugs Act, setting the stage 
for the Food and Drug Administration, which watches over the US’s
food supply to this day. These days, no economy really practices
pure “invisible hand” capitalism, but some people are increasingly worried
that today’s threats, like climate change and rising inequality,
can’t be solved by any capitalist system. Let’s look at climate change first. Capitalist economies incentivize growth. That’s created massive demand 
for the cheapest energy possible, which, for a long time, was fossil fuels. Burning all those fossil fuels
unquestionably drove— and continues to drive— climate change. Not only that, but the desire to maximize
profit usually gives corporations a powerful incentive to ignore
inconvenient truths. Just like tobacco companies denied 
the link between cigarettes and cancer, oil and gas companies denied 
or downplayed climate science for decades. Next, inequality. Inequality is complicated enough that
we made a whole video about it, but the simple story is: in many countries, inequality is rising. In the US, the UK, Canada, Ireland, 
and Australia, the top 1% of income earners have been
eating up a larger and larger share of total income over the past 50 years. In the UK, the top 1% share doubled
from 7% in 1980 to 14% in 2014. But that's not the whole picture. In England, the country for which we have
the best data before capitalism, the share of income going
to the top 5% of income earners peaked at around 40% in 1801, and then, as capitalism took hold, it fell
steadily to a low of about 17% in 1977. These days, it’s back up— 
hovering around 26%. And here’s another data point:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the change in the total share of wealth of the top 1% in the UK between 1980 and 2014, while the generated MCQs are about power grids, renewable energy, and carbon emissions.

Since there is no matching generated MCQ, I will return "None" as the answer.

However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar MCQ, I would say that Question 8 is the closest, but only because it mentions a specific percentage change (although it's about carbon emissions, not wealth share). But this is a very weak match, and I would not recommend using it as a substitute for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Mumbling fantastical gibberish;
devouring blocks of cheese in the nude; peeing in places that aren’t toilets;
and jumping out of windows. These are all things people have
reportedly done while sleepwalking, a behavior that’s mostly benign 
but can be dangerous in rare cases. It's estimated that around 18% of people
sleepwalk at least once in their lives. So, what exactly is sleepwalking? First, we have to understand just how
many of our daily activities do not require our active attention. Your prefrontal cortex is
your brain's conscious, deliberate, decision-making control hub. You might decide to get up and walk
using your prefrontal cortex, but the intricate coordination
of sensory inputs and muscles that follows does 
not require any attention. Instead, it’s mostly executed 
by a network of specialized nerve cells along the lower part of the brain 
and spinal cord, sometimes called
“central pattern generators.” These areas govern automatic movements
and basic actions related to survival. People with a REM sleep behavior disorder
may enact their dreams while they’re in REM sleep, usually keeping their eyes closed. However, this is a separate condition. Sleepwalking arises from a very different
stage of sleep— the deepest stage of non-REM sleep,
which is called “slow-wave sleep.” In this state, the cortex, 
including the prefrontal cortex, is essentially turned off. When someone is roused from this stage, they’ll usually appear groggy 
before either dozing off again or becoming fully conscious. For that moment, though, 
they’re in an intermediate state straddling sleep and wakefulness. A sleepwalking episode is, essentially,
an extreme, prolonged version of this. When sleepwalking, 
the prefrontal cortex remains inactive, so the person doesn’t possess executive,
deliberate control over their actions. But other parts of their brain are active. And, as we know, 
the body is capable of a lot without involving the prefrontal cortex. Sleepwalkers
avoid obstacles, walk, and speak— though it's often nonsense. Most sleepwalkers can do basic things, operating in a peaceful, unemotional, 
dreamless state. In rare cases, sleepwalkers perform more 
complex tasks like cooking and driving. They're occasionally guided
by physical urges, like eating or pursuing sexual activities. And some episodes involve the brain’s
fight or flight system, during which the person might suddenly 
perceive an imminent danger, and vocalize, cry, or even jolt out of bed
and run away. These episodes, 
called “sleep terrors,” are more common in young children
and usually result naturally. Indeed, sleepwalking is generally
more common in children, perhaps because the brain areas 
that control the transition between sleep and wakefulness
are still developing. But the exact mechanisms that cause
sleepwalking remain unclear. Many cases appear to run in families,
while others are more mysterious. Anything that could lead 
to partial awakening is thought to increase the likelihood. This includes factors that promote
deeper slow-wave sleep— like sedatives, hot sleep environments,
and operating on too little sleep— or things that disrupt sleep— 
like stress and other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea 
and restless leg syndrome. Doctors will usually evaluate 
these factors and promote habits that aid in healthy sleep, 
such as exercise, stress management, and a consistent and sufficient 
sleep schedule. They’ll also often recommend 
safety measures, like hiding dangerous items, installing 
door alarms and securing windows. If this doesn't help, they'll consider
certain medications. But many of the available treatments
for sleepwalking haven’t yet been rigorously studied, so how they work and how effective
they are is not entirely clear. So, what should you do 
if you encounter a sleepwalker? A common misconception is that rousing
a sleepwalker causes irreparable harm. Fortunately, this is not true. However, trying to forcefully wake them

**Transcript**:
Mumbling fantastical gibberish;
devouring blocks of cheese in the nude; peeing in places that aren’t toilets;
and jumping out of windows. These are all things people have
reportedly done while sleepwalking, a behavior that’s mostly benign 
but can be dangerous in rare cases. It's estimated that around 18% of people
sleepwalk at least once in their lives. So, what exactly is sleepwalking? First, we have to understand just how
many of our daily activities do not require our active attention. Your prefrontal cortex is
your brain's conscious, deliberate, decision-making control hub. You might decide to get up and walk
using your prefrontal cortex, but the intricate coordination
of sensory inputs and muscles that follows does 
not require any attention. Instead, it’s mostly executed 
by a network of specialized nerve cells along the lower part of the brain 
and spinal cord, sometimes called
“central pattern generators.” These areas govern automatic movements
and basic actions related to survival. People with a REM sleep behavior disorder
may enact their dreams while they’re in REM sleep, usually keeping their eyes closed. However, this is a separate condition. Sleepwalking arises from a very different
stage of sleep— the deepest stage of non-REM sleep,
which is called “slow-wave sleep.” In this state, the cortex, 
including the prefrontal cortex, is essentially turned off. When someone is roused from this stage, they’ll usually appear groggy 
before either dozing off again or becoming fully conscious. For that moment, though, 
they’re in an intermediate state straddling sleep and wakefulness. A sleepwalking episode is, essentially,
an extreme, prolonged version of this. When sleepwalking, 
the prefrontal cortex remains inactive, so the person doesn’t possess executive,
deliberate control over their actions. But other parts of their brain are active. And, as we know, 
the body is capable of a lot without involving the prefrontal cortex. Sleepwalkers
avoid obstacles, walk, and speak— though it's often nonsense. Most sleepwalkers can do basic things, operating in a peaceful, unemotional, 
dreamless state. In rare cases, sleepwalkers perform more 
complex tasks like cooking and driving. They're occasionally guided
by physical urges, like eating or pursuing sexual activities. And some episodes involve the brain’s
fight or flight system, during which the person might suddenly 
perceive an imminent danger, and vocalize, cry, or even jolt out of bed
and run away. These episodes, 
called “sleep terrors,” are more common in young children
and usually result naturally. Indeed, sleepwalking is generally
more common in children, perhaps because the brain areas 
that control the transition between sleep and wakefulness
are still developing. But the exact mechanisms that cause
sleepwalking remain unclear. Many cases appear to run in families,

a sleepwalker causes irreparable harm. Fortunately, this is not true. However, trying to forcefully wake them
can cause confusion and distress. The best practice seems to be 
to gently guide them back to bed; and, if they resist, to simply ensure
they’re safe until the episode resolves.

**Transcript**:
In 2000, a company called ViroPharma
ran clinical trials of pleconaril, a new pill designed to treat 
the common cold. In many patients, the pill helped. But in 7 of them, 
just a few days into the treatment, researchers found mutated virus variants
that were almost completely resistant to pleconaril. Viruses are always mutating, but this one
mutated so quickly that it managed to outmaneuver years of research 
and development in just a few days. If you didn't have an immune
system and caught a cold, the infection would quickly spread
deep into your lungs. Rampant viral replication would destroy
tissue there, until your lungs couldn’t supply your body
with enough oxygen and you’d asphyxiate. Unfortunately, for millions of people
around the world who live with a less-than-fully-functional
immune system or who are on immunosuppressant drugs, this is a real risk: “minor” infections can turn serious
or even deadly. But if you're fortunate enough to have
a fully functional immune system, a cold will probably give you 
a few relatively mild symptoms. On average, adults catch more than
150 colds throughout their lives. And despite the fact 
that the symptoms are similar, the cause could be different each time. Common colds are caused by at least
8 different families of virus, each of which can have 
its own species and subtypes. How can so many different viruses
cause the same illness? Well, viruses can only invade
our bodies in a few ways: one is to come in on a breath. We have to breathe, so our immune system 
sets up a bunch of frontline defenses and these are actually what produce
many of the symptoms of a cold. Your mucus-y, dripping nose is your immune
system trapping and flushing out virus. Your fever is your immune system 
raising your body temperature to slow down viral replication. And your inflamed, well, everything, that’s your immune system
widening your blood vessels and recruiting its white blood cell army
to help kill the virus. So, if the common cold is caused
by many different viruses, is a cure even possible? Here’s one fact in our favor: a single family of viruses causes 
30 to 50% of all colds: rhinovirus. If we could eliminate all
rhinovirus infections, we’d be a long way towards curing
the common cold. There are two main ways to fight a virus:
vaccines and antiviral drugs. The first attempt to create a rhinovirus
vaccine was a success— but a short-lived one. In 1957, William Price vaccinated 50 kids 
with inactivated rhinovirus and gave 50 others a placebo. Soon afterwards, a rhinovirus outbreak 
spread throughout the kids. In the vaccinated group, only 3 got sick. In the placebo group, 23 did— 
almost 8 times as many. And despite the small numbers, 
this was promising: the immune systems of vaccinated kids 
were successfully recognizing and responding to rhinovirus. But later trials of the vaccine showed
no protection at all— none. This wasn’t Price’s fault— no one at the time knew that rhinovirus
had multiple subtypes. Price’s vaccine, 
for reasons we don’t fully understand, didn't provide broad protection, meaning it was only effective against one
or maybe a few subtypes of rhinovirus— out of 169 subtypes and counting. Sometimes, when we make a vaccine, 
we get lucky. The mRNA COVID vaccines, for example, effectively protect us against severe
disease and death across the original virus 
and variants too. But we have yet to create a broadly
protective vaccine against rhinovirus, or any other virus that causes
the common cold. Okay, what about antiviral drugs? Viruses hijack human cellular machinery
to replicate and spread, so it’s hard to make a molecule
that’s toxic to the virus without also being toxic to the human. And even if you manage to do that, the virus could mutate 
out of reach of the drug. Viruses are slippery beasts. We have, though, had some
incredible successes: we eradicated smallpox thanks
to an effective vaccine, the fact that it can’t hide
out in other species, and its relatively low mutation rate. HIV, on the other hand, mutates so quickly
that in an untreated individual, every possible single-letter mutation
in the virus’s genetic code could, in theory,
be produced in a single day. Despite trying for decades, 
we still don’t have a vaccine. But we do have an effective
cocktail of HIV drugs that the virus can’t easily mutate 
away from. Unfortunately, 
we are stuck with colds for now. But the last few decades have featured
some entirely game-changing medical breakthroughs,
like mRNA vaccines and CRISPR. CRISPR could be particularly promising
as an antiviral agent, because it originally evolved in bacteria
as an immune defense against viruses. In fact, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a research team showed that 
a CRISPR system could degrade coronavirus and influenza genomes
in our lung cells. They called their system prophylactic
antiviral CRISPR in human cells. Or, for short, PAC-MAN.

many of the symptoms of a cold. Your mucus-y, dripping nose is your immune
system trapping and flushing out virus. Your fever is your immune system 
raising your body temperature to slow down viral replication. And your inflamed, well, everything, that’s your immune system
widening your blood vessels and recruiting its white blood cell army
to help kill the virus. So, if the common cold is caused
by many different viruses, is a cure even possible? Here’s one fact in our favor: a single family of viruses causes 
30 to 50% of all colds: rhinovirus. If we could eliminate all
rhinovirus infections, we’d be a long way towards curing
the common cold. There are two main ways to fight a virus:
vaccines and antiviral drugs. The first attempt to create a rhinovirus
vaccine was a success— but a short-lived one. In 1957, William Price vaccinated 50 kids 
with inactivated rhinovirus and gave 50 others a placebo. Soon afterwards, a rhinovirus outbreak 
spread throughout the kids. In the vaccinated group, only 3 got sick. In the placebo group, 23 did— 
almost 8 times as many. And despite the small numbers, 
this was promising: the immune systems of vaccinated kids 
were successfully recognizing and responding to rhinovirus. But later trials of the vaccine showed
no protection at all— none. This wasn’t Price’s fault— no one at the time knew that rhinovirus
had multiple subtypes. Price’s vaccine, 
for reasons we don’t fully understand, didn't provide broad protection, meaning it was only effective against one
or maybe a few subtypes of rhinovirus— out of 169 subtypes and counting. Sometimes, when we make a vaccine, 
we get lucky. The mRNA COVID vaccines, for example, effectively protect us against severe
disease and death across the original virus 
and variants too. But we have yet to create a broadly
protective vaccine against rhinovirus, or any other virus that causes
the common cold. Okay, what about antiviral drugs? Viruses hijack human cellular machinery
to replicate and spread, so it’s hard to make a molecule
that’s toxic to the virus without also being toxic to the human. And even if you manage to do that, the virus could mutate 
out of reach of the drug. Viruses are slippery beasts. We have, though, had some
incredible successes: we eradicated smallpox thanks
to an effective vaccine, the fact that it can’t hide
out in other species, and its relatively low mutation rate. HIV, on the other hand, mutates so quickly
that in an untreated individual, every possible single-letter mutation
in the virus’s genetic code could, in theory,
be produced in a single day. Despite trying for decades, 
we still don’t have a vaccine. But we do have an effective
cocktail of HIV drugs that the virus can’t easily mutate 
away from. Unfortunately, 
we are stuck with colds for now. But the last few decades have featured
some entirely game-changing medical breakthroughs,
like mRNA vaccines and CRISPR. CRISPR could be particularly promising
as an antiviral agent, because it originally evolved in bacteria
as an immune defense against viruses. In fact, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a research team showed that 
a CRISPR system could degrade coronavirus and influenza genomes
in our lung cells. They called their system prophylactic
antiviral CRISPR in human cells. Or, for short, PAC-MAN.

**Transcript**:
In 2000, a company called ViroPharma
ran clinical trials of pleconaril, a new pill designed to treat 
the common cold. In many patients, the pill helped. But in 7 of them, 
just a few days into the treatment, researchers found mutated virus variants
that were almost completely resistant to pleconaril. Viruses are always mutating, but this one
mutated so quickly that it managed to outmaneuver years of research 
and development in just a few days. If you didn't have an immune
system and caught a cold, the infection would quickly spread
deep into your lungs. Rampant viral replication would destroy
tissue there, until your lungs couldn’t supply your body
with enough oxygen and you’d asphyxiate. Unfortunately, for millions of people
around the world who live with a less-than-fully-functional
immune system or who are on immunosuppressant drugs, this is a real risk: “minor” infections can turn serious
or even deadly. But if you're fortunate enough to have
a fully functional immune system, a cold will probably give you 
a few relatively mild symptoms. On average, adults catch more than
150 colds throughout their lives. And despite the fact 
that the symptoms are similar, the cause could be different each time. Common colds are caused by at least
8 different families of virus, each of which can have 
its own species and subtypes. How can so many different viruses
cause the same illness? Well, viruses can only invade
our bodies in a few ways: one is to come in on a breath. We have to breathe, so our immune system 
sets up a bunch of frontline defenses and these are actually what produce
many of the symptoms of a cold. Your mucus-y, dripping nose is your immune

**Transcript**:
In South Africa, one of the most
unequal countries in the world, the richest one-tenth of 1%, owns 
almost 30% of all the country’s wealth, more than double what the bottom 90% owns. Income and wealth inequality are not new. In fact, economists and historians 
who’ve charted economic inequality throughout history haven’t found 
a single society without it. Which raises a bleak question: is inequality inevitable? One way to estimate inequality is 
with a number called the Gini index, which is calculated by comparing 
the income or wealth distribution of a perfectly equal society to the 
actual income or wealth distribution. The area of this shape multiplied
by 2 is the Gini index. A Gini of 1 indicates
perfect inequality— one person has everything 
and everyone else has nothing. You’d never see this in real life because everyone except 
that one person would starve. A Gini index of 0 indicates
perfect equality— everyone has exactly 
the same income or wealth. But you also never see this in real life,
not even in communist countries, because for one thing, 
that would mean paying everyone— no matter how young, old,
what job they’re in or where they work— the exact same wage. Typical after-tax Ginis in developed
countries today are around 0.3, though there’s a wide range 
from pretty equal to pretty unequal. Before we go any further, you should
know what the Gini index— or any other measure of economic
inequality— doesn’t tell us: it gives no information about how 
income and wealth are distributed across genders, races, educational 
backgrounds or other demographics; it doesn’t tell us how easy or difficult
it is to escape poverty. And it also gives no insight 
as to how a particular society arrived at its present level 
of inequality. Economic inequality is deeply entangled
with other types of inequality: for example, generations 
of discrimination, imperialism, and colonialism created deeply rooted 
power and class inequalities that persist to this day. But we still need at least a rough measure
of who gets how much in a country. That’s what the Gini index gives us. Some countries are, economically,
much more unequal than others. And that’s because a significant portion
of economic inequality is the result of choices 
that governments make. Let's talk about some of these choices. First: what kind of economy to use. In the 20th century, some countries 
switched  to socialism or communism for a variety of reasons, including reducing economic inequality. These changes did dramatically
reduce economic inequality in the two largest 
non-capitalist economies, China and the Soviet Union—
especially in the Soviet Union. But neither country prospered as much
as the world's leading economies. So yes, people earned about as much
as their neighbors did, but that wasn’t very much. This— and many other issues— contributed 
to the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. And China, to grow more quickly,
shifted its economy towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s. What about capitalist countries? Can they choose to reduce
economic inequality? It’s tempting to think “no, because the whole point of 
capitalism is to hoard enough gold coins to be able to dive into them 
like Scrooge McDuck.” China seems to provide 
the textbook example of this: after it became more capitalist, its Gini index shot up from under 0.4
to over 0.55. Meanwhile, its per capita yearly income jumped from the rough equivalent 
of $1,500 to over $13,000. But there are many counter-examples: capitalist countries in which inequality
is actually holding steady or decreasing. France has kept its Gini index
below 0.32 since 1979. Ireland's Gini has been trending
mostly downward since 1995. The Netherlands and Denmark have kept
theirs below 0.28 since the 1980s. How do they do it? One way is with taxes. Personal income taxes in most
countries are progressive: the more money you make, 
the higher your tax rate. And the more progressive your tax system,
the more it reduces inequality. So, for example, while pre-tax income
inequality in France is roughly the same as it is in the US, post-tax inequality in France
is roughly 20% lower. Meanwhile, inheritance taxes can reduce
the amount of wealth that a single family can amass
over generations. Germany and many other European
countries have inheritance or estate taxes that kick in at a few thousand
to a few hundred thousand Euros, depending on who's inheriting. The US, on the other hand, lets you inherit $12 million 
without paying any federal tax. Another way is with transfers— when the government takes tax revenues
from one group of people and gives it to another. For example, Social Security programs 
tax people who work and use the revenue to support retirees. In Italy, about a quarter of Italians’
disposable household income comes from government transfers. That’s a lot, 
especially relative to the US, where the figure is just over 5%. A third way is to ensure that everyone
has access to things like education and healthcare. A highly educated, healthy workforce can 
command a higher salary on the market, thus reducing inequality. The fourth way
is addressing the digital divide: the gap between those who have access 
to the Internet and those who do not. A fifth way is dealing
with extreme wealth. Multibillionaires can buy 
social media platforms, news outlets, policy think-tanks,
perhaps even politicians, and bend them to their will, threatening the very fabric of democracy. We are just barely scratching 
the surface of inequality here. We haven’t touched on the drastic divides
in who has wealth and who doesn’t; the power structures that prevent
social and economic mobility; and the drastic inequality 
between countries— the fact that, for example, just three Americans have 
90 billion more dollars than Egypt, a country of 100 million people. And here’s one final thing to think about:
power and wealth are self-reinforcing, which means that equality is not. Left to their own devices, 
societies tend toward inequality— unless we weaken the feedback loops 
of wealth and power concentration.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to astronomy, while the ground truth MCQ is about the Gini index, which is a measure of economic inequality.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to provide an index, I would say -1 or "No match" because there is no generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In South Africa, one of the most
unequal countries in the world, the richest one-tenth of 1%, owns 
almost 30% of all the country’s wealth, more than double what the bottom 90% owns. Income and wealth inequality are not new. In fact, economists and historians 
who’ve charted economic inequality throughout history haven’t found 
a single society without it. Which raises a bleak question: is inequality inevitable? One way to estimate inequality is 
with a number called the Gini index, which is calculated by comparing 
the income or wealth distribution of a perfectly equal society to the 
actual income or wealth distribution. The area of this shape multiplied
by 2 is the Gini index. A Gini of 1 indicates
perfect inequality— one person has everything 
and everyone else has nothing. You’d never see this in real life because everyone except 
that one person would starve. A Gini index of 0 indicates
perfect equality— everyone has exactly 
the same income or wealth. But you also never see this in real life,
not even in communist countries, because for one thing, 
that would mean paying everyone— no matter how young, old,
what job they’re in or where they work— the exact same wage. Typical after-tax Ginis in developed
countries today are around 0.3, though there’s a wide range 
from pretty equal to pretty unequal. Before we go any further, you should
know what the Gini index— or any other measure of economic
inequality— doesn’t tell us: it gives no information about how 
income and wealth are distributed across genders, races, educational 
backgrounds or other demographics; it doesn’t tell us how easy or difficult
it is to escape poverty. And it also gives no insight 
as to how a particular society arrived at its present level 
of inequality. Economic inequality is deeply entangled
with other types of inequality: for example, generations 
of discrimination, imperialism, and colonialism created deeply rooted 
power and class inequalities that persist to this day. But we still need at least a rough measure
of who gets how much in a country. That’s what the Gini index gives us. Some countries are, economically,
much more unequal than others. And that’s because a significant portion
of economic inequality is the result of choices 
that governments make. Let's talk about some of these choices. First: what kind of economy to use. In the 20th century, some countries 
switched  to socialism or communism for a variety of reasons, including reducing economic inequality. These changes did dramatically
reduce economic inequality in the two largest 
non-capitalist economies, China and the Soviet Union—
especially in the Soviet Union. But neither country prospered as much
as the world's leading economies. So yes, people earned about as much
as their neighbors did, but that wasn’t very much. This— and many other issues— contributed 
to the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. And China, to grow more quickly,
shifted its economy towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s. What about capitalist countries? Can they choose to reduce
economic inequality? It’s tempting to think “no, because the whole point of 
capitalism is to hoard enough gold coins to be able to dive into them 
like Scrooge McDuck.” China seems to provide 
the textbook example of this: after it became more capitalist, its Gini index shot up from under 0.4
to over 0.55. Meanwhile, its per capita yearly income jumped from the rough equivalent 
of $1,500 to over $13,000. But there are many counter-examples: capitalist countries in which inequality
is actually holding steady or decreasing. France has kept its Gini index
below 0.32 since 1979. Ireland's Gini has been trending
mostly downward since 1995. The Netherlands and Denmark have kept
theirs below 0.28 since the 1980s. How do they do it? One way is with taxes. Personal income taxes in most
countries are progressive: the more money you make, 
the higher your tax rate. And the more progressive your tax system,
the more it reduces inequality. So, for example, while pre-tax income
inequality in France is roughly the same as it is in the US, post-tax inequality in France
is roughly 20% lower. Meanwhile, inheritance taxes can reduce
the amount of wealth that a single family can amass
over generations. Germany and many other European
countries have inheritance or estate taxes that kick in at a few thousand
to a few hundred thousand Euros, depending on who's inheriting. The US, on the other hand, lets you inherit $12 million 
without paying any federal tax. Another way is with transfers— when the government takes tax revenues
from one group of people and gives it to another. For example, Social Security programs 
tax people who work and use the revenue to support retirees. In Italy, about a quarter of Italians’
disposable household income comes from government transfers. That’s a lot, 
especially relative to the US, where the figure is just over 5%. A third way is to ensure that everyone
has access to things like education and healthcare. A highly educated, healthy workforce can 
command a higher salary on the market, thus reducing inequality. The fourth way
is addressing the digital divide: the gap between those who have access 
to the Internet and those who do not. A fifth way is dealing
with extreme wealth. Multibillionaires can buy 
social media platforms, news outlets, policy think-tanks,
perhaps even politicians, and bend them to their will, threatening the very fabric of democracy. We are just barely scratching 
the surface of inequality here. We haven’t touched on the drastic divides
in who has wealth and who doesn’t; the power structures that prevent
social and economic mobility; and the drastic inequality 
between countries— the fact that, for example, just three Americans have 
90 billion more dollars than Egypt, a country of 100 million people. And here’s one final thing to think about:
power and wealth are self-reinforcing, which means that equality is not. Left to their own devices, 
societies tend toward inequality— unless we weaken the feedback loops 
of wealth and power concentration.

Everyone loves the idea of parallel universes
- maybe it's the appeal of an ideal world where you have second chances and things turn
out differently - an alternate reality where you do get into Hogwarts and the Star Wars
prequels aren't made and you finally plug in your asymmetric computer cord correctly
on the first try... but is there really a place in science for such wistful speculation? I mean, if "the universe" is everything that
there is, you can't have two versions of it, right? Otherwise the pair would really be everything
and what you started off calling the universe, wasn't. The problem here is terminology: physicists
speaking informally often say "universe" when they really mean "observable universe" - that
is, the part of the whole universe that we've so far been able to see. And it's perfectly fine to talk about multiple
different observable universes - for example, an alien near the edge of OUR observable universe
will see parts of the Whole Universe that we cannot yet see, but that's a well-understood
question and not what physicists normally talk about when they discuss multiple observable
universes, or "multi-verses." So let's cut to the chase: in physics, the
word "Multiverse" normally refers to one of three distinct and largely unrelated proposed
physical models for the universe - none of which has been tested or confirmed by experiment,
by the way. The three "multiverse" models are: Type 1) Bubble universes or baby black hole
universes. This is the most straightforward kind of multiverse:
the basic idea is that perhaps there are other parts of the universe which are so far away
that we will never see them (or are inside black holes so similarly we will never see
them). This kind of model was created as an attempt
to explain why our universe is so good at making stars and galaxies and black holes
and life - as the argument goes, if each of these separate mutually un-seeable "bubbles"
in the universe had slightly different laws of physics, then by definition we could only
exist in one that had the right physical laws to allow us to exist. If you're not convinced by this logic, don't
worry too much: there's not yet any experimental evidence for this kind of multiverse. Multiverse type 2) Membranes and extra dimensions. Inspired in part by the inability of the mathematics
of string theory to predict the right number of dimensions for the universe in which we
live, string theorists proposed the idea that perhaps what we think of as our universe is
actually just a three-dimensional surface embedded within a larger super-universe with
9 spatial dimensions. Kind of like how each page of a newspaper
is its own two-dimensional surface embedded within our three-dimensional world. And of course, if space had 9 dimensions rather
than three, there'd be plenty of space for other three-dimensional surfaces that appeared,
like ours, to be universes in their own right, but, like the pages of a newspaper, were actually
part of a bigger whole. These kinds of surfaces are called "membranes"
or "branes" for short. And as a reminder, there is not yet any experimental
evidence for this kind of multiverse. Multiverse type 3) The many-worlds picture
of quantum mechanics. Surprisingly, physicists still don't fully
understand how the collapse of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics happens, and the many-worlds
hypothesis makes an attempt at explanation by proposing that every possible alternate
timeline for the universe is real and they all happen in an ever-larger, ever-branching
way. Like, a universal choose-your-own-adventure
where every possible story happens! If this were the case, we might not realize
it because we'd be stuck living out just one of the infinitely many possible lives available
to us. In some ways, many-worlds is similar to the
bubble multiverse model by proposing "maybe anything that can happen, does. And we just happen to exist in the series
of happenings that were necessary for us to exist." If you're still not convinced by this logic,
don't worry: there is not yet any experimental evidence for this kind of multiverse. Of course if you want to get imaginative,
you could also combine several of these models together into a multi-multiverse... a new
super-speculative model based, itself, on speculative and experimentally unconfirmed
models. But that's not to say we couldn't test these
multiverse hypotheses. For example, if our observable universe were
really just one of many disconnected bubbles or membranes and if it happened to collide
with another bubble or membrane some time in the past, then that collision would certainly
have had some sort of effect on what we see when we look up at the night sky. On the other hand, the many-worlds interpretation
might be tested fairly soon since experimentalists are becoming increasingly able to manipulate
and control ever-larger quantum mechanical systems in their labs - systems that approach
the line between the quantum realm and our everyday experience. So as always, we must remember that physics
is science, not philosophy; and in our attempts to explain the universe that we observe, we
have to make claims that can in principle be tested - and then test them!

On February 7th, 1967, Homer Loutzenheuser
flipped a switch in Nebraska and realized a dream more than 
five decades in the making. The power grids 
of the United States joined together, forming one interconnected machine
stretching coast to coast. Today, the US power grid is the
world's largest machine. It contains more than 7,300 
electricity-generating plants, linked by some 11 million kilometers of 
powerlines, transformers and substations. Power grids span Earth’s continents,
transmitting electricity around the clock. They’re massive feats of engineering— but their functioning depends
on a delicate balance. Their components must always
work in unison, maintain a constant frequency
throughout the grid, and match energy supply with demand. If there's too much electricity
in the system, you get unsafe power spikes that can
overheat and damage equipment. Too little electricity 
and you get blackouts. So, to strike this balance, power grid operators monitor the grid
from sophisticated control centers. They forecast energy demand 
and adjust which power plants are active, signaling them to turn their output 
up or down to precisely meet current demand. By considering factors like the 
availability and cost of energy resources, grid operators create a “dispatch curve,” which maps out the order in which energy
sources will be used. The grid defaults to using energy 
from the start of the curve first. Usually, the resources are
ordered by price. Those at the start tend to be renewables because they have much lower
production costs. Some grids, like those 
in Iceland and Costa Rica, run on more than 98% clean energy. But most dispatch curves contain
more of a mix of carbon-free and carbon-emitting
energy sources. This means that where your electricity
is coming from— and how clean it is— 
varies throughout the day— as often as every few minutes. Take the state of Kansas. Despite having plentiful wind resources, it regularly relies on carbon-emitting 
power plants. This is because wind energy is especially
plentiful at night. But, this is also when 
there’s lower demand. So, Kansas’s wind energy 
is actually regularly disposed of to prevent excess electricity 
from damaging the grid. And comparable scenarios
add up to a big problem worldwide. Thankfully, dependence on renewables
is rising. But power grids are often unable
to make full use of them. Many simply weren't designed around
intermittent energy sources and can't store large amounts
of electricity. Researchers are experimenting 
with unique storage solutions. However, this will take time
and substantial investment. But hope is not lost. We have the opportunity to work with
our existing power grids in a new way: by shifting some of our energy use to the times when there’s clean 
electricity to spare. Leaning into this concept,
called “load flexibility,” we can help flatten the peaks in demand, which will place less stress on the grid
and reduce the need for non-renewables. So researchers are developing 
automated emissions reduction technologies that tap into energy use data and ensure that devices get electricity 
from the grid at the cleanest times. In fact, smart devices 
like this already exist. So, how big an effect could they have? If smart technologies like
air conditioners, water heaters, and electric vehicle chargers were 
implemented across the Texas power grid, the state’s emissions could 
decrease by around 20%. In other words, simply coordinating
when certain devices tap into the grid could translate to 6 million fewer tons 
of carbon released into the atmosphere 
annually from Texas alone. Now, imagine what this could look
like on a global scale.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to animation and rendering, while the ground truth MCQ is related to power grids and energy management.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one that is vaguely similar in terms of having a process or system being controlled or managed, I would say Question 2 is the closest, but it is still not similar.

So the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be: 2 (but with the caveat that it's not actually similar).

he took a deep breath, and in one sudden movement, drew his sickle 
and brought it down on her neck. Medusa’s head rolled to the ground 
and from her neck sprung two children. One of them was Chrysaor, 
a giant wielding a golden sword; The other was the magnificent,
white, winged horse, Pegasus. He was swifter than any other steed,
and with the stomp of his hooves, he could alter mountains 
and draw streams from dry rock. No bridle could contain him—
until one fateful day. Bellerophon, prince
of the Greek city-state of Corinth, seemed to have it all. But his ambitions
exceeded his earthly circumstances. What he truly wanted was 
to be a hero so great that the gods would welcome him
on Mount Olympus. Bellerophon believed that Pegasus would be
key in helping him reach such heights. One night, 
he visited the temple of Athena, the goddess of war and wisdom, and prayed for the power 
to appease the mighty animal. When Bellerophon woke, 
he found a magical golden bridle, and sped to the fountain 
that Pegasus drank from. As soon as the horse bent
towards the water, Bellerophon jumped on his back
and slipped the bridle on. Finally, Pegasus was subdued. With this conquest, Bellerophon felt
that he was on his way to becoming a legendary hero. He trained for battle day and night. But one training session
went horribly wrong, and Bellerophon mortally injured 
his brother, Deliades. Disgraced, he was exiled to Argos, 
where King Proetus purified him. Bellerophon was resolved 
to repair his reputation, but the Queen of Argos had her eye on him. And when Bellerophon rebuffed
her advances, she accused him of trying to seduce her,
further tarnishing his honor. King Proetus soon devised
a plan to exact revenge. He banished Bellerophon and Pegasus 
and sent them to the kingdom of Lycia, carrying a note to Iobates, Lycia’s king. But unbeknownst to Bellerophon, he was
carrying a decree for his own death. Iobates considered how to dispose
of the youth and picked just the right monster
for the job: the fire-breathing lion-goat-dragon 
Chimera that had long been
terrorizing his kingdom. Bellerophon— eager to achieve greatness—
jumped at the challenge. He mounted Pegasus,
and the two shot into the sky. Swooping above the earth, they saw the 
Chimera surrounded by its charred victims. Soon, they too were facing its firepower. In a sequence of agile aerial acrobatics, Pegasus dodged every blast
from the Chimera as Bellerophon launched his arrows. Finally, Pegasus closed in on the beast
at just the right angle, and Bellerophon dealt it a deadly blow. Iobates was incredulous. He was glad to be rid of the monster, 
but still needed to deal with Bellerophon. So, he set forth more challenges, putting Bellerophon up against 
fearsome warriors, highly skilled archers, and, ultimately,
Lycia’s best soldiers. Every time, Pegasus’ power turned the tide
in Bellerophon’s favor. Finally, Iobates had no choice 
but to  concede that Bellerophon was a true hero. He even offered him 
his daughter’s hand in marriage. But Bellerophon’s sights were set far
beyond the land of mortals. He was certain he must now be entitled
to a place on Mount Olympus. So, he jumped onto Pegasus 
and urged him higher and higher. Zeus watched as Bellerophon,
buoyed by hubris, neared his palace. To punish the youth, 
he released a single gadfly, which beelined towards Pegasus 
and bit into his flesh. This was as high 
as Bellerophon would ever get. As Pegasus flinched, 
he flung his rider into the air, and Bellerophon fell careening
back to Earth. Pegasus, on the other hand, 
ascended with Zeus’s blessing. The gods welcomed him into the halls 
of Mount Olympus and immortalized him in a constellation. There in the night sky, 
Pegasus can be seen soaring, unfettered and free.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the James Webb Space Telescope, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about the mythological figure Pegasus.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in structure and intent, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match. This question asks about a hypothesis regarding the possibility of life on Europa, which is a question about a specific entity (Europa) and its relationship to a particular concept (life). Similarly, the ground truth MCQ asks about the parentage of Pegasus.

But again, I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ, and Question 5 is only a very rough approximation.

Index: 5 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in terms of question type (i.e., asking about a location), I would say that Question 6 is the closest match, but it's still not similar in terms of content and options.

A more suitable approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the story of Bellerophon and Pegasus, and then try to find a match among those generated MCQs.

If you provide a new set of generated MCQs that are related to the story of Bellerophon and Pegasus, I would be happy to help you find a match.

**Transcript**:
Shielded from the gorgon’s 
stone-cold gaze, Perseus crept through Medusa’s cave. When he reached her, 
he took a deep breath, and in one sudden movement, drew his sickle 
and brought it down on her neck. Medusa’s head rolled to the ground 
and from her neck sprung two children. One of them was Chrysaor, 
a giant wielding a golden sword; The other was the magnificent,
white, winged horse, Pegasus. He was swifter than any other steed,
and with the stomp of his hooves, he could alter mountains 
and draw streams from dry rock. No bridle could contain him—
until one fateful day. Bellerophon, prince
of the Greek city-state of Corinth, seemed to have it all. But his ambitions
exceeded his earthly circumstances. What he truly wanted was 
to be a hero so great that the gods would welcome him
on Mount Olympus. Bellerophon believed that Pegasus would be
key in helping him reach such heights. One night, 
he visited the temple of Athena, the goddess of war and wisdom, and prayed for the power 
to appease the mighty animal. When Bellerophon woke, 
he found a magical golden bridle, and sped to the fountain 
that Pegasus drank from. As soon as the horse bent
towards the water, Bellerophon jumped on his back
and slipped the bridle on. Finally, Pegasus was subdued. With this conquest, Bellerophon felt
that he was on his way to becoming a legendary hero. He trained for battle day and night. But one training session
went horribly wrong, and Bellerophon mortally injured 
his brother, Deliades. Disgraced, he was exiled to Argos, 
where King Proetus purified him. Bellerophon was resolved 
to repair his reputation, but the Queen of Argos had her eye on him. And when Bellerophon rebuffed
her advances, she accused him of trying to seduce her,
further tarnishing his honor. King Proetus soon devised
a plan to exact revenge. He banished Bellerophon and Pegasus 
and sent them to the kingdom of Lycia, carrying a note to Iobates, Lycia’s king. But unbeknownst to Bellerophon, he was
carrying a decree for his own death. Iobates considered how to dispose
of the youth and picked just the right monster
for the job: the fire-breathing lion-goat-dragon 
Chimera that had long been
terrorizing his kingdom. Bellerophon— eager to achieve greatness—
jumped at the challenge. He mounted Pegasus,
and the two shot into the sky. Swooping above the earth, they saw the 
Chimera surrounded by its charred victims. Soon, they too were facing its firepower. In a sequence of agile aerial acrobatics, Pegasus dodged every blast
from the Chimera as Bellerophon launched his arrows. Finally, Pegasus closed in on the beast
at just the right angle, and Bellerophon dealt it a deadly blow. Iobates was incredulous. He was glad to be rid of the monster, 
but still needed to deal with Bellerophon. So, he set forth more challenges, putting Bellerophon up against 
fearsome warriors, highly skilled archers, and, ultimately,
Lycia’s best soldiers. Every time, Pegasus’ power turned the tide
in Bellerophon’s favor. Finally, Iobates had no choice 
but to  concede that Bellerophon was a true hero. He even offered him 
his daughter’s hand in marriage. But Bellerophon’s sights were set far
beyond the land of mortals. He was certain he must now be entitled
to a place on Mount Olympus. So, he jumped onto Pegasus 
and urged him higher and higher. Zeus watched as Bellerophon,
buoyed by hubris, neared his palace. To punish the youth, 
he released a single gadfly, which beelined towards Pegasus 
and bit into his flesh. This was as high 
as Bellerophon would ever get. As Pegasus flinched, 
he flung his rider into the air, and Bellerophon fell careening
back to Earth. Pegasus, on the other hand, 
ascended with Zeus’s blessing. The gods welcomed him into the halls 
of Mount Olympus and immortalized him in a constellation. There in the night sky, 
Pegasus can be seen soaring, unfettered and free.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the James Webb Space Telescope, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the story of Bellerophon and Pegasus.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in structure and intent, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match. This question asks about a hypothesis regarding the possibility of life on Europa, and it has a similar structure to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about Zeus's actions to punish Bellerophon.

But again, I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ, and it would be best to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

Index: None (or 5, if you want to consider a very loose match)

**Transcript**:
Today is the one year anniversary 
of the best-worst day of your life. The best part was discovering
a subterranean city on Mars: the first evidence of intelligent 
alien life ever found. The worst part? No one got to explore it, because that was when you lost contact
with Earth. You and the other 99 scientists
have spent the rest of the year engineering your survival, but you’re almost out of water 
and solutions. Everyone else is at the ice cap, but you’ve decided to investigate
the buried city to see if there are clues to how their
civilization survived on a desert planet. The city is mostly ruins 
except for three intact pyramids— two open and one sealed. In the first you find a series 
of symbols and pictograms, revealing a fortuitously 
base 10 numbering system. The second pyramid’s facade 
is covered in these symbols. Inside you discover a device, as well as mosaic representations
of how to use it. From those you glean the following: the device is the key to opening 
the sealed pyramid by inputting the number 
on the center block. But if you put in the wrong number,
something terrible and deadly will happen. The doors to all pyramids work
on the same principle. What number should you input to open
the door to the sealed pyramid? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The pattern revealed by the second
pyramid is that every number is the sum of the two numbers
directly beneath it. If that applies to the sealed pyramid,
40 clearly belongs to the left of 30. The center number is the sum of 7
and an unknown, call it x. The value of x can be determined
by trial and error, but it’s quicker to use
algebraic reasoning. The number to the left of the center
number is 5+x. Therefore, this block, 40, 
is equal to 5+x plus 7+x. Solving for x, x must be 14, 
making the central block 21. You enter 21 on the remote, 
and the door opens! Inside you find yet another riddle. The walls show the history
of this civilization. When they lived here, the planet
was covered with oceans. But at a certain point, 
they up and left Mars. In order to reserve the planet 
for themselves while making it inhospitable to others, they moved all the water underground, using a gigantic engineering marvel
activated by a single lever. The lever is hidden in the Great Pyramid. Pulling the lever again would reverse 
the process, and bring the water back to the surface. But where is this Great Pyramid? The mosaics indicate it should be 
right here, but it’s clearly not. Without it, you have no choice but to
climb back out of the city to the surface. And that’s when you see it. The city is the final pyramid,
or at least one face of it. A great pyramid, indeed! The city’s architects must have 
designed each district to show a number when viewed from above. But only these three survived
the ravages of time. The key once again must be whatever
number was in the center plaza. You rush there, but what number should
you input into the remote? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could write out the algebra again,
but here’s a more visual approach. Sketch a pyramid,
and enter the known numbers. Between the 9 and the 10, you can put colored dots to represent
the two unknowns at the bottom. Working your way up the pyramid
and drawing the sums as you go will reveal that 100 = 19 + 3 green dots + 3 orange dots. So 3(green + orange)=81, and green + orange, 
which is the middle number, must be 27. You don’t actually have to figure
out what green and orange are— in fact, 
they have a number of possibilities. When you enter 27, a hidden mechanism 
opens in the middle of the plaza, revealing a staircase. You descend, and finally find yourself in a room 
with a giant lever in the middle. Only one question remains:
do you pull it?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the pyramid rule that governs the numbers on the pyramid?
Options: A. Any number can be written anywhere., B. Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly beneath it., C. Each number is the product of the two numbers directly beneath it., D. Each number is the same as another number in the same pyramid.
Correct Option: B

the door to the sealed pyramid? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The pattern revealed by the second
pyramid is that every number is the sum of the two numbers
directly beneath it. If that applies to the sealed pyramid,
40 clearly belongs to the left of 30. The center number is the sum of 7
and an unknown, call it x. The value of x can be determined
by trial and error, but it’s quicker to use
algebraic reasoning. The number to the left of the center
number is 5+x. Therefore, this block, 40, 
is equal to 5+x plus 7+x. Solving for x, x must be 14, 
making the central block 21. You enter 21 on the remote, 
and the door opens! Inside you find yet another riddle. The walls show the history
of this civilization. When they lived here, the planet
was covered with oceans. But at a certain point, 
they up and left Mars. In order to reserve the planet 
for themselves while making it inhospitable to others, they moved all the water underground, using a gigantic engineering marvel
activated by a single lever. The lever is hidden in the Great Pyramid. Pulling the lever again would reverse 
the process, and bring the water back to the surface. But where is this Great Pyramid? The mosaics indicate it should be 
right here, but it’s clearly not. Without it, you have no choice but to
climb back out of the city to the surface. And that’s when you see it. The city is the final pyramid,
or at least one face of it. A great pyramid, indeed! The city’s architects must have 
designed each district to show a number when viewed from above. But only these three survived
the ravages of time. The key once again must be whatever
number was in the center plaza. You rush there, but what number should
you input into the remote? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could write out the algebra again,
but here’s a more visual approach. Sketch a pyramid,
and enter the known numbers. Between the 9 and the 10, you can put colored dots to represent
the two unknowns at the bottom. Working your way up the pyramid
and drawing the sums as you go will reveal that 100 = 19 + 3 green dots + 3 orange dots. So 3(green + orange)=81, and green + orange, 
which is the middle number, must be 27. You don’t actually have to figure
out what green and orange are— in fact, 
they have a number of possibilities. When you enter 27, a hidden mechanism 
opens in the middle of the plaza, revealing a staircase. You descend, and finally find yourself in a room 
with a giant lever in the middle. Only one question remains:
do you pull it?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to termite colonies, while the ground truth MCQ is related to a mathematical puzzle from the provided transcript.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the question intent, options, and content, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say Question 8 is the most similar, but only because it has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ (i.e., it has four options and asks a question that requires some analysis). However, the content and intent of Question 8 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would not recommend using any of the generated MCQs as a match for the ground truth MCQ.

Index: None (or 8, but with a strong caveat that it's not a good match)

Today is the one year anniversary

if you're an astronomy Enthusiast September end will be an exciting time that's because the biggest planet in the solar system will be at its closest to Earth in the last 59 years as it reaches its opposition from the Viewpoint of Earth's surface an opposition happens when an astronomical object rises in the east as the sun sets in the west placing the object and the sun on opposite sides of Earth according to NASA Jupiter's opposition occurs every 13 months making the planet appear larger and brighter than any other time of the year but that's not all Jupiter will also make its closest approach to Earth in the last 59 years this happens because Earth and Jupiter do not orbit the Sun in perfect circles meaning the planets will pass each other at different distances throughout the year Jupiter's closest approach to Earth rarely coincides with opposition which means this year's views will be extraordinary at its closest approach Jupiter would be approximately 367 million miles or 590 million kilometers from Earth about the same distance it was in 1963. the massive planet is about 600 million miles or 965 million kilometers away from Earth at its farthest point when a superior Planet reaches its opposition it rises in the east at Sunset reaches its highest point in the sky around midnight and sets in the west at dawn so Jupiter will shine brightly throughout the night well up in the night sky Jupiter is the brightest planet in the sky after Venus as seen from the Earth since Venus is only visible in the morning or evening Skies Jupiter will be the brightest Speck of light you'll see in the night sky the gas giant has 79 confirmed moons orbiting it and four of them can be easily seen through a modest telescope or even a pair of binoculars they're known as the Galilean moons named after Galileo Galilei who first discovered them in the 17th century with good binoculars the banding of Jupiter and three to four Galilean moons should be easily visible to see Jupiter's Great Red Spot and bans in more detail a four inch or larger telescope and some filters in the green to blue range would enhance the visibility of these features in binoculars or a telescope the Galilean satellites should appear as bright dots on either side of Jupiter during opposition an ideal viewing location will be at a high elevation in a dark and dry area The View should be great for a few days before and after September 26th so it would be best if you took advantage of good weather on either side of this date to take Insight if you look around in the night sky you should be able to see Saturn the ringed planet reached its opposition about a month ago and is slightly fainted Saturn Rises before Jupiter at dusk and reaches its highest point in the southern sky around midnight it's fairly bright and can be easily seen with the naked eye a telescopic view can reveal the beautiful rings of the planet as far as other planets concerned Mercury and Venus are still emerging from behind the Sun as a result they will remain hidden in its glare for the next few days Mars Rises around an hour before midnight and can be easily seen with unaided ice the red planet will reach its opposition on December 8 2022 hence as days pass by its distance from the earth will decrease and its apparent brightness will increase close to Mars lies Uranus at an apparent magnitude of 5.8 Neptune was at opposition on September 17th which means it's the best time of year to see the ice giant however Uranus and Neptune can only be seen through a telescope or a pair of binoculars the upcoming month is also going to be an exciting one for sky gazers October has as many as seven meteor showers in its store and the most significant one is the orionid meteor shower which Peaks around October 22nd besides that observers in parts of Africa Asia Europe and Greenland can witness a partial solar eclipse we'll cover the details in our monthly video of astronomical events if you enjoyed this video make sure to like it subscribe to our Channel and press the Bell icon so you don't miss any future astronomical events

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the number of confirmed moons of Jupiter, while the generated MCQs are related to the Boltzmann brain paradox and cosmology.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose an index, I would say -1 (not available) or "None" because there isn't a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What does it mean for a country
to have a healthy economy? What does a healthy economy 
even look like? Does it look like this? What about like this? Economist Kate Raworth shared a
pretty interesting answer to this question on the TED Interview podcast. And it challenges an idea that most
economists take for granted. We live— particularly in the West, 
particularly in the last 150 years— in a society that has a very strong belief
that growth is the sign of progress. And to a certain extent, it’s true. We love to see our kids grow. We love to see nature growing in spring. Growth is a wonderful,
healthy phase of life. But in our economies, it’s like we’ve
turned to Peter Pan economics— the economy that never wanted to grow up. It wanted to grow and grow and grow
forever. And it becomes this permanent phase. But we already know, in our own bodies,
in our own lives, that there’s another side to this metaphor
of growth that we love so much. If I told you, my friend
had gone to the doctor, and the doctor told her she had a growth, that already feels completely different. Because in the space of our own bodies, we know that when something 
tries to grow endlessly within this healthy, dynamic living whole, it is a threat to the health of the whole, and we do everything we can to stop it. But when we step into our economies,
for some reason, we think that endless growth is progress. And we are now running
into severe problems because we are addicted to endless growth. Simon Kuznets, he was asked in the 1930s
by US Congress to come up, for the first time, with a single number 
to measure the output of the economy. America could say we produced so many tons
of steel and so many bags of grain— but can we add it all together? So they commissioned him 
to do this and he said, “Yes, I can. I can add it all together
in one number.” National income, what we now know as GDP—
but he gave it with a caveat. He said the welfare of a nation can
scarcely be known from this number, don’t mix it up with welfare, right? Because it tells us nothing about 
the unpaid caring work of parents, tells us nothing about the value
that’s created in communities, because that’s not priced, and it’s a measure of the flow 
of economic value. It tells us nothing about the
living world, the forests, the mines that get run down in order
to create this value. But the convenience, the temptation,
of this single number was so great that politicians sort of tucked it 
in their armpit and carried right on. And we ended up in a horse race
of pursuing GDP growth. The dream is that GDP can
keep on increasing, we can have increasing financial returns, but that we can decouple
from using Earth’s resources. We can use less carbon and less metals,
and minerals and plastics, and we can use less 
of the Earth’s land surface, and separate these two: 
ever rising GDP and falling resource use. It’s a fabulous dream; 
would that it would be true. We are at a time of climate emergency,
of ecosystem collapse. We need to radically reduce 
our use of Earth’s resources, and we're nowhere close to that. So I offer it as a compass for 21st
century prosperity. And this compass, silly though it sounds, it looks like a doughnut 
with the hole in the middle. So imagine from the center of it,
humanity’s use of Earth’s resources radiating out from the middle
of that picture. So in the hole, 
in the middle of the doughnut, that is the place where people 
don’t have enough resources to meet the essentials of life. It’s where people don’t have enough
food or health care, or education or housing or gender equality
or political voice or access to energy. And we want to leave nobody in that hole. We want to get everybody over a social
foundation of well-being, so all people on this planet can
lead lives of dignity and opportunity and community. And in low income countries, 
it absolutely makes sense, yes, let’s see the economy grow in ways 
that invest in health and education and transport for all. That was a very 20th century project. We're in the 21st century. We have Earth system scientists
who started looking at the impact we were having on the climate,
and the loss of soils and acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer,
and the collapse of species. And they said, hang on. We’ve been ignoring our planet. In the growing to meet human needs, 
we have ignored the fact that we are deeply dependent 
on this delicately balanced living planet. It’s the only one we know of out there. And when we use Earth’s resources 
in such a way that we begin to push ourselves beyond
the living capacities of this planet, we are literally undermining the life
supporting systems on which we depend. So, hang on, just as there’s 
an inner limit of resource use, and we call out poverty and deprivation, there’s an outer limit of humanity’s
resource use. That’s ecological degradation. And we are breaking down
this planet on which we depend. So there you get the doughnut,
you get the inside, which is leave nobody behind in the hole. But don’t overshoot the outer ring either. And so the shape of progress
is fundamentally changed. It’s no longer this ever rising line
exponential growth, that we hear about in the financial news 
all the time. It’s balance. To me, a source of real hope is 
that we deeply understand this at the level of our body. You go to the doctor, the doctor will say, have enough food, but not too much, 
enough water, oxygen, exercise, sleep, anything you like— 
have enough, but not too much. Our health lies in balance. And if we can take that metaphor 
from the human body to the planetary body, we give ourselves a cracking
chance of understanding the deep interdependence of our world.

**Transcript**:
What does it mean for a country
to have a healthy economy? What does a healthy economy 
even look like? Does it look like this? What about like this? Economist Kate Raworth shared a
pretty interesting answer to this question on the TED Interview podcast. And it challenges an idea that most
economists take for granted. We live— particularly in the West, 
particularly in the last 150 years— in a society that has a very strong belief
that growth is the sign of progress. And to a certain extent, it’s true. We love to see our kids grow. We love to see nature growing in spring. Growth is a wonderful,
healthy phase of life. But in our economies, it’s like we’ve
turned to Peter Pan economics— the economy that never wanted to grow up. It wanted to grow and grow and grow
forever. And it becomes this permanent phase. But we already know, in our own bodies,
in our own lives, that there’s another side to this metaphor
of growth that we love so much. If I told you, my friend
had gone to the doctor, and the doctor told her she had a growth, that already feels completely different. Because in the space of our own bodies, we know that when something 
tries to grow endlessly within this healthy, dynamic living whole, it is a threat to the health of the whole, and we do everything we can to stop it. But when we step into our economies,
for some reason, we think that endless growth is progress. And we are now running
into severe problems because we are addicted to endless growth. Simon Kuznets, he was asked in the 1930s
by US Congress to come up, for the first time, with a single number 
to measure the output of the economy. America could say we produced so many tons
of steel and so many bags of grain— but can we add it all together? So they commissioned him 
to do this and he said, “Yes, I can. I can add it all together
in one number.” National income, what we now know as GDP—
but he gave it with a caveat. He said the welfare of a nation can
scarcely be known from this number, don’t mix it up with welfare, right? Because it tells us nothing about 
the unpaid caring work of parents, tells us nothing about the value
that’s created in communities, because that’s not priced, and it’s a measure of the flow 
of economic value. It tells us nothing about the
living world, the forests, the mines that get run down in order
to create this value. But the convenience, the temptation,
of this single number was so great that politicians sort of tucked it 
in their armpit and carried right on. And we ended up in a horse race
of pursuing GDP growth. The dream is that GDP can
keep on increasing, we can have increasing financial returns, but that we can decouple
from using Earth’s resources. We can use less carbon and less metals,
and minerals and plastics, and we can use less 
of the Earth’s land surface, and separate these two: 
ever rising GDP and falling resource use. It’s a fabulous dream; 
would that it would be true. We are at a time of climate emergency,
of ecosystem collapse. We need to radically reduce 
our use of Earth’s resources, and we're nowhere close to that. So I offer it as a compass for 21st
century prosperity. And this compass, silly though it sounds, it looks like a doughnut 
with the hole in the middle. So imagine from the center of it,
humanity’s use of Earth’s resources radiating out from the middle
of that picture. So in the hole, 
in the middle of the doughnut, that is the place where people 
don’t have enough resources to meet the essentials of life. It’s where people don’t have enough
food or health care, or education or housing or gender equality
or political voice or access to energy. And we want to leave nobody in that hole. We want to get everybody over a social
foundation of well-being, so all people on this planet can
lead lives of dignity and opportunity and community. And in low income countries, 
it absolutely makes sense, yes, let’s see the economy grow in ways 
that invest in health and education and transport for all. That was a very 20th century project. We're in the 21st century. We have Earth system scientists
who started looking at the impact we were having on the climate,
and the loss of soils and acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer,
and the collapse of species. And they said, hang on. We’ve been ignoring our planet. In the growing to meet human needs, 
we have ignored the fact that we are deeply dependent 
on this delicately balanced living planet. It’s the only one we know of out there. And when we use Earth’s resources 
in such a way that we begin to push ourselves beyond
the living capacities of this planet, we are literally undermining the life
supporting systems on which we depend. So, hang on, just as there’s 
an inner limit of resource use, and we call out poverty and deprivation, there’s an outer limit of humanity’s
resource use. That’s ecological degradation. And we are breaking down
this planet on which we depend. So there you get the doughnut,
you get the inside, which is leave nobody behind in the hole. But don’t overshoot the outer ring either. And so the shape of progress
is fundamentally changed. It’s no longer this ever rising line
exponential growth, that we hear about in the financial news 
all the time. It’s balance. To me, a source of real hope is 
that we deeply understand this at the level of our body. You go to the doctor, the doctor will say, have enough food, but not too much, 
enough water, oxygen, exercise, sleep, anything you like— 
have enough, but not too much. Our health lies in balance. And if we can take that metaphor 
from the human body to the planetary body, we give ourselves a cracking
chance of understanding the deep interdependence of our world.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The year is 1656. Your body is wracked 
by violent chills. Your head pounds,
your muscles are too weak to sit up, and you feel like rancid, hard-boiled eggs are squeezing out of your neck 
and armpits. In your feverish state, you see 
a strange-looking man approach, his face obscured by a beak-like mask,
his body covered from head to toe. He examines you 
and even without seeing his face, you know the diagnosis: you have the plague. The plague stands out as one of the most 
terrifying and destructive diseases in human history. It swept across large parts of Afro-
Eurasia in three separate pandemics starting in the 6th, 14th,
and 19th centuries; killed tens of millions of people, and had— in the best of cases— 
about a 40% survival rate. The European plague doctor, with his
beaked mask and wizard-like robes, is one of the images most popularly
associated with plague today. He’s often found in books and films 
about the 14th century pandemic known as the Black Death. The only problem is
that’s about as accurate as placing a modern surgeon at the court
of Louis the 14th in Versailles. The confusion is understandable though— the Black Death had several aftershocks, including a series of devastating
outbreaks in Western Europe during the 17th century. This is when the iconic plague doctor
actually emerged on the scene. First described in the early 17th century, the outfit consisted of a hood 
with crystal eyepieces and a beak filled with a pungent 
combination of herbs and compounds. This could include cinnamon, pepper,
turpentine, roast copper, and powdered viper flesh. This recipe was inspired by the famed
2nd century Greco-Roman physician Galen, and was thought to ward off poisoned air
known as miasma. People believed this bad air
spread plague after emanating from swamps and sources of decay, such as dead plants or animal carcasses. In earlier centuries, doctors across
Europe carried metal pomanders filled with similar mixtures, and it’s possible that the beak evolved
as a hands-free alternative. The rest of the costume, which included 
an oiled leather robe, boots and gloves, acted as kind of an early hazmat suit, likely designed to block miasma 
from entering through the skin’s pores. While this shows some basic understanding
that plague spread from one place to another, these doctors couldn’t know that,
in most cases, the true culprit was a tiny flea 
transmitting the bacteria, Yersinia pestis, 
from one person or animal to another. It’s possible that the plague doctor’s
outfit may have provided some unintentional protection 
from flea bites. However, not enough information
survives to know whether the costumed doctors fared any better than
their ordinarily robed counterparts. It's no surprise that this bizarre getup
has captured popular imagination, despite the fact that its use was limited
to a few places in Italy and France during the 17th and early 18th centuries. Even at the time, it was viewed
with macabre fascination and occasionally used to mock
the ineffective and corrupt practices of some physicians. Until the 20th century, there was 
no effective treatment for the plague, but that didn’t stop doctors— 
costumed or not— from trying. They consulted the works of earlier
physicians for guidance, did what they could to fend off miasma, and prescribed a variety 
of concoctions and antidotes. They also relied on pre-modern
medical mainstays. These could include bloodletting, which involved draining (sometimes 
concerningly large amounts of) blood in an attempt to remove poison 
or restore the body’s natural balance. Or cupping, where the rim 
of a heated glass was placed over swollen lymph nodes 
in hopes of making them burst sooner— a sign, when it occurred naturally,
that a plague patient was on the mend. Or— perhaps most painfully—
cautery, which involved lancing the lymph nodes
with a red-hot poker to release the blackened pus within. A lot has changed since their times. Modern medicine has given us the means
to quickly identify bacterial as well as viral threats and to effectively mobilize against them. We also have access to technologies
like test kits, masks to deter the spread 
of respiratory viruses, and vaccines; and we conduct robust trials to make
sure they’re safe and effective. But some things don’t change: we still depend on the courage
and compassion of medical professionals who voluntarily risk their lives against an invisible attacker to help
and comfort those who need it most.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The year is 1656. Your body is wracked 
by violent chills. Your head pounds,
your muscles are too weak to sit up, and you feel like rancid, hard-boiled eggs are squeezing out of your neck 
and armpits. In your feverish state, you see 
a strange-looking man approach, his face obscured by a beak-like mask,
his body covered from head to toe. He examines you 
and even without seeing his face, you know the diagnosis: you have the plague. The plague stands out as one of the most 
terrifying and destructive diseases in human history. It swept across large parts of Afro-
Eurasia in three separate pandemics starting in the 6th, 14th,
and 19th centuries; killed tens of millions of people, and had— in the best of cases— 
about a 40% survival rate. The European plague doctor, with his
beaked mask and wizard-like robes, is one of the images most popularly
associated with plague today. He’s often found in books and films 
about the 14th century pandemic known as the Black Death. The only problem is
that’s about as accurate as placing a modern surgeon at the court
of Louis the 14th in Versailles. The confusion is understandable though— the Black Death had several aftershocks, including a series of devastating
outbreaks in Western Europe during the 17th century. This is when the iconic plague doctor
actually emerged on the scene. First described in the early 17th century, the outfit consisted of a hood 
with crystal eyepieces and a beak filled with a pungent 
combination of herbs and compounds. This could include cinnamon, pepper,
turpentine, roast copper, and powdered viper flesh. This recipe was inspired by the famed
2nd century Greco-Roman physician Galen, and was thought to ward off poisoned air
known as miasma. People believed this bad air
spread plague after emanating from swamps and sources of decay, such as dead plants or animal carcasses. In earlier centuries, doctors across
Europe carried metal pomanders filled with similar mixtures, and it’s possible that the beak evolved
as a hands-free alternative. The rest of the costume, which included 
an oiled leather robe, boots and gloves, acted as kind of an early hazmat suit, likely designed to block miasma 
from entering through the skin’s pores. While this shows some basic understanding
that plague spread from one place to another, these doctors couldn’t know that,
in most cases, the true culprit was a tiny flea 
transmitting the bacteria, Yersinia pestis, 
from one person or animal to another. It’s possible that the plague doctor’s
outfit may have provided some unintentional protection 
from flea bites. However, not enough information
survives to know whether the costumed doctors fared any better than
their ordinarily robed counterparts. It's no surprise that this bizarre getup
has captured popular imagination, despite the fact that its use was limited
to a few places in Italy and France during the 17th and early 18th centuries. Even at the time, it was viewed
with macabre fascination and occasionally used to mock
the ineffective and corrupt practices of some physicians. Until the 20th century, there was 
no effective treatment for the plague, but that didn’t stop doctors— 
costumed or not— from trying. They consulted the works of earlier
physicians for guidance, did what they could to fend off miasma, and prescribed a variety 
of concoctions and antidotes. They also relied on pre-modern
medical mainstays. These could include bloodletting, which involved draining (sometimes 
concerningly large amounts of) blood in an attempt to remove poison 
or restore the body’s natural balance. Or cupping, where the rim 
of a heated glass was placed over swollen lymph nodes 
in hopes of making them burst sooner— a sign, when it occurred naturally,
that a plague patient was on the mend. Or— perhaps most painfully—
cautery, which involved lancing the lymph nodes

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the years before World War Two, a pair of brothers worked together
as shoemakers in the German town of Herzogenaurach. But during the war, the siblings
had a terrible argument— a fight so explosive it split
the family business in two. At first, the feud only infected 
their newly competing personnel. But over the coming years, this disagreement divided
all of Herzogenaurach. Residents became fiercely
loyal to one brand of shoe. Local businesses chose sides and 
marriage across lines was discouraged. Herzogenaurach eventually became 
known as “the town of bent necks” because its residents looked down 
to ensure they were interacting with members of their group. But could such a serious divide
really be about shoes? Doesn’t it take more significant 
cultural differences to produce this degree of conflict? To answer this question, we can turn 
to social psychologist Henri Tajfel and his collaborators 
at the University of Bristol. This team developed 
the minimal group paradigm, a methodology designed to investigate the minimal conditions required 
to turn people against each other. Their plan was to gather participants 
without the usual factors that lead to hostility, such as religious, ethnic, 
gender, or other cultural differences. Then, they would split into groups, and run them through scenarios
that added one variable at a time to see what stirred up conflict. But first, they needed
a control condition— a pair of groups without any group bias. The researchers told participants
they were being grouped based on their ability to estimate things
correctly or incorrectly; but in reality, 
the groups were totally random. Since the researchers ensured none
of the participants interacted, no one could form any judgments
or personal bonds. Then everyone was given resources
to distribute. Each participant was free to give
resources to members of either group, and importantly, everything was anonymous. So whatever a participant decided, it had no impact on how many resources
they personally would receive. With all the ingredients 
for discrimination removed and no reason for competition
over resources, the scientists assumed this would
make a conflict-free baseline for further research. But even in these groups, where membership was only defined 
by a perceived similarity in possessing an arbitrary skill, individuals still showed in-group bias. They consistently gave more to members
of their own group than the out-group. Later, research went even further, informing participants that the only thing
determining their group membership was a coin flip. But group bias still occurred. The minimal groups of “us” and “them”
were enough. So, in the absence of stereotypes, 
resource conflicts and status differences, what was left? What could possibly account for people 
showing clear preferences for the most temporary and meaningless
of groups? The answer that came to Tajfel 
and his colleagues was social identity. People regularly use group membership 
to help determine their sense of identity. And these minimal group experiments
suggested that simply being categorized as part of a group is enough to link 
that group to a person’s sense of self. Then, in an effort to create
a meaningful identity, participants allocated more resources
to their in-group than the out-group— pursuing their group's interests despite
no clear benefit to themselves as individuals. Variants of these experiments have 
been conducted around the globe, examining how a shared sense 
of “us” can affect our attention, perception, memory, and emotions. The mental processes
behind minimal group distinctions appear to be the same as many of those
that underlie real group identities. So it is possible that these seemingly
insignificant differences can harden into much more serious divides. That said, minimal groups don't
always drive people apart. Bringing individuals together 
in a new group can temporarily help people
overcome entrenched biases. However, these positive effects are easily
negated by external factors that reinforce existing group identities. Ultimately, the psychology of groups
is part of the human condition, and our tendency towards in-group bias
is an undeniable part of that. So it's up to all of us to make
our groups and ourselves as inclusive of others as possible.

**Transcript**:
In the years before World War Two, a pair of brothers worked together
as shoemakers in the German town of Herzogenaurach. But during the war, the siblings
had a terrible argument— a fight so explosive it split
the family business in two. At first, the feud only infected 
their newly competing personnel. But over the coming years, this disagreement divided
all of Herzogenaurach. Residents became fiercely
loyal to one brand of shoe. Local businesses chose sides and 
marriage across lines was discouraged. Herzogenaurach eventually became 
known as “the town of bent necks” because its residents looked down 
to ensure they were interacting with members of their group. But could such a serious divide
really be about shoes? Doesn’t it take more significant 
cultural differences to produce this degree of conflict? To answer this question, we can turn 
to social psychologist Henri Tajfel and his collaborators 
at the University of Bristol. This team developed 
the minimal group paradigm, a methodology designed to investigate the minimal conditions required 
to turn people against each other. Their plan was to gather participants 
without the usual factors that lead to hostility, such as religious, ethnic, 
gender, or other cultural differences. Then, they would split into groups, and run them through scenarios
that added one variable at a time to see what stirred up conflict. But first, they needed
a control condition— a pair of groups without any group bias. The researchers told participants
they were being grouped based on their ability to estimate things
correctly or incorrectly; but in reality, 
the groups were totally random. Since the researchers ensured none
of the participants interacted, no one could form any judgments
or personal bonds. Then everyone was given resources
to distribute. Each participant was free to give
resources to members of either group, and importantly, everything was anonymous. So whatever a participant decided, it had no impact on how many resources
they personally would receive. With all the ingredients 
for discrimination removed and no reason for competition
over resources, the scientists assumed this would
make a conflict-free baseline for further research. But even in these groups, where membership was only defined 
by a perceived similarity in possessing an arbitrary skill, individuals still showed in-group bias. They consistently gave more to members
of their own group than the out-group. Later, research went even further, informing participants that the only thing
determining their group membership was a coin flip. But group bias still occurred. The minimal groups of “us” and “them”
were enough. So, in the absence of stereotypes, 
resource conflicts and status differences, what was left? What could possibly account for people 
showing clear preferences for the most temporary and meaningless
of groups? The answer that came to Tajfel 
and his colleagues was social identity. People regularly use group membership 
to help determine their sense of identity. And these minimal group experiments
suggested that simply being categorized as part of a group is enough to link 
that group to a person’s sense of self. Then, in an effort to create
a meaningful identity, participants allocated more resources
to their in-group than the out-group— pursuing their group's interests despite
no clear benefit to themselves as individuals. Variants of these experiments have 
been conducted around the globe, examining how a shared sense 
of “us” can affect our attention, perception, memory, and emotions. The mental processes
behind minimal group distinctions appear to be the same as many of those
that underlie real group identities. So it is possible that these seemingly
insignificant differences can harden into much more serious divides. That said, minimal groups don't
always drive people apart. Bringing individuals together 
in a new group can temporarily help people
overcome entrenched biases. However, these positive effects are easily
negated by external factors that reinforce existing group identities. Ultimately, the psychology of groups
is part of the human condition, and our tendency towards in-group bias
is an undeniable part of that. So it's up to all of us to make
our groups and ourselves as inclusive of others as possible.

**Transcript**:
While most people wouldn’t consider
the crusty exterior of an oyster to be particularly beautiful, opening up this craggy case might reveal
an exquisite jewel nestled within. Yet, despite their iridescent colors
and smooth shapes, pearls are actually made 
of the exact same material as the shell that surrounds them. Pearls, urchin spines, the shells 
of mussels, snails and clams, even coral— all these structures are made 
out of the same chemical compound: calcium carbonate. So, how does this single ingredient form
such a vast array of materials? Calcium carbonate, or CaCO3, 
is common on land, and even more bountiful in the sea. The Earth’s crust is rich in calcium, and over millennia these deposits 
have seeped into rivers and oceans. This is especially true 
near hydrothermal vents, where hot seawater mingles 
with calcium rich basalts. Meanwhile, when carbon dioxide in the air
interacts with seawater it eventually produces
dissolved carbonate. Every year, the ocean absorbs roughly
one third of our carbon dioxide emissions, adding huge quantities of carbonate
into the water. It’s no surprise that sea creatures have
made use of these abundant compounds, but the way calcium and carbonate are
woven together into various shapes is surprisingly artful. Let’s return to the humble oyster. Like many aquatic mollusks,
oysters start life as exposed larvae, and quickly get to work building
a protective shell. First, an organ called the mantle secretes
an organic matrix of proteins and other molecules 
to construct a scaffold. Then, the oyster filters the seawater, drawing out calcium and carbonate to
combine them into its building material. It lays this material over the scaffold, which is covered in charged proteins
that attract and guide the calcium carbonate molecules
into layers. The specific arrangement of these protein
scaffolds depends on the mollusk species and their environment, accounting for their vast diversity 
of shell shapes, sizes, and colors. Mollusks carefully control all components 
of their calcium carbonate creations— even manipulating CaCO3 
at the molecular level. Using special proteins, mollusks can produce 
two crystal structures out of CaCO3: calcite and aragonite. Both of these compounds have 
the same chemical composition, but different qualities due to the way
their crystal lattices are arranged. Calcite is the more stable of the two 
and less prone to dissolving over time, so most mollusk shells have 
a sturdy outer layer of calcite. As the slightly more soluble molecule, aragonite can better adapt 
to more or less acidic environments. So most mollusk shells have 
an interior layer of aragonite to maintain their internal pH level. But one form of aragonite is stronger
and more versatile than the rest: nacre. Mollusks make this special material
by placing successive layers of aragonite interspersed with proteins. These layers are stacked
like hexagonal bricks, each surrounded by other organic material
that directs their orientation. The uniform layering and brick-like
structure of nacre is key to its signature iridescence. The layers are similar in thickness 
to the wavelength of visible light, so the light reflecting 
from its interior surface interferes with the light reflecting 
from the outer surface. When particles of light strike the nacre, they bounce around its multilayered 
crystalline structure in a cascade of shifting rainbows. But nacre isn’t just pretty— it’s one of the strongest and lightest
biomaterials we know of. And it's not just oysters that produce it. In fact, numerous mollusk
species deploy nacre as one of their primary
defense mechanisms. If an intruding parasite or even a stray
particle of sand irritates the mantle, the mollusk will coat the offender 
in nacre-producing cells to form what’s known as a pearl sac. These cells wrap the threat in layers 
of proteins and aragonite until eventually the cocoon 
completely absorbs the invader— dissolving the threat into an opalescent 
sphere of nacre. This defense mechanism is our leading
theory for mollusks making pearls; transforming everyday intruders
into timeless treasures.

**Transcript**:
The Black Death. The 1918 Flu Pandemic. COVID-19. We tend to think of these catastrophic, 
world-changing pandemics as very unlikely events. But between 1980 and 2020, at least three diseases emerged 
that caused global pandemics. COVID-19, yes, but also 
the 2009 swine flu and HIV/AIDS. Disease outbreaks are surprisingly common. Over the past four centuries, the longest stretch of time 
without a documented outbreak that killed at least 10,000 people
was just four years. As bad as these smaller outbreaks are, they’re far less deadly than
a COVID-19-level pandemic. In fact, many people born after 
the 1918 flu lived their entire lives without experiencing
a similar world-changing pandemic. What’s the probability that you do, too? There are several ways 
to answer this question. You could look at history. A team of scientists and engineers 
who took this approach catalogued all documented epidemics 
and pandemics between 1600 and 1950. They used that data to do two things. First, to graph the likelihood 
that an outbreak of any size pops up somewhere in the world 
over a set period of time. And second, to estimate the likelihood
that that outbreak would get large enough to kill a certain percentage
of the world's population. This graph shows that while huge
pandemics are unlikely, they're not that unlikely. The team used these two distributions
to estimate that the risk of a COVID-19-level pandemic 
is about 0.5% per year, and could be as high as 1.4% if new diseases emerge 
more frequently in the future. And we’ll come back to those numbers, but first, let’s look at another way
to estimate the likelihood of a future pandemic: modeling one from the ground up. For most pandemics to happen, a pathogen,
which is a microbe that can cause disease, has to spill over from its normal host by
making contact with and infecting a human. Then, the pathogen has to spread widely, crossing international boundaries
and infecting lots of people. Many variables determine whether a given
spillover event becomes a pandemic. For example, the type of pathogen, 
how often humans come into close contact with its animal reservoir, 
existing immunity, and so on. Viruses are prime candidates 
to cause the next big pandemic. Scientists estimate that there are about
1.7 million as-yet-undiscovered viruses that currently infect mammals and birds, and that roughly 40% of these have the
potential to spill over and infect humans. A team of scientists built a model
using this information, as well as data about the global
population, air travel networks, how people move around in communities,
country preparedness levels, and how people might respond to pandemics. The model generated hundreds of thousands
of virtual pandemics. The scientists then used 
this catalog to estimate that the probability of another 
COVID-19-level pandemic is 2.5 to 3.3% per year. To get a sense of how these risks
play out over a lifetime, let’s pick a value roughly in the middle
of all these estimates: 2%. Now let’s build what’s called 
a probability tree diagram to model all possible scenarios. The first branch of the tree
represents the first year: there’s a 2% probability of experiencing
a COVID-19-level pandemic, which means there’s a 98% probability 
of not experiencing one. Second branch, same thing, Third branch, same. And so on, 72 more times. There is only one path that results
in a fully pandemic-free lifetime: 98%, or 0.98,
multiplied by itself 75 times, which comes out to roughly 22%. So the likelihood of living through 
at least one more COVID 19-level-pandemic in the next 75 years 
is 100 minus 22%, or 78%. 78%! If we use the most optimistic
yearly estimate— 0.5%— the lifetime probability drops to 31%. If we use the most pessimistic one,
it jumps to 92%. Even 31% is too high to ignore; even if we get lucky, 
future generations might not. Also, pandemics are usually
random, independent events: so even if the yearly probability 
of a COVID-19-level pandemic is 1%, we could absolutely get another
one in ten years. The good news is we now have tools 
that make pandemics less destructive. Scientists estimated that early warning
systems, contact tracing, social distancing, 
and other public health measures saved over a million lives 
in just the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, not to mention the millions
of lives saved by vaccines. One day, another pandemic
will sweep the globe. But we can work to make that day
less likely to be tomorrow. We can reduce the risk
of spillover events, and we can contain spillovers
that do happen so they don’t become full-blown pandemics. Imagine how the future might
look if we interacted with the animal world more carefully, and if we had well-funded, open-access 
global disease monitoring programs, AI-powered contact tracing
and isolation measures, universal vaccines, 
next-generation antiviral drugs, and other tech we haven't even thought of. It’s in our power to change 
these probabilities. So, we have a choice: we could do nothing
and hope we get lucky. Or we could take the threat 
seriously enough that it becomes a self-defeating prophecy. Which future would you rather live in?

**Transcript**:
Smallpox is one of the deadliest
diseases in history, but fortunately, it’s been eradicated
for over 40 years. However, samples of the virus 
that causes smallpox still exist, leading to concern that rogue actors
might try to weaponize it. This is especially worrying because older smallpox vaccines
can have serious side effects, and modern antiviral drugs have never
been tested against this disease. To protect against this potential threat, the US government is funding research
to improve smallpox treatments and vaccines. And since it’s unethical to expose 
people to a highly lethal virus, labs are using humanity's closest
biological relatives as research subjects. But is it right to harm these animals to
protect humanity from a potential threat? Or should our closest relatives also be
protected against lethal experiments? What would you do as a scientist faced
with this very real scenario? In many ways, this dilemma isn't new. Animals have been used in research aimed
at improving human welfare for centuries, typically at the cost of their lives. This practice reflects the widespread
belief that human lives are more valuable than non-human lives. People have different views about 
the ethics of animal testing and how it’s conducted. But whatever your opinion, this scenario raises an important
philosophical question: how do we determine the value of a life,
whether human or non-human? One tool philosophers have used 
to consider this question is moral status. Beings with moral status
should have their needs and interests taken into consideration by those 
making decisions that impact them. Traditionally, moral status
has been seen as binary— either a being’s interests matter 
for their own sake, or they don’t. And historically, many philosophers
believed that humans had moral status and other animals didn’t. Some contemporary philosophers
like Shelly Kagan have argued that moral status
comes in degrees, but even in this model, he argues 
that people have the most moral status. However, determining what grants any
degree of moral status can be difficult. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant
thought humans have moral status because of their rational nature 
and ability to will their actions. A binary conception of moral status then
suggests that beings with these capacities are “persons” bearing full moral status, while all other creatures are “things”
without moral status. But thinkers like Christine Korsgaard 
have argued a Kantian view should include many non-human animals 
because of how they value their own good. Another line of argument, suggested 
by utilitarianism’s founding father Jeremy Bentham and elaborated
by Peter Singer, claims that a capacity for suffering makes an entity worthy 
of moral consideration. These inclusive ways of thinking about
moral status dramatically widen the scope of our moral responsibility, in ways some people might find unnerving. So where do our monkeys stand? Our closest genetic relatives have
high social and intellectual capacities. They live cooperatively 
in complex social groups and recognize members 
of their community as individuals. They support and learn from one another— there’s even evidence 
they respond to inequality. And of course,
they’re capable of suffering. Yet despite all this, 
it’s still generally common opinion that a human’s life is more valuable
than a monkey’s. And that while killing one human 
to save five others is typically wrong, killing one monkey to save five humans 
is regrettable, but morally acceptable. Even morally required. At some point, however, 
this calculation starts to feel unstable. Should we kill 100 monkeys 
to save five people? How about 10,000? If moral status is binary and monkeys
don't have it, then theoretically, any number of monkeys could be sacrificed
to save just one person. But if moral status comes in degrees
and monkeys have any at all, then at some point the balance will tip. The situation you're in complicates
things even further. Unlike the scenarios above, there's no guarantee your work
will ever save human lives. This is true of any animal experiment— the process of scientific discovery only
sometimes leads to improved medical care. But in your case,
it’s even trickier! While the government is worried smallpox
might be weaponized, if they’re wrong
the disease will remain eradicated, and your research won’t save
anyone from smallpox. You could try to quantify this uncertainty
to help make your decision. But how do you determine what 
an acceptable amount of risk is? And what if there’s so much uncertainty
that your calculations are essentially wild guesses? These kinds of moral mathematics
get complicated fast, and some philosophers would
argue they’re not even the best way to make moral decisions. But whatever you decide, 
your choice should be well justified.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Smallpox is one of the deadliest
diseases in history, but fortunately, it’s been eradicated
for over 40 years. However, samples of the virus 
that causes smallpox still exist, leading to concern that rogue actors
might try to weaponize it. This is especially worrying because older smallpox vaccines
can have serious side effects, and modern antiviral drugs have never
been tested against this disease. To protect against this potential threat, the US government is funding research
to improve smallpox treatments and vaccines. And since it’s unethical to expose 
people to a highly lethal virus, labs are using humanity's closest
biological relatives as research subjects. But is it right to harm these animals to
protect humanity from a potential threat? Or should our closest relatives also be
protected against lethal experiments? What would you do as a scientist faced
with this very real scenario? In many ways, this dilemma isn't new. Animals have been used in research aimed
at improving human welfare for centuries, typically at the cost of their lives. This practice reflects the widespread
belief that human lives are more valuable than non-human lives. People have different views about 
the ethics of animal testing and how it’s conducted. But whatever your opinion, this scenario raises an important
philosophical question: how do we determine the value of a life,
whether human or non-human? One tool philosophers have used 
to consider this question is moral status. Beings with moral status
should have their needs and interests taken into consideration by those 
making decisions that impact them. Traditionally, moral status
has been seen as binary— either a being’s interests matter 
for their own sake, or they don’t. And historically, many philosophers
believed that humans had moral status and other animals didn’t. Some contemporary philosophers
like Shelly Kagan have argued that moral status
comes in degrees, but even in this model, he argues 
that people have the most moral status. However, determining what grants any
degree of moral status can be difficult. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant
thought humans have moral status because of their rational nature 
and ability to will their actions. A binary conception of moral status then
suggests that beings with these capacities are “persons” bearing full moral status, while all other creatures are “things”
without moral status. But thinkers like Christine Korsgaard 
have argued a Kantian view should include many non-human animals 
because of how they value their own good. Another line of argument, suggested 
by utilitarianism’s founding father Jeremy Bentham and elaborated
by Peter Singer, claims that a capacity for suffering makes an entity worthy 
of moral consideration. These inclusive ways of thinking about
moral status dramatically widen the scope of our moral responsibility, in ways some people might find unnerving. So where do our monkeys stand? Our closest genetic relatives have
high social and intellectual capacities. They live cooperatively 
in complex social groups and recognize members 
of their community as individuals. They support and learn from one another— there’s even evidence 
they respond to inequality. And of course,
they’re capable of suffering. Yet despite all this, 
it’s still generally common opinion that a human’s life is more valuable
than a monkey’s. And that while killing one human 
to save five others is typically wrong, killing one monkey to save five humans 
is regrettable, but morally acceptable. Even morally required. At some point, however, 
this calculation starts to feel unstable. Should we kill 100 monkeys 
to save five people? How about 10,000? If moral status is binary and monkeys
don't have it, then theoretically, any number of monkeys could be sacrificed
to save just one person. But if moral status comes in degrees
and monkeys have any at all, then at some point the balance will tip. The situation you're in complicates
things even further. Unlike the scenarios above, there's no guarantee your work
will ever save human lives. This is true of any animal experiment— the process of scientific discovery only
sometimes leads to improved medical care. But in your case,
it’s even trickier! While the government is worried smallpox
might be weaponized, if they’re wrong
the disease will remain eradicated, and your research won’t save
anyone from smallpox. You could try to quantify this uncertainty
to help make your decision. But how do you determine what 
an acceptable amount of risk is? And what if there’s so much uncertainty
that your calculations are essentially wild guesses? These kinds of moral mathematics
get complicated fast, and some philosophers would
argue they’re not even the best way to make moral decisions. But whatever you decide, 
your choice should be well justified.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
- A blood moon lunar eclipse
wasn't always something to look forward to. When the moon turned red thousands of years ago, the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians feared
that something monstrous and evil was eating the moon. They would shout at the night sky to try and fend off the ravenous beasts and since the average lunar eclipse lasts around 100 minutes, and the moon returns to normal afterward, they
were probably convinced that their whooping and
howling actually worked. We know now that the moon
doesn't need our protection, but why does it turn
red in the first place? (peaceful music) Whenever you look up at a full moon, you're seeing sunlight that's reflected off the lunar surface, so if something were
to block that sunlight say, the earth, then in theory, the moon should disappear from view but during a total lunar eclipse when the moon passes
through the earth's shadow, we get a red moon, not a vanishing one. So what's going on? To figure it out, let's take a quick trip to the lunar surface. This is a NASA simulation
of what the earth looks like during a total lunar eclipse. Notice the red ring around our planet. Everywhere you see that
ring is either a sunrise or a sunset, and while
it's true that no direct sunlight is reaching the lunar surface at this moment, earth's
atmosphere is bending the red wavelengths of
light around the planet, so that redness you see
during a blood moon eclipse is a combination of
light from every sunrise and sunset on earth,
all happening at once. So the moon appears
red for the same reason that sunrises and sunsets on earth are red because of a phenomenon
called Rayleigh Scattering. Named after the British
physicist, John William Strutt, also known as Lord
Rayleigh, who discovered it in the late 19th century. It describes how different
colors of sunlight interact with the earth's atmosphere. Look at the sky during
daytime, for example. It appears blue because air molecules in earth's atmosphere scatter
blue light more easily than red, but during sunrise and sunset, the light travels through
more of earth's atmosphere before reaching your eye
which has two consequences. First, it means more overall
sunlight is scattered, making the sun appear dimmer. That's why you can easily
gaze upon the sun at sunset compared to at high noon. And secondly, more scattering
means more blue light is scattered away, leaving the
redder wavelengths behind. Similarly, the ring around earth during a total lunar eclipse is red because the sunlight travels
through a long stretch of earth's atmosphere, from one end of the planet to the other. So rather than fear a blood
moon like the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians, why not think
of it as a romantic moment? After all, it's the only time
when you can see the sunrise and sunset simultaneously. (peaceful music)

**Transcript**:
This round structure is only about 
ten billionths of a meter in diameter, but it— as well as other technologies
in the pipeline— could be stepping stones to a monumental
public health ambition: a single vaccine that protects you 
against everything. We’ll get back to the grand vision later,
but first, let’s start with something that’s
being developed now: a vaccine that would protect you 
against every strain of the flu— even ones that don’t exist yet. Here’s one flu virus particle. On the inside is the virus’ RNA, and on the outside are lots and lots
of hemagglutinin proteins. Hemagglutinin attaches to a receptor
on a human cell and fuses the viral and human membranes, 
starting the infection. Hemagglutinin is also one of the things
your immune system recognizes and reacts to the most. To understand how this works, think of hemagglutinin as a bust of 19th
century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Croissant! If you show Napoleon to an immune system
and say, “remember him,” the immune system will mostly
focus on his head. And the same is true 
for the real hemagglutinin. One way the immune system 
remembers things is by physically interacting with them. Think of it as making plaster molds
of parts of the head: we call these molds antibodies. The antibodies float around your
bloodstream for a while and then can diminish, but blueprints on how to make them 
are stored in specialized memory cells, waiting for future Napoleons to invade. Here’s the thing, though. Hemagglutinin is constantly mutating. Most mutations are subtle, produced by single letter changes 
in the virus’ RNA: like this or this. Over time, Napoleon-slash-hemagglutinin’s
head can change enough that our antibodies become less good
at recognizing it. This is called antigenic drift. Influenza is constantly drifting; that’s one reason you have to get
a new flu shot every year. But sometimes bigger changes happen. An animal, usually a pig, can
get infected with, say, a human flu and a bird flu. And those different viruses might
infect the same cell. If that happens, the two different viral
genomes can recombine in tens or even hundreds of ways. The human flu virus could 
pick up a bird flu hemagglutinin that’s never infected humans before. This is called antigenic shift, and if you get infected 
by this version of influenza, none of the antibodies against Napoleon's
head are going to help you. Antigenically shifted viruses
have the potential to infect many people very quickly, causing epidemics and sometimes pandemics. A truly universal flu vaccine would be
able to protect against current flu strains 
and future drifted or shifted strains. But how do we design a vaccine 
against a strain that doesn’t exist yet? We look to the past. There are key parts of hemagglutinin
that haven’t changed much over time and are probably critical
to infect human cells; these “conserved regions” could be 
promising targets for universal vaccines. But there's a problem that's hindered
classical vaccine production. Many conserved regions are in the neck, and it’s tough to get the immune system
to react to the neck. Also, because influenza-like viruses have
been around for hundreds of millions of years, there may not be a single region 
that’s common across all species and subtypes of influenza. But there’s promising science
in development. Remember this? This is a protein called ferritin; Its normal purpose is 
to store and move iron. But it’s also the rough size and shape
of a small virus. And if you attach viral proteins to it,
like this, you’d have something that looks,
to an immune system, like a virus— but would be completely harmless
and very engineerable. Recently, scientists engineered 
a ferritin nanoparticle to present 8 identical copies 
of the neck region of an H1 flu virus. They vaccinated mice 
with the nanoparticle, then injected them with a lethal dose 
of a completely different subtype, H5N1. All the vaccinated mice lived; 
all the unvaccinated ones died. Going one step beyond that, there may be conserved regions 
that we could take advantage of across different-but-related 
virus species— like SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and a few coronaviruses 
which cause some common colds. Over the past few decades, a different part of the immune system
has come into clearer focus. Instead of antibodies, 
this part of the immune system uses a vast array of T cells that kill,
for example, cells that have been infected by a virus. Vaccines that train this part
of the immune system, in addition to the antibody response,
could provide broader protection. A universal flu vaccine would be a
monumental achievement in public health. A fully universal vaccine against all
infectious disease is— for the moment— squarely in the realm of science fiction, partially because we have no idea 
how our immune system would react if we tried to train it against hundreds 
of different diseases at the same time. Probably not well. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Look at where medicine is today compared
to where it was two centuries ago. Who knows what it’ll look like
in another 50 or 100 years— maybe some future groundbreaking
technology will bring truly universal vaccines
within our grasp.

**Transcript**:
This round structure is only about 
ten billionths of a meter in diameter, but it— as well as other technologies
in the pipeline— could be stepping stones to a monumental
public health ambition: a single vaccine that protects you 
against everything. We’ll get back to the grand vision later,
but first, let’s start with something that’s
being developed now: a vaccine that would protect you 
against every strain of the flu— even ones that don’t exist yet. Here’s one flu virus particle. On the inside is the virus’ RNA, and on the outside are lots and lots
of hemagglutinin proteins. Hemagglutinin attaches to a receptor
on a human cell and fuses the viral and human membranes, 
starting the infection. Hemagglutinin is also one of the things
your immune system recognizes and reacts to the most. To understand how this works, think of hemagglutinin as a bust of 19th
century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Croissant! If you show Napoleon to an immune system
and say, “remember him,” the immune system will mostly
focus on his head. And the same is true 
for the real hemagglutinin. One way the immune system 
remembers things is by physically interacting with them. Think of it as making plaster molds
of parts of the head: we call these molds antibodies. The antibodies float around your
bloodstream for a while and then can diminish, but blueprints on how to make them 
are stored in specialized memory cells, waiting for future Napoleons to invade. Here’s the thing, though. Hemagglutinin is constantly mutating. Most mutations are subtle, produced by single letter changes 
in the virus’ RNA: like this or this. Over time, Napoleon-slash-hemagglutinin’s
head can change enough that our antibodies become less good
at recognizing it. This is called antigenic drift. Influenza is constantly drifting; that’s one reason you have to get
a new flu shot every year. But sometimes bigger changes happen. An animal, usually a pig, can
get infected with, say, a human flu and a bird flu. And those different viruses might
infect the same cell. If that happens, the two different viral
genomes can recombine in tens or even hundreds of ways. The human flu virus could 
pick up a bird flu hemagglutinin that’s never infected humans before. This is called antigenic shift, and if you get infected 
by this version of influenza, none of the antibodies against Napoleon's
head are going to help you. Antigenically shifted viruses
have the potential to infect many people very quickly, causing epidemics and sometimes pandemics. A truly universal flu vaccine would be
able to protect against current flu strains 
and future drifted or shifted strains. But how do we design a vaccine 
against a strain that doesn’t exist yet? We look to the past. There are key parts of hemagglutinin
that haven’t changed much over time and are probably critical
to infect human cells; these “conserved regions” could be 
promising targets for universal vaccines. But there's a problem that's hindered
classical vaccine production. Many conserved regions are in the neck, and it’s tough to get the immune system
to react to the neck. Also, because influenza-like viruses have
been around for hundreds of millions of years, there may not be a single region 
that’s common across all species and subtypes of influenza. But there’s promising science
in development. Remember this? This is a protein called ferritin; Its normal purpose is 
to store and move iron. But it’s also the rough size and shape
of a small virus. And if you attach viral proteins to it,
like this, you’d have something that looks,
to an immune system, like a virus— but would be completely harmless
and very engineerable. Recently, scientists engineered 
a ferritin nanoparticle to present 8 identical copies 
of the neck region of an H1 flu virus. They vaccinated mice 
with the nanoparticle, then injected them with a lethal dose 
of a completely different subtype, H5N1. All the vaccinated mice lived; 
all the unvaccinated ones died. Going one step beyond that, there may be conserved regions 
that we could take advantage of across different-but-related 
virus species— like SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and a few coronaviruses 
which cause some common colds. Over the past few decades, a different part of the immune system
has come into clearer focus. Instead of antibodies, 
this part of the immune system uses a vast array of T cells that kill,
for example, cells that have been infected by a virus. Vaccines that train this part
of the immune system, in addition to the antibody response,
could provide broader protection. A universal flu vaccine would be a
monumental achievement in public health. A fully universal vaccine against all
infectious disease is— for the moment— squarely in the realm of science fiction, partially because we have no idea 
how our immune system would react if we tried to train it against hundreds 
of different diseases at the same time. Probably not well. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Look at where medicine is today compared
to where it was two centuries ago. Who knows what it’ll look like
in another 50 or 100 years— maybe some future groundbreaking
technology will bring truly universal vaccines
within our grasp.

**Transcript**:
Each one of these machines represents
the economic system of a country. Every machine has three inputs: labor, people’s work. Capital, all the stuff 
that a business might use, including intangibles, like ideas. And natural resources. The machine converts these inputs
into goods and services, and because we’re willing to pay 
for the things the machine produces, what the machine is really creating here
is value. Economies turn inputs into value. What determines whether the machine
is capitalist, communist, socialist, or something else? Three dials. The first dial controls 
who owns the capital. Over here, the government owns 
every bit of capital, down to the last office paperclip. North Korea is probably 
the closest economy to 0%. On the other end of the spectrum, at 100%,
private citizens own all the capital. The US is about here, 
at roughly two-thirds private ownership. The second dial dictates how much control 
the government has over what gets produced. In economies with high coordination, 
like the old USSR, the government dictated what the economy
could— and would— produce. In economies with low coordination, the government might mandate a few things, but leaves most decision-making
up to the private sector. The third dial controls how extensively
markets are used to set prices. Over here at 0%, we have economies
with no markets, where the government sets all prices,
and consumers have no say. Over here at 100%, markets are used to set 
the price of everything, even things like basic 
life-saving health care. You can also think of this dial
as controlling the number and extent of government regulations— from tariffs on foreign goods 
to antitrust laws to regulations on net neutrality. So, capitalism isn’t just
one type of economy— it’s a wide range of possible economies, which makes answering the question of
whether capitalism is broken, complicated. But we’re going to try. At the height 
of the Industrial Revolution, the dials were set pretty close 
to what we now call free market, or “laissez-faire” capitalism. There were very few regulations, and economists of the time believed
that capitalism’s “invisible hand”— basically, individuals acting freely
and in their own self-interest— would produce optimal outcomes,
both for the economy and for society. And that’s how we ended 
up with embalming fluid in milk. In the late 1800s in the United States, 
food manufacturers put all kinds of cheap (and sometimes dangerous) adulterants
in food to maximize profits. What they were doing was legal,
but of course, wrong. There was a public outcry, 
and in 1906, Congress passed 
the Pure Food and Drugs Act, setting the stage 
for the Food and Drug Administration, which watches over the US’s
food supply to this day. These days, no economy really practices
pure “invisible hand” capitalism, but some people are increasingly worried
that today’s threats, like climate change and rising inequality,
can’t be solved by any capitalist system. Let’s look at climate change first. Capitalist economies incentivize growth. That’s created massive demand 
for the cheapest energy possible, which, for a long time, was fossil fuels. Burning all those fossil fuels
unquestionably drove— and continues to drive— climate change. Not only that, but the desire to maximize
profit usually gives corporations a powerful incentive to ignore
inconvenient truths. Just like tobacco companies denied 
the link between cigarettes and cancer, oil and gas companies denied 
or downplayed climate science for decades. Next, inequality. Inequality is complicated enough that
we made a whole video about it, but the simple story is: in many countries, inequality is rising. In the US, the UK, Canada, Ireland, 
and Australia, the top 1% of income earners have been
eating up a larger and larger share of total income over the past 50 years. In the UK, the top 1% share doubled
from 7% in 1980 to 14% in 2014. But that's not the whole picture. In England, the country for which we have
the best data before capitalism, the share of income going
to the top 5% of income earners peaked at around 40% in 1801, and then, as capitalism took hold, it fell
steadily to a low of about 17% in 1977. These days, it’s back up— 
hovering around 26%. And here’s another data point: 
in many European countries and Japan, the top 1%’s share of income came
down from 20 to 25% in the early 1900s to 7 to 12% today. So, is capitalism increasing inequality
or not? It depends. Remember, there's a wide range of settings
that all fall under capitalism, meaning that one country's version can
look very different from another's. It’s totally possible that inequality
could be increasing in China’s version of capitalism, 
while it decreases in France’s. Capitalism, it seems, 
is a double-edged sword. On the one hand,
it generates a huge amount of value, which translates to almost everyone having
more money than they otherwise would. On the other hand, it also funnels
the biggest chunk of that money into the wallets of relatively few people. Capitalism’s staunchest defenders say 
that with enough grit and determination, anyone can join the ranks of the wealthy. Is that really true? In a free, capitalist market, the wealth generated by successful
companies mostly flows to the owners. And along with that come 
other benefits: education, health, social standing,
and power. If owners tinker with the machine so that
it benefits them more than others, they create a feedback loop where power
and everything that flows with it calcifies within their families. And then you’ve got, basically, 
an aristocracy. So let’s break down the question
we started with: is pure, “invisible hand” capitalism, with all the dials set to the extremes,
broken? Yeah. But it’s also kind of irrelevant,
since no country uses pure capitalism. Is contemporary capitalism— as it’s practiced in much 
of the world today— broken? Well, it’s the major driver
of climate change and in many places is contributing
to rising inequality. And it may even be creating a de facto
aristocracy in certain countries, so, not looking good. The critical question is: 
can we fix contemporary capitalism by fiddling with the dials
or restricting who can turn them, or do we need to tear the machine down
and build a new one from scratch?

**Transcript**:
Each one of these machines represents
the economic system of a country. Every machine has three inputs: labor, people’s work. Capital, all the stuff 
that a business might use, including intangibles, like ideas. And natural resources. The machine converts these inputs
into goods and services, and because we’re willing to pay 
for the things the machine produces, what the machine is really creating here
is value. Economies turn inputs into value. What determines whether the machine
is capitalist, communist, socialist, or something else? Three dials. The first dial controls 
who owns the capital. Over here, the government owns 
every bit of capital, down to the last office paperclip. North Korea is probably 
the closest economy to 0%. On the other end of the spectrum, at 100%,
private citizens own all the capital. The US is about here, 
at roughly two-thirds private ownership. The second dial dictates how much control 
the government has over what gets produced. In economies with high coordination, 
like the old USSR, the government dictated what the economy
could— and would— produce. In economies with low coordination, the government might mandate a few things, but leaves most decision-making
up to the private sector. The third dial controls how extensively
markets are used to set prices. Over here at 0%, we have economies
with no markets, where the government sets all prices,
and consumers have no say. Over here at 100%, markets are used to set 
the price of everything, even things like basic

**Transcript**:
Mumbling fantastical gibberish;
devouring blocks of cheese in the nude; peeing in places that aren’t toilets;
and jumping out of windows. These are all things people have
reportedly done while sleepwalking, a behavior that’s mostly benign 
but can be dangerous in rare cases. It's estimated that around 18% of people
sleepwalk at least once in their lives. So, what exactly is sleepwalking? First, we have to understand just how
many of our daily activities do not require our active attention. Your prefrontal cortex is
your brain's conscious, deliberate, decision-making control hub. You might decide to get up and walk
using your prefrontal cortex, but the intricate coordination
of sensory inputs and muscles that follows does 
not require any attention. Instead, it’s mostly executed 
by a network of specialized nerve cells along the lower part of the brain 
and spinal cord, sometimes called
“central pattern generators.” These areas govern automatic movements
and basic actions related to survival. People with a REM sleep behavior disorder
may enact their dreams while they’re in REM sleep, usually keeping their eyes closed. However, this is a separate condition. Sleepwalking arises from a very different
stage of sleep— the deepest stage of non-REM sleep,
which is called “slow-wave sleep.” In this state, the cortex, 
including the prefrontal cortex, is essentially turned off. When someone is roused from this stage, they’ll usually appear groggy 
before either dozing off again or becoming fully conscious. For that moment, though, 
they’re in an intermediate state straddling sleep and wakefulness. A sleepwalking episode is, essentially,
an extreme, prolonged version of this. When sleepwalking, 
the prefrontal cortex remains inactive, so the person doesn’t possess executive,
deliberate control over their actions. But other parts of their brain are active. And, as we know, 
the body is capable of a lot without involving the prefrontal cortex. Sleepwalkers
avoid obstacles, walk, and speak— though it's often nonsense. Most sleepwalkers can do basic things, operating in a peaceful, unemotional, 
dreamless state. In rare cases, sleepwalkers perform more 
complex tasks like cooking and driving. They're occasionally guided
by physical urges, like eating or pursuing sexual activities. And some episodes involve the brain’s
fight or flight system, during which the person might suddenly 
perceive an imminent danger, and vocalize, cry, or even jolt out of bed
and run away. These episodes, 
called “sleep terrors,” are more common in young children
and usually result naturally. Indeed, sleepwalking is generally
more common in children, perhaps because the brain areas 
that control the transition between sleep and wakefulness
are still developing. But the exact mechanisms that cause
sleepwalking remain unclear. Many cases appear to run in families,
while others are more mysterious. Anything that could lead 
to partial awakening is thought to increase the likelihood. This includes factors that promote
deeper slow-wave sleep— like sedatives, hot sleep environments,
and operating on too little sleep— or things that disrupt sleep— 
like stress and other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea 
and restless leg syndrome. Doctors will usually evaluate 
these factors and promote habits that aid in healthy sleep, 
such as exercise, stress management, and a consistent and sufficient 
sleep schedule. They’ll also often recommend 
safety measures, like hiding dangerous items, installing 
door alarms and securing windows. If this doesn't help, they'll consider
certain medications. But many of the available treatments
for sleepwalking haven’t yet been rigorously studied, so how they work and how effective
they are is not entirely clear. So, what should you do 
if you encounter a sleepwalker? A common misconception is that rousing
a sleepwalker causes irreparable harm. Fortunately, this is not true. However, trying to forcefully wake them
can cause confusion and distress. The best practice seems to be 
to gently guide them back to bed; and, if they resist, to simply ensure
they’re safe until the episode resolves.

**Transcript**:
Mumbling fantastical gibberish;
devouring blocks of cheese in the nude; peeing in places that aren’t toilets;
and jumping out of windows. These are all things people have
reportedly done while sleepwalking, a behavior that’s mostly benign 
but can be dangerous in rare cases. It's estimated that around 18% of people
sleepwalk at least once in their lives. So, what exactly is sleepwalking? First, we have to understand just how
many of our daily activities do not require our active attention. Your prefrontal cortex is
your brain's conscious, deliberate, decision-making control hub. You might decide to get up and walk
using your prefrontal cortex, but the intricate coordination
of sensory inputs and muscles that follows does 
not require any attention. Instead, it’s mostly executed 
by a network of specialized nerve cells along the lower part of the brain 
and spinal cord, sometimes called
“central pattern generators.” These areas govern automatic movements
and basic actions related to survival. People with a REM sleep behavior disorder
may enact their dreams while they’re in REM sleep, usually keeping their eyes closed. However, this is a separate condition. Sleepwalking arises from a very different
stage of sleep— the deepest stage of non-REM sleep,
which is called “slow-wave sleep.” In this state, the cortex, 
including the prefrontal cortex, is essentially turned off. When someone is roused from this stage, they’ll usually appear groggy 
before either dozing off again or becoming fully conscious. For that moment, though, 
they’re in an intermediate state straddling sleep and wakefulness. A sleepwalking episode is, essentially,
an extreme, prolonged version of this. When sleepwalking, 
the prefrontal cortex remains inactive, so the person doesn’t possess executive,
deliberate control over their actions. But other parts of their brain are active. And, as we know, 
the body is capable of a lot without involving the prefrontal cortex. Sleepwalkers
avoid obstacles, walk, and speak— though it's often nonsense. Most sleepwalkers can do basic things, operating in a peaceful, unemotional, 
dreamless state. In rare cases, sleepwalkers perform more 
complex tasks like cooking and driving. They're occasionally guided
by physical urges, like eating or pursuing sexual activities. And some episodes involve the brain’s
fight or flight system, during which the person might suddenly 
perceive an imminent danger, and vocalize, cry, or even jolt out of bed
and run away. These episodes, 
called “sleep terrors,” are more common in young children
and usually result naturally. Indeed, sleepwalking is generally

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2000, a company called ViroPharma
ran clinical trials of pleconaril, a new pill designed to treat 
the common cold. In many patients, the pill helped. But in 7 of them, 
just a few days into the treatment, researchers found mutated virus variants
that were almost completely resistant to pleconaril. Viruses are always mutating, but this one
mutated so quickly that it managed to outmaneuver years of research 
and development in just a few days. If you didn't have an immune
system and caught a cold, the infection would quickly spread
deep into your lungs. Rampant viral replication would destroy
tissue there, until your lungs couldn’t supply your body
with enough oxygen and you’d asphyxiate. Unfortunately, for millions of people
around the world who live with a less-than-fully-functional
immune system or who are on immunosuppressant drugs, this is a real risk: “minor” infections can turn serious
or even deadly. But if you're fortunate enough to have
a fully functional immune system, a cold will probably give you 
a few relatively mild symptoms. On average, adults catch more than
150 colds throughout their lives. And despite the fact 
that the symptoms are similar, the cause could be different each time. Common colds are caused by at least
8 different families of virus, each of which can have 
its own species and subtypes. How can so many different viruses
cause the same illness? Well, viruses can only invade
our bodies in a few ways: one is to come in on a breath. We have to breathe, so our immune system 
sets up a bunch of frontline defenses and these are actually what produce
many of the symptoms of a cold. Your mucus-y, dripping nose is your immune
system trapping and flushing out virus. Your fever is your immune system 
raising your body temperature to slow down viral replication. And your inflamed, well, everything, that’s your immune system
widening your blood vessels and recruiting its white blood cell army
to help kill the virus. So, if the common cold is caused
by many different viruses, is a cure even possible? Here’s one fact in our favor: a single family of viruses causes 
30 to 50% of all colds: rhinovirus. If we could eliminate all
rhinovirus infections, we’d be a long way towards curing
the common cold. There are two main ways to fight a virus:
vaccines and antiviral drugs. The first attempt to create a rhinovirus
vaccine was a success— but a short-lived one. In 1957, William Price vaccinated 50 kids 
with inactivated rhinovirus and gave 50 others a placebo. Soon afterwards, a rhinovirus outbreak 
spread throughout the kids. In the vaccinated group, only 3 got sick. In the placebo group, 23 did— 
almost 8 times as many. And despite the small numbers, 
this was promising: the immune systems of vaccinated kids 
were successfully recognizing and responding to rhinovirus. But later trials of the vaccine showed
no protection at all— none. This wasn’t Price’s fault— no one at the time knew that rhinovirus
had multiple subtypes. Price’s vaccine, 
for reasons we don’t fully understand, didn't provide broad protection, meaning it was only effective against one
or maybe a few subtypes of rhinovirus— out of 169 subtypes and counting. Sometimes, when we make a vaccine, 
we get lucky. The mRNA COVID vaccines, for example, effectively protect us against severe
disease and death across the original virus 
and variants too. But we have yet to create a broadly
protective vaccine against rhinovirus, or any other virus that causes
the common cold. Okay, what about antiviral drugs? Viruses hijack human cellular machinery
to replicate and spread, so it’s hard to make a molecule
that’s toxic to the virus without also being toxic to the human. And even if you manage to do that, the virus could mutate 
out of reach of the drug. Viruses are slippery beasts. We have, though, had some
incredible successes: we eradicated smallpox thanks
to an effective vaccine, the fact that it can’t hide
out in other species, and its relatively low mutation rate. HIV, on the other hand, mutates so quickly
that in an untreated individual, every possible single-letter mutation
in the virus’s genetic code could, in theory,
be produced in a single day. Despite trying for decades, 
we still don’t have a vaccine. But we do have an effective
cocktail of HIV drugs that the virus can’t easily mutate 
away from. Unfortunately, 
we are stuck with colds for now. But the last few decades have featured
some entirely game-changing medical breakthroughs,
like mRNA vaccines and CRISPR. CRISPR could be particularly promising
as an antiviral agent, because it originally evolved in bacteria
as an immune defense against viruses. In fact, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a research team showed that 
a CRISPR system could degrade coronavirus and influenza genomes
in our lung cells. They called their system prophylactic
antiviral CRISPR in human cells. Or, for short, PAC-MAN.

spread throughout the kids. In the vaccinated group, only 3 got sick. In the placebo group, 23 did— 
almost 8 times as many. And despite the small numbers, 
this was promising: the immune systems of vaccinated kids 
were successfully recognizing and responding to rhinovirus. But later trials of the vaccine showed
no protection at all— none. This wasn’t Price’s fault— no one at the time knew that rhinovirus
had multiple subtypes. Price’s vaccine, 
for reasons we don’t fully understand, didn't provide broad protection, meaning it was only effective against one
or maybe a few subtypes of rhinovirus— out of 169 subtypes and counting. Sometimes, when we make a vaccine, 
we get lucky. The mRNA COVID vaccines, for example, effectively protect us against severe
disease and death across the original virus 
and variants too. But we have yet to create a broadly
protective vaccine against rhinovirus, or any other virus that causes
the common cold. Okay, what about antiviral drugs? Viruses hijack human cellular machinery
to replicate and spread, so it’s hard to make a molecule
that’s toxic to the virus without also being toxic to the human. And even if you manage to do that, the virus could mutate 
out of reach of the drug. Viruses are slippery beasts. We have, though, had some
incredible successes: we eradicated smallpox thanks
to an effective vaccine, the fact that it can’t hide
out in other species, and its relatively low mutation rate. HIV, on the other hand, mutates so quickly
that in an untreated individual, every possible single-letter mutation
in the virus’s genetic code could, in theory,
be produced in a single day. Despite trying for decades, 
we still don’t have a vaccine. But we do have an effective
cocktail of HIV drugs that the virus can’t easily mutate 
away from. Unfortunately, 
we are stuck with colds for now. But the last few decades have featured
some entirely game-changing medical breakthroughs,
like mRNA vaccines and CRISPR. CRISPR could be particularly promising
as an antiviral agent, because it originally evolved in bacteria
as an immune defense against viruses. In fact, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a research team showed that 
a CRISPR system could degrade coronavirus and influenza genomes

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2000, a company called ViroPharma
ran clinical trials of pleconaril, a new pill designed to treat 
the common cold. In many patients, the pill helped. But in 7 of them, 
just a few days into the treatment, researchers found mutated virus variants
that were almost completely resistant to pleconaril. Viruses are always mutating, but this one
mutated so quickly that it managed to outmaneuver years of research 
and development in just a few days. If you didn't have an immune
system and caught a cold, the infection would quickly spread
deep into your lungs. Rampant viral replication would destroy
tissue there, until your lungs couldn’t supply your body
with enough oxygen and you’d asphyxiate. Unfortunately, for millions of people
around the world who live with a less-than-fully-functional
immune system or who are on immunosuppressant drugs, this is a real risk: “minor” infections can turn serious
or even deadly. But if you're fortunate enough to have
a fully functional immune system, a cold will probably give you 
a few relatively mild symptoms. On average, adults catch more than
150 colds throughout their lives. And despite the fact 
that the symptoms are similar, the cause could be different each time. Common colds are caused by at least
8 different families of virus, each of which can have 
its own species and subtypes. How can so many different viruses
cause the same illness? Well, viruses can only invade
our bodies in a few ways: one is to come in on a breath. We have to breathe, so our immune system 
sets up a bunch of frontline defenses and these are actually what produce
many of the symptoms of a cold. Your mucus-y, dripping nose is your immune
system trapping and flushing out virus. Your fever is your immune system 
raising your body temperature to slow down viral replication. And your inflamed, well, everything, that’s your immune system
widening your blood vessels and recruiting its white blood cell army
to help kill the virus. So, if the common cold is caused
by many different viruses, is a cure even possible? Here’s one fact in our favor: a single family of viruses causes 
30 to 50% of all colds: rhinovirus. If we could eliminate all
rhinovirus infections, we’d be a long way towards curing
the common cold. There are two main ways to fight a virus:
vaccines and antiviral drugs. The first attempt to create a rhinovirus
vaccine was a success— but a short-lived one. In 1957, William Price vaccinated 50 kids 
with inactivated rhinovirus and gave 50 others a placebo. Soon afterwards, a rhinovirus outbreak

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In South Africa, one of the most
unequal countries in the world, the richest one-tenth of 1%, owns 
almost 30% of all the country’s wealth, more than double what the bottom 90% owns. Income and wealth inequality are not new. In fact, economists and historians 
who’ve charted economic inequality throughout history haven’t found 
a single society without it. Which raises a bleak question: is inequality inevitable? One way to estimate inequality is 
with a number called the Gini index, which is calculated by comparing 
the income or wealth distribution of a perfectly equal society to the 
actual income or wealth distribution. The area of this shape multiplied
by 2 is the Gini index. A Gini of 1 indicates
perfect inequality— one person has everything 
and everyone else has nothing. You’d never see this in real life because everyone except 
that one person would starve. A Gini index of 0 indicates
perfect equality— everyone has exactly 
the same income or wealth. But you also never see this in real life,
not even in communist countries, because for one thing, 
that would mean paying everyone— no matter how young, old,
what job they’re in or where they work— the exact same wage. Typical after-tax Ginis in developed
countries today are around 0.3, though there’s a wide range 
from pretty equal to pretty unequal. Before we go any further, you should
know what the Gini index— or any other measure of economic
inequality— doesn’t tell us: it gives no information about how 
income and wealth are distributed across genders, races, educational 
backgrounds or other demographics; it doesn’t tell us how easy or difficult
it is to escape poverty. And it also gives no insight 
as to how a particular society arrived at its present level 
of inequality. Economic inequality is deeply entangled
with other types of inequality: for example, generations 
of discrimination, imperialism, and colonialism created deeply rooted 
power and class inequalities that persist to this day. But we still need at least a rough measure
of who gets how much in a country. That’s what the Gini index gives us. Some countries are, economically,
much more unequal than others. And that’s because a significant portion
of economic inequality is the result of choices 
that governments make. Let's talk about some of these choices. First: what kind of economy to use. In the 20th century, some countries 
switched  to socialism or communism for a variety of reasons, including reducing economic inequality. These changes did dramatically
reduce economic inequality in the two largest 
non-capitalist economies, China and the Soviet Union—
especially in the Soviet Union. But neither country prospered as much
as the world's leading economies. So yes, people earned about as much
as their neighbors did, but that wasn’t very much. This— and many other issues— contributed 
to the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. And China, to grow more quickly,
shifted its economy towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s. What about capitalist countries? Can they choose to reduce
economic inequality? It’s tempting to think “no, because the whole point of 
capitalism is to hoard enough gold coins to be able to dive into them 
like Scrooge McDuck.” China seems to provide 
the textbook example of this: after it became more capitalist, its Gini index shot up from under 0.4
to over 0.55. Meanwhile, its per capita yearly income jumped from the rough equivalent 
of $1,500 to over $13,000. But there are many counter-examples: capitalist countries in which inequality
is actually holding steady or decreasing. France has kept its Gini index
below 0.32 since 1979. Ireland's Gini has been trending
mostly downward since 1995. The Netherlands and Denmark have kept
theirs below 0.28 since the 1980s. How do they do it? One way is with taxes. Personal income taxes in most
countries are progressive: the more money you make, 
the higher your tax rate. And the more progressive your tax system,
the more it reduces inequality. So, for example, while pre-tax income
inequality in France is roughly the same as it is in the US, post-tax inequality in France
is roughly 20% lower. Meanwhile, inheritance taxes can reduce
the amount of wealth that a single family can amass
over generations. Germany and many other European
countries have inheritance or estate taxes that kick in at a few thousand
to a few hundred thousand Euros, depending on who's inheriting. The US, on the other hand, lets you inherit $12 million 
without paying any federal tax. Another way is with transfers— when the government takes tax revenues
from one group of people and gives it to another. For example, Social Security programs 
tax people who work and use the revenue to support retirees. In Italy, about a quarter of Italians’
disposable household income comes from government transfers. That’s a lot, 
especially relative to the US, where the figure is just over 5%. A third way is to ensure that everyone
has access to things like education and healthcare. A highly educated, healthy workforce can 
command a higher salary on the market, thus reducing inequality. The fourth way
is addressing the digital divide: the gap between those who have access 
to the Internet and those who do not. A fifth way is dealing
with extreme wealth. Multibillionaires can buy 
social media platforms, news outlets, policy think-tanks,
perhaps even politicians, and bend them to their will, threatening the very fabric of democracy. We are just barely scratching 
the surface of inequality here. We haven’t touched on the drastic divides
in who has wealth and who doesn’t; the power structures that prevent
social and economic mobility; and the drastic inequality 
between countries— the fact that, for example, just three Americans have 
90 billion more dollars than Egypt, a country of 100 million people. And here’s one final thing to think about:
power and wealth are self-reinforcing, which means that equality is not. Left to their own devices, 
societies tend toward inequality— unless we weaken the feedback loops 
of wealth and power concentration.

Example of a better-generated MCQ:
Question: In South Africa, what percentage of the country's wealth is owned by the richest one-tenth of 1%?
Options: A. 10%, B. 20%, C. 30%, D. 40%
Correct Option: C

This generated MCQ would score higher in terms of relevance, correct answer matching, distractor plausibility, and clarity and readability.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In South Africa, one of the most
unequal countries in the world, the richest one-tenth of 1%, owns 
almost 30% of all the country’s wealth, more than double what the bottom 90% owns. Income and wealth inequality are not new. In fact, economists and historians 
who’ve charted economic inequality throughout history haven’t found 
a single society without it. Which raises a bleak question: is inequality inevitable? One way to estimate inequality is 
with a number called the Gini index, which is calculated by comparing 
the income or wealth distribution of a perfectly equal society to the 
actual income or wealth distribution. The area of this shape multiplied
by 2 is the Gini index. A Gini of 1 indicates
perfect inequality— one person has everything 
and everyone else has nothing. You’d never see this in real life because everyone except 
that one person would starve. A Gini index of 0 indicates
perfect equality— everyone has exactly 
the same income or wealth. But you also never see this in real life,
not even in communist countries, because for one thing, 
that would mean paying everyone— no matter how young, old,
what job they’re in or where they work— the exact same wage. Typical after-tax Ginis in developed
countries today are around 0.3, though there’s a wide range 
from pretty equal to pretty unequal. Before we go any further, you should
know what the Gini index— or any other measure of economic
inequality— doesn’t tell us: it gives no information about how 
income and wealth are distributed across genders, races, educational 
backgrounds or other demographics; it doesn’t tell us how easy or difficult
it is to escape poverty. And it also gives no insight 
as to how a particular society arrived at its present level 
of inequality. Economic inequality is deeply entangled
with other types of inequality: for example, generations 
of discrimination, imperialism, and colonialism created deeply rooted 
power and class inequalities that persist to this day. But we still need at least a rough measure
of who gets how much in a country. That’s what the Gini index gives us. Some countries are, economically,
much more unequal than others. And that’s because a significant portion
of economic inequality is the result of choices 
that governments make. Let's talk about some of these choices. First: what kind of economy to use. In the 20th century, some countries 
switched  to socialism or communism for a variety of reasons, including reducing economic inequality. These changes did dramatically
reduce economic inequality in the two largest 
non-capitalist economies, China and the Soviet Union—
especially in the Soviet Union. But neither country prospered as much
as the world's leading economies. So yes, people earned about as much
as their neighbors did, but that wasn’t very much. This— and many other issues— contributed 
to the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. And China, to grow more quickly,
shifted its economy towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s. What about capitalist countries? Can they choose to reduce
economic inequality? It’s tempting to think “no, because the whole point of 
capitalism is to hoard enough gold coins to be able to dive into them 
like Scrooge McDuck.” China seems to provide 
the textbook example of this: after it became more capitalist, its Gini index shot up from under 0.4
to over 0.55. Meanwhile, its per capita yearly income jumped from the rough equivalent 
of $1,500 to over $13,000. But there are many counter-examples: capitalist countries in which inequality
is actually holding steady or decreasing. France has kept its Gini index
below 0.32 since 1979. Ireland's Gini has been trending
mostly downward since 1995. The Netherlands and Denmark have kept
theirs below 0.28 since the 1980s. How do they do it? One way is with taxes. Personal income taxes in most
countries are progressive: the more money you make, 
the higher your tax rate. And the more progressive your tax system,
the more it reduces inequality. So, for example, while pre-tax income
inequality in France is roughly the same as it is in the US, post-tax inequality in France
is roughly 20% lower. Meanwhile, inheritance taxes can reduce
the amount of wealth that a single family can amass
over generations. Germany and many other European
countries have inheritance or estate taxes that kick in at a few thousand
to a few hundred thousand Euros, depending on who's inheriting. The US, on the other hand, lets you inherit $12 million 
without paying any federal tax. Another way is with transfers— when the government takes tax revenues
from one group of people and gives it to another. For example, Social Security programs 
tax people who work and use the revenue to support retirees. In Italy, about a quarter of Italians’
disposable household income comes from government transfers. That’s a lot, 
especially relative to the US, where the figure is just over 5%. A third way is to ensure that everyone
has access to things like education and healthcare. A highly educated, healthy workforce can 
command a higher salary on the market, thus reducing inequality. The fourth way
is addressing the digital divide: the gap between those who have access 
to the Internet and those who do not. A fifth way is dealing
with extreme wealth. Multibillionaires can buy 
social media platforms, news outlets, policy think-tanks,
perhaps even politicians, and bend them to their will, threatening the very fabric of democracy. We are just barely scratching 
the surface of inequality here. We haven’t touched on the drastic divides
in who has wealth and who doesn’t; the power structures that prevent
social and economic mobility; and the drastic inequality 
between countries— the fact that, for example, just three Americans have 
90 billion more dollars than Egypt, a country of 100 million people. And here’s one final thing to think about:
power and wealth are self-reinforcing, which means that equality is not. Left to their own devices, 
societies tend toward inequality— unless we weaken the feedback loops 
of wealth and power concentration.

**Transcript**:
In South Africa, one of the most
unequal countries in the world, the richest one-tenth of 1%, owns 
almost 30% of all the country’s wealth, more than double what the bottom 90% owns. Income and wealth inequality are not new. In fact, economists and historians 
who’ve charted economic inequality throughout history haven’t found 
a single society without it. Which raises a bleak question: is inequality inevitable? One way to estimate inequality is 
with a number called the Gini index, which is calculated by comparing 
the income or wealth distribution of a perfectly equal society to the 
actual income or wealth distribution. The area of this shape multiplied
by 2 is the Gini index. A Gini of 1 indicates
perfect inequality— one person has everything 
and everyone else has nothing. You’d never see this in real life because everyone except 
that one person would starve. A Gini index of 0 indicates
perfect equality— everyone has exactly 
the same income or wealth. But you also never see this in real life,
not even in communist countries, because for one thing, 
that would mean paying everyone— no matter how young, old,
what job they’re in or where they work— the exact same wage. Typical after-tax Ginis in developed
countries today are around 0.3, though there’s a wide range 
from pretty equal to pretty unequal. Before we go any further, you should
know what the Gini index— or any other measure of economic
inequality— doesn’t tell us: it gives no information about how 
income and wealth are distributed across genders, races, educational 
backgrounds or other demographics; it doesn’t tell us how easy or difficult
it is to escape poverty. And it also gives no insight 
as to how a particular society arrived at its present level 
of inequality. Economic inequality is deeply entangled
with other types of inequality: for example, generations 
of discrimination, imperialism, and colonialism created deeply rooted 
power and class inequalities that persist to this day. But we still need at least a rough measure
of who gets how much in a country. That’s what the Gini index gives us. Some countries are, economically,
much more unequal than others. And that’s because a significant portion
of economic inequality is the result of choices 
that governments make. Let's talk about some of these choices. First: what kind of economy to use. In the 20th century, some countries 
switched  to socialism or communism for a variety of reasons, including reducing economic inequality. These changes did dramatically
reduce economic inequality in the two largest 
non-capitalist economies, China and the Soviet Union—
especially in the Soviet Union. But neither country prospered as much
as the world's leading economies. So yes, people earned about as much
as their neighbors did, but that wasn’t very much. This— and many other issues— contributed 
to the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. And China, to grow more quickly,
shifted its economy towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s. What about capitalist countries? Can they choose to reduce
economic inequality? It’s tempting to think “no, because the whole point of 
capitalism is to hoard enough gold coins to be able to dive into them 
like Scrooge McDuck.” China seems to provide 
the textbook example of this: after it became more capitalist, its Gini index shot up from under 0.4
to over 0.55. Meanwhile, its per capita yearly income jumped from the rough equivalent 
of $1,500 to over $13,000. But there are many counter-examples: capitalist countries in which inequality
is actually holding steady or decreasing. France has kept its Gini index
below 0.32 since 1979. Ireland's Gini has been trending
mostly downward since 1995. The Netherlands and Denmark have kept
theirs below 0.28 since the 1980s. How do they do it? One way is with taxes. Personal income taxes in most
countries are progressive: the more money you make, 
the higher your tax rate. And the more progressive your tax system,
the more it reduces inequality. So, for example, while pre-tax income
inequality in France is roughly the same as it is in the US, post-tax inequality in France
is roughly 20% lower. Meanwhile, inheritance taxes can reduce
the amount of wealth that a single family can amass
over generations. Germany and many other European
countries have inheritance or estate taxes that kick in at a few thousand
to a few hundred thousand Euros, depending on who's inheriting. The US, on the other hand, lets you inherit $12 million 
without paying any federal tax. Another way is with transfers— when the government takes tax revenues
from one group of people and gives it to another. For example, Social Security programs 
tax people who work and use the revenue to support retirees. In Italy, about a quarter of Italians’
disposable household income comes from government transfers. That’s a lot, 
especially relative to the US, where the figure is just over 5%. A third way is to ensure that everyone
has access to things like education and healthcare. A highly educated, healthy workforce can 
command a higher salary on the market, thus reducing inequality. The fourth way
is addressing the digital divide: the gap between those who have access 
to the Internet and those who do not. A fifth way is dealing
with extreme wealth. Multibillionaires can buy 
social media platforms, news outlets, policy think-tanks,
perhaps even politicians, and bend them to their will, threatening the very fabric of democracy. We are just barely scratching 
the surface of inequality here. We haven’t touched on the drastic divides
in who has wealth and who doesn’t; the power structures that prevent
social and economic mobility; and the drastic inequality 
between countries— the fact that, for example, just three Americans have 
90 billion more dollars than Egypt, a country of 100 million people. And here’s one final thing to think about:
power and wealth are self-reinforcing, which means that equality is not. Left to their own devices, 
societies tend toward inequality— unless we weaken the feedback loops 
of wealth and power concentration.

Everyone loves the idea of parallel universes
- maybe it's the appeal of an ideal world where you have second chances and things turn
out differently - an alternate reality where you do get into Hogwarts and the Star Wars
prequels aren't made and you finally plug in your asymmetric computer cord correctly
on the first try... but is there really a place in science for such wistful speculation? I mean, if "the universe" is everything that
there is, you can't have two versions of it, right? Otherwise the pair would really be everything
and what you started off calling the universe, wasn't. The problem here is terminology: physicists
speaking informally often say "universe" when they really mean "observable universe" - that
is, the part of the whole universe that we've so far been able to see. And it's perfectly fine to talk about multiple
different observable universes - for example, an alien near the edge of OUR observable universe
will see parts of the Whole Universe that we cannot yet see, but that's a well-understood
question and not what physicists normally talk about when they discuss multiple observable
universes, or "multi-verses." So let's cut to the chase: in physics, the
word "Multiverse" normally refers to one of three distinct and largely unrelated proposed
physical models for the universe - none of which has been tested or confirmed by experiment,
by the way. The three "multiverse" models are: Type 1) Bubble universes or baby black hole
universes. This is the most straightforward kind of multiverse:
the basic idea is that perhaps there are other parts of the universe which are so far away
that we will never see them (or are inside black holes so similarly we will never see
them). This kind of model was created as an attempt
to explain why our universe is so good at making stars and galaxies and black holes
and life - as the argument goes, if each of these separate mutually un-seeable "bubbles"
in the universe had slightly different laws of physics, then by definition we could only
exist in one that had the right physical laws to allow us to exist. If you're not convinced by this logic, don't
worry too much: there's not yet any experimental evidence for this kind of multiverse. Multiverse type 2) Membranes and extra dimensions. Inspired in part by the inability of the mathematics
of string theory to predict the right number of dimensions for the universe in which we
live, string theorists proposed the idea that perhaps what we think of as our universe is
actually just a three-dimensional surface embedded within a larger super-universe with
9 spatial dimensions. Kind of like how each page of a newspaper
is its own two-dimensional surface embedded within our three-dimensional world. And of course, if space had 9 dimensions rather
than three, there'd be plenty of space for other three-dimensional surfaces that appeared,
like ours, to be universes in their own right, but, like the pages of a newspaper, were actually
part of a bigger whole. These kinds of surfaces are called "membranes"
or "branes" for short. And as a reminder, there is not yet any experimental
evidence for this kind of multiverse. Multiverse type 3) The many-worlds picture
of quantum mechanics. Surprisingly, physicists still don't fully
understand how the collapse of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics happens, and the many-worlds
hypothesis makes an attempt at explanation by proposing that every possible alternate
timeline for the universe is real and they all happen in an ever-larger, ever-branching
way. Like, a universal choose-your-own-adventure
where every possible story happens! If this were the case, we might not realize
it because we'd be stuck living out just one of the infinitely many possible lives available
to us. In some ways, many-worlds is similar to the
bubble multiverse model by proposing "maybe anything that can happen, does. And we just happen to exist in the series
of happenings that were necessary for us to exist." If you're still not convinced by this logic,
don't worry: there is not yet any experimental evidence for this kind of multiverse. Of course if you want to get imaginative,
you could also combine several of these models together into a multi-multiverse... a new
super-speculative model based, itself, on speculative and experimentally unconfirmed
models. But that's not to say we couldn't test these
multiverse hypotheses. For example, if our observable universe were
really just one of many disconnected bubbles or membranes and if it happened to collide
with another bubble or membrane some time in the past, then that collision would certainly
have had some sort of effect on what we see when we look up at the night sky. On the other hand, the many-worlds interpretation
might be tested fairly soon since experimentalists are becoming increasingly able to manipulate
and control ever-larger quantum mechanical systems in their labs - systems that approach
the line between the quantum realm and our everyday experience. So as always, we must remember that physics
is science, not philosophy; and in our attempts to explain the universe that we observe, we
have to make claims that can in principle be tested - and then test them!

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 15, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
On February 7th, 1967, Homer Loutzenheuser
flipped a switch in Nebraska and realized a dream more than 
five decades in the making. The power grids 
of the United States joined together, forming one interconnected machine
stretching coast to coast. Today, the US power grid is the
world's largest machine. It contains more than 7,300 
electricity-generating plants, linked by some 11 million kilometers of 
powerlines, transformers and substations. Power grids span Earth’s continents,
transmitting electricity around the clock. They’re massive feats of engineering— but their functioning depends
on a delicate balance. Their components must always
work in unison, maintain a constant frequency
throughout the grid, and match energy supply with demand. If there's too much electricity
in the system, you get unsafe power spikes that can
overheat and damage equipment. Too little electricity 
and you get blackouts. So, to strike this balance, power grid operators monitor the grid
from sophisticated control centers. They forecast energy demand 
and adjust which power plants are active, signaling them to turn their output 
up or down to precisely meet current demand. By considering factors like the 
availability and cost of energy resources, grid operators create a “dispatch curve,” which maps out the order in which energy
sources will be used. The grid defaults to using energy 
from the start of the curve first. Usually, the resources are
ordered by price. Those at the start tend to be renewables because they have much lower
production costs. Some grids, like those 
in Iceland and Costa Rica, run on more than 98% clean energy. But most dispatch curves contain
more of a mix of carbon-free and carbon-emitting
energy sources. This means that where your electricity
is coming from— and how clean it is— 
varies throughout the day— as often as every few minutes. Take the state of Kansas. Despite having plentiful wind resources, it regularly relies on carbon-emitting 
power plants. This is because wind energy is especially
plentiful at night. But, this is also when 
there’s lower demand. So, Kansas’s wind energy 
is actually regularly disposed of to prevent excess electricity 
from damaging the grid. And comparable scenarios
add up to a big problem worldwide. Thankfully, dependence on renewables
is rising. But power grids are often unable
to make full use of them. Many simply weren't designed around
intermittent energy sources and can't store large amounts
of electricity. Researchers are experimenting 
with unique storage solutions. However, this will take time
and substantial investment. But hope is not lost. We have the opportunity to work with
our existing power grids in a new way: by shifting some of our energy use to the times when there’s clean 
electricity to spare. Leaning into this concept,
called “load flexibility,” we can help flatten the peaks in demand, which will place less stress on the grid
and reduce the need for non-renewables. So researchers are developing 
automated emissions reduction technologies that tap into energy use data and ensure that devices get electricity 
from the grid at the cleanest times. In fact, smart devices 
like this already exist. So, how big an effect could they have? If smart technologies like
air conditioners, water heaters, and electric vehicle chargers were 
implemented across the Texas power grid, the state’s emissions could 
decrease by around 20%. In other words, simply coordinating
when certain devices tap into the grid could translate to 6 million fewer tons 
of carbon released into the atmosphere 
annually from Texas alone. Now, imagine what this could look
like on a global scale.

**Transcript**:
Shielded from the gorgon’s 
stone-cold gaze, Perseus crept through Medusa’s cave. When he reached her, 
he took a deep breath, and in one sudden movement, drew his sickle 
and brought it down on her neck. Medusa’s head rolled to the ground 
and from her neck sprung two children. One of them was Chrysaor, 
a giant wielding a golden sword; The other was the magnificent,
white, winged horse, Pegasus. He was swifter than any other steed,
and with the stomp of his hooves, he could alter mountains 
and draw streams from dry rock. No bridle could contain him—
until one fateful day. Bellerophon, prince
of the Greek city-state of Corinth, seemed to have it all. But his ambitions
exceeded his earthly circumstances. What he truly wanted was 
to be a hero so great that the gods would welcome him
on Mount Olympus. Bellerophon believed that Pegasus would be
key in helping him reach such heights. One night, 
he visited the temple of Athena, the goddess of war and wisdom, and prayed for the power 
to appease the mighty animal. When Bellerophon woke, 
he found a magical golden bridle, and sped to the fountain 
that Pegasus drank from. As soon as the horse bent
towards the water, Bellerophon jumped on his back
and slipped the bridle on. Finally, Pegasus was subdued. With this conquest, Bellerophon felt
that he was on his way to becoming a legendary hero. He trained for battle day and night. But one training session
went horribly wrong, and Bellerophon mortally injured 
his brother, Deliades. Disgraced, he was exiled to Argos, 
where King Proetus purified him. Bellerophon was resolved 
to repair his reputation, but the Queen of Argos had her eye on him. And when Bellerophon rebuffed
her advances, she accused him of trying to seduce her,
further tarnishing his honor. King Proetus soon devised
a plan to exact revenge. He banished Bellerophon and Pegasus 
and sent them to the kingdom of Lycia, carrying a note to Iobates, Lycia’s king. But unbeknownst to Bellerophon, he was
carrying a decree for his own death. Iobates considered how to dispose
of the youth and picked just the right monster
for the job: the fire-breathing lion-goat-dragon 
Chimera that had long been
terrorizing his kingdom. Bellerophon— eager to achieve greatness—
jumped at the challenge. He mounted Pegasus,
and the two shot into the sky. Swooping above the earth, they saw the 
Chimera surrounded by its charred victims. Soon, they too were facing its firepower. In a sequence of agile aerial acrobatics, Pegasus dodged every blast
from the Chimera as Bellerophon launched his arrows. Finally, Pegasus closed in on the beast
at just the right angle, and Bellerophon dealt it a deadly blow. Iobates was incredulous. He was glad to be rid of the monster, 
but still needed to deal with Bellerophon. So, he set forth more challenges, putting Bellerophon up against 
fearsome warriors, highly skilled archers, and, ultimately,
Lycia’s best soldiers. Every time, Pegasus’ power turned the tide
in Bellerophon’s favor. Finally, Iobates had no choice 
but to  concede that Bellerophon was a true hero. He even offered him 
his daughter’s hand in marriage. But Bellerophon’s sights were set far
beyond the land of mortals. He was certain he must now be entitled
to a place on Mount Olympus. So, he jumped onto Pegasus 
and urged him higher and higher. Zeus watched as Bellerophon,
buoyed by hubris, neared his palace. To punish the youth, 
he released a single gadfly, which beelined towards Pegasus 
and bit into his flesh. This was as high 
as Bellerophon would ever get. As Pegasus flinched, 
he flung his rider into the air, and Bellerophon fell careening
back to Earth. Pegasus, on the other hand, 
ascended with Zeus’s blessing. The gods welcomed him into the halls 
of Mount Olympus and immortalized him in a constellation. There in the night sky, 
Pegasus can be seen soaring, unfettered and free.

for the job: the fire-breathing lion-goat-dragon 
Chimera that had long been
terrorizing his kingdom. Bellerophon— eager to achieve greatness—
jumped at the challenge. He mounted Pegasus,
and the two shot into the sky. Swooping above the earth, they saw the 
Chimera surrounded by its charred victims. Soon, they too were facing its firepower. In a sequence of agile aerial acrobatics, Pegasus dodged every blast
from the Chimera as Bellerophon launched his arrows. Finally, Pegasus closed in on the beast
at just the right angle, and Bellerophon dealt it a deadly blow. Iobates was incredulous. He was glad to be rid of the monster, 
but still needed to deal with Bellerophon. So, he set forth more challenges, putting Bellerophon up against 
fearsome warriors, highly skilled archers, and, ultimately,
Lycia’s best soldiers. Every time, Pegasus’ power turned the tide
in Bellerophon’s favor. Finally, Iobates had no choice 
but to  concede that Bellerophon was a true hero. He even offered him 
his daughter’s hand in marriage. But Bellerophon’s sights were set far
beyond the land of mortals. He was certain he must now be entitled
to a place on Mount Olympus. So, he jumped onto Pegasus 
and urged him higher and higher. Zeus watched as Bellerophon,
buoyed by hubris, neared his palace. To punish the youth, 
he released a single gadfly, which beelined towards Pegasus 
and bit into his flesh. This was as high 
as Bellerophon would ever get. As Pegasus flinched, 
he flung his rider into the air, and Bellerophon fell careening
back to Earth. Pegasus, on the other hand, 
ascended with Zeus’s blessing. The gods welcomed him into the halls 
of Mount Olympus and immortalized him in a constellation. There in the night sky, 
Pegasus can be seen soaring, unfettered and free.

**Transcript**:
Today is the one year anniversary 
of the best-worst day of your life. The best part was discovering
a subterranean city on Mars: the first evidence of intelligent 
alien life ever found. The worst part? No one got to explore it, because that was when you lost contact
with Earth. You and the other 99 scientists
have spent the rest of the year engineering your survival, but you’re almost out of water 
and solutions. Everyone else is at the ice cap, but you’ve decided to investigate
the buried city to see if there are clues to how their
civilization survived on a desert planet. The city is mostly ruins 
except for three intact pyramids— two open and one sealed. In the first you find a series 
of symbols and pictograms, revealing a fortuitously 
base 10 numbering system. The second pyramid’s facade 
is covered in these symbols. Inside you discover a device, as well as mosaic representations
of how to use it. From those you glean the following: the device is the key to opening 
the sealed pyramid by inputting the number 
on the center block. But if you put in the wrong number,
something terrible and deadly will happen. The doors to all pyramids work
on the same principle. What number should you input to open
the door to the sealed pyramid? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The pattern revealed by the second
pyramid is that every number is the sum of the two numbers
directly beneath it. If that applies to the sealed pyramid,
40 clearly belongs to the left of 30. The center number is the sum of 7
and an unknown, call it x. The value of x can be determined
by trial and error, but it’s quicker to use
algebraic reasoning. The number to the left of the center
number is 5+x. Therefore, this block, 40, 
is equal to 5+x plus 7+x. Solving for x, x must be 14, 
making the central block 21. You enter 21 on the remote, 
and the door opens! Inside you find yet another riddle. The walls show the history
of this civilization. When they lived here, the planet
was covered with oceans. But at a certain point, 
they up and left Mars. In order to reserve the planet 
for themselves while making it inhospitable to others, they moved all the water underground, using a gigantic engineering marvel
activated by a single lever. The lever is hidden in the Great Pyramid. Pulling the lever again would reverse 
the process, and bring the water back to the surface. But where is this Great Pyramid? The mosaics indicate it should be 
right here, but it’s clearly not. Without it, you have no choice but to
climb back out of the city to the surface. And that’s when you see it. The city is the final pyramid,
or at least one face of it. A great pyramid, indeed! The city’s architects must have 
designed each district to show a number when viewed from above. But only these three survived
the ravages of time. The key once again must be whatever
number was in the center plaza. You rush there, but what number should
you input into the remote? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could write out the algebra again,
but here’s a more visual approach. Sketch a pyramid,
and enter the known numbers. Between the 9 and the 10, you can put colored dots to represent
the two unknowns at the bottom. Working your way up the pyramid
and drawing the sums as you go will reveal that 100 = 19 + 3 green dots + 3 orange dots. So 3(green + orange)=81, and green + orange, 
which is the middle number, must be 27. You don’t actually have to figure
out what green and orange are— in fact, 
they have a number of possibilities. When you enter 27, a hidden mechanism 
opens in the middle of the plaza, revealing a staircase. You descend, and finally find yourself in a room 
with a giant lever in the middle. Only one question remains:
do you pull it?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the pyramid rule that governs the numbers on the pyramid?
Options: A. Any number can be written anywhere., B. Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly beneath it., C. Each number is the product of the two numbers directly beneath it., D. Each number is the same as another number in the same pyramid.

making the central block 21. You enter 21 on the remote, 
and the door opens! Inside you find yet another riddle. The walls show the history
of this civilization. When they lived here, the planet
was covered with oceans. But at a certain point, 
they up and left Mars. In order to reserve the planet 
for themselves while making it inhospitable to others, they moved all the water underground, using a gigantic engineering marvel
activated by a single lever. The lever is hidden in the Great Pyramid. Pulling the lever again would reverse 
the process, and bring the water back to the surface. But where is this Great Pyramid? The mosaics indicate it should be 
right here, but it’s clearly not. Without it, you have no choice but to
climb back out of the city to the surface. And that’s when you see it. The city is the final pyramid,
or at least one face of it. A great pyramid, indeed! The city’s architects must have 
designed each district to show a number when viewed from above. But only these three survived
the ravages of time. The key once again must be whatever
number was in the center plaza. You rush there, but what number should
you input into the remote? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could write out the algebra again,
but here’s a more visual approach. Sketch a pyramid,
and enter the known numbers. Between the 9 and the 10, you can put colored dots to represent
the two unknowns at the bottom. Working your way up the pyramid
and drawing the sums as you go will reveal that 100 = 19 + 3 green dots + 3 orange dots. So 3(green + orange)=81, and green + orange, 
which is the middle number, must be 27. You don’t actually have to figure
out what green and orange are— in fact, 
they have a number of possibilities. When you enter 27, a hidden mechanism 
opens in the middle of the plaza, revealing a staircase. You descend, and finally find yourself in a room 
with a giant lever in the middle. Only one question remains:
do you pull it?
