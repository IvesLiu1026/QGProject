Welcome to the TED-Ed beta website tour. I'm Logan Smalley, I'm Bedirhan Cinar, I'm Jordan Reeves, and I'm Stephanie Lo. We represent the TED-Ed team. We're going to tell you about
how the website is organized, about the lessons
that surround each video, how you can customize or flip
your own lesson, and how you can measure
the lesson's effect on your class or the world. Towards the end of the tour, we'll reveal one more major feature that directly affects
every person viewing this video. Let's get started with the home page. On the home page,
you'll find original TED-Ed videos, each is a lesson recorded
by an actual educator that's visualized
by a professional animator. You can nominate educators and animators in the "Get Involved" section of the site. The TED-Ed library can be browsed
through two different lenses. Learners can use the "Series" view
to browse videos thematically and based on their own curiosity. And teachers can use
the browse by "Subject" view to find the perfect short video
to show in class or to assign as homework. Every video on TED-Ed
is accompanied by a lesson. These lessons don't replace good teaching, but they can be supplementary resources for students and teachers
around the world. Let's look at this one, created by a teacher in the US
and an animator in the UK. When you arrive on the lesson page,
simply click play; the video will continue to play as you navigate the lesson's sections
that surround it. In the "Quick Quiz" section, you'll find multiple-choice questions that check for basic
comprehension of the video. You get real-time feedback on your answers and if you get one wrong,
you can use the video hint. You'll find open-answer questions
in the "Think" section. And in the "Dig Deeper" section, you'll find additional resources
for exploring the topic. You can complete the lessons anonymously, but if you log in, you can track
your own learning across the site. Just visit the "Recent Activity" feed, and you'll find answers you've saved to lessons that you've already
started or completed. And now to one of the most powerful
features of the TED-Ed website: flipping a lesson. Flipping a featured lesson allows you
to edit each of the lesson's sections. You can edit the title
as it relates to your class. You can use the "Let's Begin" section to provide instructions
or context for the lesson. You can select or deselect
any "Quick Quiz" question. In the "Think" section, you can add your own
open-answer questions. And in the "Dig Deeper" section, you can use the resources provided
or add your own. When you finish flipping a lesson, it'll publish to a new and unique URL. And because the link is unique, it can measure the progress
of any learner you share it with. You can use it to measure participation and accuracy of any individual
student's answers. So that's how you flip
a featured TED-Ed video, We've got one more major feature
to tell you about. Using the TED-Ed platform, you can flip any video from YouTube. That means you can create a lesson
around any TED Talk, any TEDx Talk, but also any of the other thousands
of great educational videos on YouTube, including the ones that you yourself
could record, upload and flip. And through flipping these lessons, together we'll create
a free and remarkable library of lessons worth sharing.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about nominating an educator or animator, and the correct option is to go to the "Get Involved" page.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the most similar, as it mentions browsing the TED-Ed library, which is related to exploring the website's features. However, it does not specifically ask about nominating an educator or animator.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the "Get Involved" section or a similar topic. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this criteria.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related, I would suggest Question 2, but with a low confidence level.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2 (with low confidence)

Note: A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically asks about nominating an educator or animator, which is not present in the provided set.

how the website is organized, about the lessons
that surround each video, how you can customize or flip
your own lesson, and how you can measure
the lesson's effect on your class or the world. Towards the end of the tour, we'll reveal one more major feature that directly affects
every person viewing this video. Let's get started with the home page. On the home page,
you'll find original TED-Ed videos, each is a lesson recorded
by an actual educator that's visualized
by a professional animator. You can nominate educators and animators in the "Get Involved" section of the site. The TED-Ed library can be browsed
through two different lenses. Learners can use the "Series" view
to browse videos thematically and based on their own curiosity. And teachers can use
the browse by "Subject" view to find the perfect short video
to show in class or to assign as homework. Every video on TED-Ed
is accompanied by a lesson. These lessons don't replace good teaching, but they can be supplementary resources for students and teachers
around the world. Let's look at this one, created by a teacher in the US
and an animator in the UK. When you arrive on the lesson page,
simply click play; the video will continue to play as you navigate the lesson's sections
that surround it. In the "Quick Quiz" section, you'll find multiple-choice questions that check for basic
comprehension of the video. You get real-time feedback on your answers and if you get one wrong,
you can use the video hint. You'll find open-answer questions
in the "Think" section. And in the "Dig Deeper" section, you'll find additional resources
for exploring the topic. You can complete the lessons anonymously, but if you log in, you can track
your own learning across the site. Just visit the "Recent Activity" feed, and you'll find answers you've saved to lessons that you've already
started or completed. And now to one of the most powerful
features of the TED-Ed website: flipping a lesson. Flipping a featured lesson allows you
to edit each of the lesson's sections. You can edit the title
as it relates to your class. You can use the "Let's Begin" section to provide instructions
or context for the lesson. You can select or deselect
any "Quick Quiz" question. In the "Think" section, you can add your own
open-answer questions. And in the "Dig Deeper" section, you can use the resources provided
or add your own. When you finish flipping a lesson, it'll publish to a new and unique URL. And because the link is unique, it can measure the progress
of any learner you share it with. You can use it to measure participation and accuracy of any individual
student's answers. So that's how you flip
a featured TED-Ed video, We've got one more major feature
to tell you about. Using the TED-Ed platform, you can flip any video from YouTube. That means you can create a lesson
around any TED Talk, any TEDx Talk, but also any of the other thousands
of great educational videos on YouTube, including the ones that you yourself
could record, upload and flip. And through flipping these lessons, together we'll create
a free and remarkable library of lessons worth sharing.

Evaluation Response:
Unfortunately, there is only one ground truth MCQ provided. I will match it with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set, but since there is only one generated MCQ, I will use it for the evaluation.

**MCQ Pair**:
Ground Truth MCQ:
Question: How do you nominate an Educator or Animator?
Options: A. Go to the tour page, B. Go to the get involved page, C. Go to the about page, D. Send the TED-Ed team an email
Correct Option: B

Generated MCQ:
Question: How can learners browse the TED-Ed library?
Options: A. By subject or series., B. Only by series., C. Only by subject., D. By author or animator.
Correct Option: A

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.0000 (The generated question does not align with the content and intent of the ground truth question.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.0000 (The correct answer option in the generated question does not match the ground truth answer.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.5000 (The distractors in the generated question are plausible but not relevant to the ground truth question.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 1.0000 (The question and options are clear and understandable.)

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to the TED-Ed beta website tour. I'm Logan Smalley, I'm Bedirhan Cinar, I'm Jordan Reeves, and I'm Stephanie Lo. We represent the TED-Ed team. We're going to tell you about
how the website is organized, about the lessons
that surround each video, how you can customize or flip
your own lesson, and how you can measure
the lesson's effect on your class or the world. Towards the end of the tour, we'll reveal one more major feature that directly affects
every person viewing this video. Let's get started with the home page. On the home page,
you'll find original TED-Ed videos, each is a lesson recorded
by an actual educator that's visualized
by a professional animator. You can nominate educators and animators in the "Get Involved" section of the site. The TED-Ed library can be browsed
through two different lenses. Learners can use the "Series" view
to browse videos thematically and based on their own curiosity. And teachers can use
the browse by "Subject" view to find the perfect short video
to show in class or to assign as homework. Every video on TED-Ed
is accompanied by a lesson. These lessons don't replace good teaching, but they can be supplementary resources for students and teachers
around the world. Let's look at this one, created by a teacher in the US
and an animator in the UK. When you arrive on the lesson page,
simply click play; the video will continue to play as you navigate the lesson's sections
that surround it. In the "Quick Quiz" section, you'll find multiple-choice questions that check for basic
comprehension of the video. You get real-time feedback on your answers and if you get one wrong,
you can use the video hint. You'll find open-answer questions
in the "Think" section. And in the "Dig Deeper" section, you'll find additional resources
for exploring the topic. You can complete the lessons anonymously, but if you log in, you can track
your own learning across the site. Just visit the "Recent Activity" feed, and you'll find answers you've saved to lessons that you've already
started or completed. And now to one of the most powerful
features of the TED-Ed website: flipping a lesson. Flipping a featured lesson allows you
to edit each of the lesson's sections. You can edit the title
as it relates to your class. You can use the "Let's Begin" section to provide instructions
or context for the lesson. You can select or deselect
any "Quick Quiz" question. In the "Think" section, you can add your own
open-answer questions. And in the "Dig Deeper" section, you can use the resources provided
or add your own. When you finish flipping a lesson, it'll publish to a new and unique URL. And because the link is unique, it can measure the progress
of any learner you share it with. You can use it to measure participation and accuracy of any individual
student's answers. So that's how you flip
a featured TED-Ed video, We've got one more major feature
to tell you about. Using the TED-Ed platform, you can flip any video from YouTube. That means you can create a lesson
around any TED Talk, any TEDx Talk, but also any of the other thousands
of great educational videos on YouTube, including the ones that you yourself
could record, upload and flip. And through flipping these lessons, together we'll create
a free and remarkable library of lessons worth sharing.
