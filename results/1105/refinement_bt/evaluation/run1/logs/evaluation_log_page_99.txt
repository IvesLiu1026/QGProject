Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

This question is about the "check" that Dr. King refers to in the speech, which is also the main topic of the ground truth MCQ. The correct option in Question 4 is "A bad check that had come back marked 'insufficient funds'", which is related to the idea that the promises of equality made in the Declaration of Independence have not been fulfilled, as mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, an even more similar question is Question 3, which is about the promise made by the architects of the Republic. This question is more similar in terms of content and intent, as it directly refers to the idea that the Declaration of Independence promised certain unalienable rights to all men.

Therefore, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3.

**Transcript**:
[Music] shall over we shall [Music] over my heart [Music] at this time I have the honor to present to you the moral leader of our nation I have the pleasure to present to you Dr Martin Luther King Jr [Applause] I am happy to join with you [Music] today in what will go down in [Music] history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation five score years ago a great American in whose symbolic Shadow We Stand today signed the Emancipation Proclamation this momentous decree [Music] came as a great Beacon Light Of Hope to millions of negro slaves who had been seared in the Flames of withering Injustice it came as a joyous Daybreak to end the long night of their captivity but 100 years later the Negro still is not free 100 years later the the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination 100 years later the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material Prosperity 100 years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in Exile in his own land and so we've come here today to dramatize the shameful condition inoc since we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check when The Architects of our Republic wrote The Magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence they were signing a promisory note to which every American was to fall out this note was a promise at all men yes black men as well as white men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promisory note in so far as her citizens of color are concerned instead of honoring this sacred obligation America has given the Negro people a bad check a check which has come back marked insufficient f [Applause] but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt we refuse to believe that that are insufficient funds and the great faults of opportunity of this nation so we've come to cash this check a check that will give us upon demand and the riches of freedom and the security of [Applause] Justice we have also come to this h of spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now this is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism now is the time yes it to make real the promises of democracy now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate Valley of segregation to the sunlet path of racial Justice now is the time to lift our nation from the quick Sands of racial Injustice to the solid rock of Brotherhood now is the time now to make Justice a reality for all of God's children it would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment this sweltering Summit of the negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until that is an invigorating aumn of freedom and equality 1963 is not an end but a beginning those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual [Applause] and there will be neither rest nor Tranquility in America until the Negro has granted his citizenship rights the whirlwinds or Revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of Justice emerges but that is something that I must say to my my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the Palace of Justice in the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful Deeds let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for Freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred we must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline we must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence again and again we must rise to the Majestic Heights of meeting physical force with soul Force The Marvelous new militancy which has andul the Negro Community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people for many of our White Brothers as evidenced by their presence here today have come to realize that their Destiny is tied up with our destiny and they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom we cannot walk alone and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always March ahead we cannot turn back there are those who are asking the devotes of civil rights when will you be satisfied we can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the V victim of the Unspeakable Horrors or police brutality we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the [Applause] Cities we cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro basic Mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one we we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by sign stating for whites only we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to [Music] [Applause] vote no no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied

**Transcript**:
In J.R.R.'s world, Gandalf is one of five wizards
sent by the Valar to guide the inhabitants of Middle Earth in their struggles
against the dark force of Sauron. Gandalf's body was mortal, subject to the physical
rules of Middle Earth, but his spirit was immortal, as seen when he died as Gandalf the Grey and resurrected as Gandalf the White. According to the Wachowski's script, an awakened human only has to link up and hack the neon binary
code of the Matrix to learn how to fly a helicopter
in a matter of seconds. Or if you are the One, or one of the Ones, you don't even need a helicopter,
you just need a cool pair of shades. Cheshire cats can juggle their own heads. iPads are rudimentary. No Quidditch match ends
until the Golden Snitch is caught. And the answer to the ultimate
question of life, the universe, and everything is most certainly 42. Just like real life,
fictional worlds operate consistently within a spectrum of physical
and societal rules. That's what makes these intricate worlds believable, comprehensible,
and worth exploring. In real life, the Law of Gravity
holds seven book sets of "Harry Potter" to millions of bookshelves
around the world. We know this to be true, but we also know that ever since J.K. typed the words wizard, wand, and "Wingardium Leviosa," that Law of Gravity has ceased to exist on the trillions of pages
resting between those bookends. Authors of science fiction and fantasy
literally build worlds. They make rules, maps, lineages, languages, cultures, universes, alternate universes within universes, and from those worlds sprout
story, after story, after story. When it's done well, readers can understand
fictional worlds and their rules just as well as the characters
that live in them do and sometimes, just as well or even better than the reader understands
the world outside of the book. But how? How can human-made squiggles on a page reflect lights into our eyes
that send signals to our brains that we logically and emotionally decode
as complex narratives that move us to fight, cry, sing, and think, that are strong enough not only to hold up a world that is completely invented by the author, but also to change
the reader's perspective on the real world that resumes only when the final squiggle is reached? I'm not sure anyone knows
the answer to that question, yet fantastical, fictional worlds
are created everyday in our minds, on computers, even on napkins at the restaurant
down the street. The truth is your imagination
and a willingness to, figuratively, live in your own world are all you need to get
started writing a novel. I didn't dream up Hogwarts
or the Star Wars' Cantina, but I have written some science thrillers
for kids and young adults. Here are some questions
and methods I've used to help build the worlds
in which those books take place. I start with a basic place and time. Whether that's a fantasy world
or a futuristic setting in the real world, it's important to know where you are
and whether you're working in the past, present, or future. I like to create a timeline showing how the world came to be. What past events have shaped
the way it is now? Then I brainstorm answers to questions that draw out the details
of my fictional world. What rules are in place here? This covers everything
from laws of gravity, or not, to the rules of society and the punishments
for individuals who break them. What kind of government
does this world have? Who has power, and who doesn't? What do people believe in here? And what does this society value most? Then it's time to think
about day-to-day life. What's the weather like in this world? Where do the inhabitants live
and work and go to school? What do they eat and how do they play? How do they treat their young
and their old? What relationships do they have
with the animals and plants of the world? And what do those animals
and plants look like? What kind of technology exists? Transportation? Communication? Access to information? There's so much to think about! So, spend some time living in those tasks
and the answers to those questions, and you're well on your way
to building your own fictional world. Once you know your world
as well as you hope your reader will, set your characters free in it
and see what happens. And ask yourself, "How does this world you created
shape the individuals who live in it? And what kind of conflict
is likely to emerge?" Answer those questions,
and you have your story. Good luck, future world-builder!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about an example of a rule in a fictional world, while Question 4 asks about the main challenge of creating a fictional world, which is to make it believable and comprehensible by establishing rules and consistency.

However, a closer look at the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly ask about identifying a rule in a fictional world. But Question 4 is related to the concept of rules in a fictional world, as it asks about the importance of making the world believable and comprehensible, which is achieved by establishing rules and consistency.

**Transcript**:
In J.R.R.'s world, Gandalf is one of five wizards
sent by the Valar to guide the inhabitants of Middle Earth in their struggles
against the dark force of Sauron. Gandalf's body was mortal, subject to the physical
rules of Middle Earth, but his spirit was immortal, as seen when he died as Gandalf the Grey and resurrected as Gandalf the White. According to the Wachowski's script, an awakened human only has to link up and hack the neon binary
code of the Matrix to learn how to fly a helicopter
in a matter of seconds. Or if you are the One, or one of the Ones, you don't even need a helicopter,
you just need a cool pair of shades. Cheshire cats can juggle their own heads. iPads are rudimentary. No Quidditch match ends
until the Golden Snitch is caught. And the answer to the ultimate
question of life, the universe, and everything is most certainly 42. Just like real life,
fictional worlds operate consistently within a spectrum of physical
and societal rules. That's what makes these intricate worlds believable, comprehensible,
and worth exploring. In real life, the Law of Gravity
holds seven book sets of "Harry Potter" to millions of bookshelves
around the world. We know this to be true, but we also know that ever since J.K. typed the words wizard, wand, and "Wingardium Leviosa," that Law of Gravity has ceased to exist on the trillions of pages
resting between those bookends. Authors of science fiction and fantasy
literally build worlds. They make rules, maps, lineages, languages, cultures, universes, alternate universes within universes, and from those worlds sprout
story, after story, after story. When it's done well, readers can understand
fictional worlds and their rules just as well as the characters
that live in them do and sometimes, just as well or even better than the reader understands
the world outside of the book. But how? How can human-made squiggles on a page reflect lights into our eyes
that send signals to our brains that we logically and emotionally decode
as complex narratives that move us to fight, cry, sing, and think, that are strong enough not only to hold up a world that is completely invented by the author, but also to change
the reader's perspective on the real world that resumes only when the final squiggle is reached? I'm not sure anyone knows
the answer to that question, yet fantastical, fictional worlds
are created everyday in our minds, on computers, even on napkins at the restaurant
down the street. The truth is your imagination
and a willingness to, figuratively, live in your own world are all you need to get
started writing a novel. I didn't dream up Hogwarts
or the Star Wars' Cantina, but I have written some science thrillers
for kids and young adults. Here are some questions
and methods I've used to help build the worlds
in which those books take place. I start with a basic place and time. Whether that's a fantasy world
or a futuristic setting in the real world, it's important to know where you are
and whether you're working in the past, present, or future. I like to create a timeline showing how the world came to be. What past events have shaped
the way it is now? Then I brainstorm answers to questions that draw out the details
of my fictional world. What rules are in place here? This covers everything
from laws of gravity, or not, to the rules of society and the punishments
for individuals who break them. What kind of government
does this world have? Who has power, and who doesn't? What do people believe in here? And what does this society value most? Then it's time to think
about day-to-day life. What's the weather like in this world? Where do the inhabitants live
and work and go to school? What do they eat and how do they play? How do they treat their young
and their old? What relationships do they have
with the animals and plants of the world? And what do those animals
and plants look like? What kind of technology exists? Transportation? Communication? Access to information? There's so much to think about! So, spend some time living in those tasks
and the answers to those questions, and you're well on your way
to building your own fictional world. Once you know your world
as well as you hope your reader will, set your characters free in it
and see what happens. And ask yourself, "How does this world you created
shape the individuals who live in it? And what kind of conflict
is likely to emerge?" Answer those questions,
and you have your story. Good luck, future world-builder!

**Transcript**:
Picture warm, gooey cookies, crunchy candies, velvety cakes, waffle cones piled high with ice cream. Is your mouth watering? Are you craving dessert? Why? What happens in the brain
that makes sugary foods so hard to resist? Sugar is a general term
used to describe a class of molecules called carbohydrates, and it's found in a wide variety
of food and drink. Just check the labels
on sweet products you buy. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, dextrose, and starch are all forms of sugar. So are high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, raw sugar, and honey. And sugar isn't just
in candies and desserts, it's also added to tomato sauce, yogurt, dried fruit,
flavored waters, or granola bars. Since sugar is everywhere,
it's important to understand how it affects the brain. What happens when sugar hits your tongue? And does eating a little bit of sugar
make you crave more? You take a bite of cereal. The sugars it contains activate
the sweet-taste receptors, part of the taste buds on the tongue. These receptors send a signal
up to the brain stem, and from there, it forks off
into many areas of the forebrain, one of which is the cerebral cortex. Different sections of the cerebral cortex
process different tastes: bitter, salty, umami, and, in our case, sweet. From here, the signal activates
the brain's reward system. This reward system is a series
of electrical and chemical pathways across several different
regions of the brain. It's a complicated network, but it helps answer a single,
subconscious question: should I do that again? That warm, fuzzy feeling you get
when you taste Grandma's chocolate cake? That's your reward system saying, "Mmm, yes!" And it's not just activated by food. Socializing, sexual behavior, and drugs are just a few examples
of things and experiences that also activate the reward system. But overactivating this reward system
kickstarts a series of unfortunate events: loss of control, craving,
and increased tolerance to sugar. Let's get back to our bite of cereal. It travels down into your stomach
and eventually into your gut. And guess what? There are sugar receptors here, too. They are not taste buds,
but they do send signals telling your brain that you're full or that your body should
produce more insulin to deal with the extra sugar
you're eating. The major currency
of our reward system is dopamine, an important chemical or neurotransmitter. There are many dopamine
receptors in the forebrain, but they're not evenly distributed. Certain areas contain dense
clusters of receptors, and these dopamine hot spots
are a part of our reward system. Drugs like alcohol, nicotine, or heroin send dopamine into overdrive, leading some people
to constantly seek that high, in other words, to be addicted. Sugar also causes dopamine to be released,
though not as violently as drugs. And sugar is rare
among dopamine-inducing foods. Broccoli, for example, has no effect, which probably explains why it's so hard to get
kids to eat their veggies. Speaking of healthy foods, let's say you're hungry
and decide to eat a balanced meal. You do, and dopamine levels spike
in the reward system hot spots. But if you eat that same dish
many days in a row, dopamine levels will spike less and less,
eventually leveling out. That's because when it comes to food, the brain evolved to pay special attention
to new or different tastes. Why? Two reasons: first, to detect food that's gone bad. And second, because the more variety
we have in our diet, the more likely we are
to get all the nutrients we need. To keep that variety up, we need to be able
to recognize a new food, and more importantly, we need
to want to keep eating new foods. And that's why the dopamine levels off
when a food becomes boring. Now, back to that meal. What happens if in place
of the healthy, balanced dish, you eat sugar-rich food instead? If you rarely eat sugar
or don't eat much at a time, the effect is similar
to that of the balanced meal. But if you eat too much,
the dopamine response does not level out. In other words, eating lots of sugar
will continue to feel rewarding. In this way, sugar behaves
a little bit like a drug. It's one reason people seem
to be hooked on sugary foods. So, think back to all those
different kinds of sugar. Each one is unique,
but every time any sugar is consumed, it kickstarts a domino effect in the brain
that sparks a rewarding feeling. Too much, too often,
and things can go into overdrive. So, yes, overconsumption of sugar
can have addictive effects on the brain, but a wedge of cake once
in a while won't hurt you.

**Transcript**:
Picture warm, gooey cookies, crunchy candies, velvety cakes, waffle cones piled high with ice cream. Is your mouth watering? Are you craving dessert? Why? What happens in the brain
that makes sugary foods so hard to resist? Sugar is a general term
used to describe a class of molecules called carbohydrates, and it's found in a wide variety
of food and drink. Just check the labels
on sweet products you buy. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, dextrose, and starch are all forms of sugar. So are high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, raw sugar, and honey. And sugar isn't just
in candies and desserts, it's also added to tomato sauce, yogurt, dried fruit,
flavored waters, or granola bars. Since sugar is everywhere,
it's important to understand how it affects the brain. What happens when sugar hits your tongue? And does eating a little bit of sugar
make you crave more? You take a bite of cereal. The sugars it contains activate
the sweet-taste receptors, part of the taste buds on the tongue. These receptors send a signal

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 3: What is the name of the system in the brain that is activated by sugar and other pleasurable experiences? Options: A. The reward system, B. The nervous system, C. The circulatory system, D. The digestive system Correct Option: A**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that mentions the activation of the brain's reward system by sugar.

A more similar question is:

**Question 16 does not match, but Question 11 mentions that sugar "behaves a little bit like a drug" and Question 3 mentions the "reward system". However, Question 11 and Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.**

A more similar question is:

**Question 18: Why is it that people often crave sugary foods? Options: A. Because they are addictive, B. Because they are healthy, C. Because they are rare, D. Because they behave a little bit like drugs Correct Option: D**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more similar question is:

**Question 20: What is the relationship between sugar consumption and dopamine release? Options: A. Sugar consumption leads to a decrease in dopamine release, B. Sugar consumption leads to an increase in dopamine release, C. Sugar consumption has no effect on dopamine release, D. Sugar consumption leads to a decrease in dopamine sensitivity Correct Option: B**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

The most similar question is:

**Question 11 does not match, but Question 3 mentions the "reward system". However, the correct answer is "activates" and it is found in:**

**Question 16 does not match, but in the transcript: "From here, the signal activates the brain's reward system."**

The correct match would be a question that contains "activates" in its options.

Since there isn't an exact match, I will choose the question that best approximates the ground truth MCQ.

**The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 3**

However, please note that this is not an exact match.

If I were to rephrase Question 3 to make it more similar to the ground truth MCQ:

**Question: Sugar ___________ the brain’s reward system. Options: A. Destroys, B. Represses, C. Activates, D. Does nothing to Correct Option: C**

Then, this rephrased question would be the most similar match.

In this case, I will choose the original Question 3 as the most similar match, but please note that the ideal match would be the rephrased question above.

If the generated questions were modified to include the exact wording of the ground truth MCQ, I believe the best match would be the rephrased question above.

However, based on the original questions provided, I will stick with my original answer.

**Transcript**:
Picture warm, gooey cookies, crunchy candies, velvety cakes, waffle cones piled high with ice cream. Is your mouth watering? Are you craving dessert? Why? What happens in the brain
that makes sugary foods so hard to resist? Sugar is a general term
used to describe a class of molecules called carbohydrates, and it's found in a wide variety
of food and drink. Just check the labels
on sweet products you buy. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, dextrose, and starch are all forms of sugar. So are high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, raw sugar, and honey. And sugar isn't just
in candies and desserts, it's also added to tomato sauce, yogurt, dried fruit,
flavored waters, or granola bars. Since sugar is everywhere,
it's important to understand how it affects the brain. What happens when sugar hits your tongue? And does eating a little bit of sugar
make you crave more? You take a bite of cereal. The sugars it contains activate
the sweet-taste receptors, part of the taste buds on the tongue. These receptors send a signal
up to the brain stem, and from there, it forks off
into many areas of the forebrain, one of which is the cerebral cortex. Different sections of the cerebral cortex
process different tastes: bitter, salty, umami, and, in our case, sweet. From here, the signal activates
the brain's reward system. This reward system is a series
of electrical and chemical pathways across several different
regions of the brain. It's a complicated network, but it helps answer a single,
subconscious question: should I do that again? That warm, fuzzy feeling you get
when you taste Grandma's chocolate cake? That's your reward system saying, "Mmm, yes!" And it's not just activated by food. Socializing, sexual behavior, and drugs are just a few examples
of things and experiences that also activate the reward system. But overactivating this reward system
kickstarts a series of unfortunate events: loss of control, craving,
and increased tolerance to sugar. Let's get back to our bite of cereal. It travels down into your stomach
and eventually into your gut. And guess what? There are sugar receptors here, too. They are not taste buds,
but they do send signals telling your brain that you're full or that your body should
produce more insulin to deal with the extra sugar
you're eating. The major currency
of our reward system is dopamine, an important chemical or neurotransmitter. There are many dopamine
receptors in the forebrain, but they're not evenly distributed. Certain areas contain dense
clusters of receptors, and these dopamine hot spots
are a part of our reward system. Drugs like alcohol, nicotine, or heroin send dopamine into overdrive, leading some people
to constantly seek that high, in other words, to be addicted. Sugar also causes dopamine to be released,
though not as violently as drugs. And sugar is rare
among dopamine-inducing foods. Broccoli, for example, has no effect, which probably explains why it's so hard to get
kids to eat their veggies. Speaking of healthy foods, let's say you're hungry
and decide to eat a balanced meal. You do, and dopamine levels spike
in the reward system hot spots. But if you eat that same dish
many days in a row, dopamine levels will spike less and less,
eventually leveling out. That's because when it comes to food, the brain evolved to pay special attention
to new or different tastes. Why? Two reasons: first, to detect food that's gone bad. And second, because the more variety
we have in our diet, the more likely we are
to get all the nutrients we need. To keep that variety up, we need to be able
to recognize a new food, and more importantly, we need
to want to keep eating new foods. And that's why the dopamine levels off
when a food becomes boring. Now, back to that meal. What happens if in place
of the healthy, balanced dish, you eat sugar-rich food instead? If you rarely eat sugar
or don't eat much at a time, the effect is similar
to that of the balanced meal. But if you eat too much,
the dopamine response does not level out. In other words, eating lots of sugar
will continue to feel rewarding. In this way, sugar behaves
a little bit like a drug. It's one reason people seem
to be hooked on sugary foods. So, think back to all those
different kinds of sugar. Each one is unique,
but every time any sugar is consumed, it kickstarts a domino effect in the brain
that sparks a rewarding feeling. Too much, too often,
and things can go into overdrive. So, yes, overconsumption of sugar
can have addictive effects on the brain, but a wedge of cake once
in a while won't hurt you.

**Transcript**:
[Why don't we eat bugs?] For centuries, people have consumed bugs, everything from beetles to caterpillars, locusts, grasshoppers, termites, and dragonflies. The practice even has a name: entomophagy. Early hunter-gatherers
probably learned from animals that foraged for protein-rich insects
and followed suit. As we evolved and bugs
became part of our dietary tradition, they fulfilled the role
of both staple food and delicacy. In ancient Greece, cicadas
were considered luxury snacks. And even the Romans found
beetle larvae to be scrumptious. Why have we lost our taste for bugs? The reason for our rejection
is historical, and the story probably begins around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent, a place in the Middle East that was a major birthplace
of agriculture. Back then, our once-nomadic ancestors
began to settle in the Crescent. And as they learned to farm crops
and domesticate animals there, attitudes changed, rippling outwards towards Europe
and the rest of the Western world. As farming took off, people might have spurned
bugs as mere pests that destroyed their crops. Populations grew,
and the West became urbanized, weakening connections
with our foraging past. People simply forgot
their bug-rich history. Today, for people not
accustomed to entomophagy, bugs are just an irritant. They sting and bite and infest our food. We feel an "ick factor"
associated with them and are disgusted
by the prospect of cooking insects. Almost 2,000 insect species
are turned into food, forming a big part of everyday diets for two billion people around the world. Countries in the tropics
are the keenest consumers, because culturally, it's acceptable. Species in those regions
are also large, diverse, and tend to congregate in groups or swarms that make them easy to harvest. Take Cambodia in Southeast Asia where huge tarantulas are gathered, fried, and sold in the marketplace. In southern Africa, the juicy mopane worm is a dietary staple, simmered in a spicy sauce or eaten dried and salted. And in Mexico, chopped jumiles
are toasted with garlic, lemon, and salt. Bugs can be eaten whole to make up a meal or ground into flour, powder,
and paste to add to food. But it's not all about taste. They're also healthy. In fact, scientists say entomophagy
could be a cost-effective solution for developing countries
that are food insecure. Insects can contain up to 80% protein, the body's vital building blocks, and are also high in energy-rich fat, fiber, and micronutrients
like vitamins and minerals. Did you know that most edible insects
contain the same amount or even more mineral iron than beef, making them a huge, untapped resource
when you consider that iron deficiency is currently the most common
nutritional problem in the world? The mealworm
is another nutritious example. The yellow beetle larvae are native
to America and easy to farm. They have a high vitamin content, loads of healthy minerals, and can contain up to 50% protein, almost as much as in an equivalent
amount of beef. To cook, simply sauté in butter and salt or roast and drizzle with chocolate
for a crunchy snack. What you have to overcome in "ick factor," you gain in nutrition and taste. Indeed, bugs can be delicious. Mealworms taste like roasted nuts. Locusts are similar to shrimp. Crickets, some people say,
have an aroma of popcorn. Farming insects for food
also has less environmental impact than livestock farms do because insects emit
far less greenhouse gas and use up less space, water, and food. Socioeconomically, bug production could uplift people
in developing countries since insect farms can be small scale, highly productive, and yet
relatively inexpensive to keep. Insects can also be turned
into more sustainable food for livestock and can be reared on organic waste, like vegetable peelings, that might otherwise
just end up rotting in landfills. Feeling hungry yet? Faced with a plate of fried crickets,
most people today would still recoil, imagining all those legs and feelers
getting stuck between their teeth. But think of a lobster. It's pretty much just a giant insect
with legs and feelers galore that was once regarded
as an inferior, repulsive food. Now, lobster is a delicacy. Can the same paradigm shift
happen for bugs? So, give it a try! Pop that insect into your mouth, and savor the crunch.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it also deals with the consumption of insects in different parts of the world.

However, a more relevant answer can be provided by noticing that the transcript mentions the following sentence: "Almost 2,000 insect species are turned into food, forming a big part of everyday diets for two billion people around the world." 

If a generated MCQ were to be created based on this sentence, it would be very similar to the ground truth MCQ. But since that is not the case, I must choose the closest one.

A better approach would be to create a new MCQ that directly asks about the number of people consuming insects worldwide, based on the provided transcript.

That being said, if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that none of them are a good match. However, if I really had to pick one, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar in terms of discussing a related topic (insect consumption and nutritional value), although it does not directly address the question of how many people eat bugs worldwide.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4

**Transcript**:
[Why don't we eat bugs?] For centuries, people have consumed bugs, everything from beetles to caterpillars, locusts, grasshoppers, termites, and dragonflies. The practice even has a name: entomophagy. Early hunter-gatherers
probably learned from animals that foraged for protein-rich insects
and followed suit. As we evolved and bugs
became part of our dietary tradition, they fulfilled the role
of both staple food and delicacy. In ancient Greece, cicadas
were considered luxury snacks. And even the Romans found
beetle larvae to be scrumptious. Why have we lost our taste for bugs? The reason for our rejection
is historical, and the story probably begins around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent, a place in the Middle East that was a major birthplace
of agriculture. Back then, our once-nomadic ancestors
began to settle in the Crescent. And as they learned to farm crops
and domesticate animals there, attitudes changed, rippling outwards towards Europe
and the rest of the Western world. As farming took off, people might have spurned
bugs as mere pests that destroyed their crops. Populations grew,
and the West became urbanized, weakening connections
with our foraging past. People simply forgot
their bug-rich history. Today, for people not
accustomed to entomophagy, bugs are just an irritant. They sting and bite and infest our food. We feel an "ick factor"
associated with them and are disgusted
by the prospect of cooking insects. Almost 2,000 insect species
are turned into food, forming a big part of everyday diets for two billion people around the world. Countries in the tropics
are the keenest consumers, because culturally, it's acceptable. Species in those regions
are also large, diverse, and tend to congregate in groups or swarms that make them easy to harvest. Take Cambodia in Southeast Asia where huge tarantulas are gathered, fried, and sold in the marketplace. In southern Africa, the juicy mopane worm is a dietary staple, simmered in a spicy sauce or eaten dried and salted. And in Mexico, chopped jumiles
are toasted with garlic, lemon, and salt. Bugs can be eaten whole to make up a meal or ground into flour, powder,
and paste to add to food. But it's not all about taste. They're also healthy. In fact, scientists say entomophagy
could be a cost-effective solution for developing countries
that are food insecure. Insects can contain up to 80% protein, the body's vital building blocks, and are also high in energy-rich fat, fiber, and micronutrients
like vitamins and minerals. Did you know that most edible insects
contain the same amount or even more mineral iron than beef, making them a huge, untapped resource
when you consider that iron deficiency is currently the most common
nutritional problem in the world? The mealworm
is another nutritious example. The yellow beetle larvae are native
to America and easy to farm. They have a high vitamin content, loads of healthy minerals, and can contain up to 50% protein, almost as much as in an equivalent
amount of beef. To cook, simply sauté in butter and salt or roast and drizzle with chocolate
for a crunchy snack. What you have to overcome in "ick factor," you gain in nutrition and taste. Indeed, bugs can be delicious. Mealworms taste like roasted nuts. Locusts are similar to shrimp. Crickets, some people say,
have an aroma of popcorn. Farming insects for food
also has less environmental impact than livestock farms do because insects emit
far less greenhouse gas and use up less space, water, and food. Socioeconomically, bug production could uplift people
in developing countries since insect farms can be small scale, highly productive, and yet
relatively inexpensive to keep. Insects can also be turned
into more sustainable food for livestock and can be reared on organic waste, like vegetable peelings, that might otherwise
just end up rotting in landfills. Feeling hungry yet? Faced with a plate of fried crickets,
most people today would still recoil, imagining all those legs and feelers
getting stuck between their teeth. But think of a lobster. It's pretty much just a giant insect
with legs and feelers galore that was once regarded
as an inferior, repulsive food. Now, lobster is a delicacy. Can the same paradigm shift
happen for bugs? So, give it a try! Pop that insect into your mouth, and savor the crunch.

None of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one based on the content and intent, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, but it's not a perfect match.

But, if we consider the content of the transcript, we can find that the answer to the ground truth MCQ can be found in the following sentence:
"Countries in the tropics are the keenest consumers, because culturally, it's acceptable."

And a generated MCQ that mentions a specific country in the tropics is:
Question 5: Which country in Southeast Asia is known for its consumption of tarantulas? Options: A. Thailand, B. Cambodia, C. Vietnam, D. Laos Correct Option: B

However, there is another generated MCQ that is more related to the ground truth MCQ:
None of the above questions. But the content of the ground truth MCQ can be found in Question 3, where it mentions that the introduction of livestock farming and agriculture in the Fertile Crescent around 10,000 BC is believed to have contributed to the decline of entomophagy in the Western world, and it also mentions that "attitudes changed, rippling outwards towards Europe and the rest of the Western world." and "Countries in the tropics are the keenest consumers", which is an indication of the part of the world that currently eats insects the most.

However, if I had to choose one of the generated MCQs that is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that it is not explicitly mentioned, but I can choose one that has a similar intent, and that would be:
 Question 3 is the closest in terms of intent, but it does not ask the same question.

However, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, which is:

**Transcript**:
[Why don't we eat bugs?] For centuries, people have consumed bugs, everything from beetles to caterpillars, locusts, grasshoppers, termites, and dragonflies. The practice even has a name: entomophagy. Early hunter-gatherers
probably learned from animals that foraged for protein-rich insects
and followed suit. As we evolved and bugs
became part of our dietary tradition, they fulfilled the role
of both staple food and delicacy. In ancient Greece, cicadas
were considered luxury snacks. And even the Romans found
beetle larvae to be scrumptious. Why have we lost our taste for bugs? The reason for our rejection
is historical, and the story probably begins around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent, a place in the Middle East that was a major birthplace
of agriculture. Back then, our once-nomadic ancestors
began to settle in the Crescent. And as they learned to farm crops
and domesticate animals there, attitudes changed, rippling outwards towards Europe
and the rest of the Western world. As farming took off, people might have spurned
bugs as mere pests that destroyed their crops. Populations grew,
and the West became urbanized, weakening connections
with our foraging past. People simply forgot
their bug-rich history. Today, for people not
accustomed to entomophagy, bugs are just an irritant. They sting and bite and infest our food. We feel an "ick factor"
associated with them and are disgusted
by the prospect of cooking insects. Almost 2,000 insect species
are turned into food, forming a big part of everyday diets for two billion people around the world. Countries in the tropics
are the keenest consumers, because culturally, it's acceptable. Species in those regions
are also large, diverse, and tend to congregate in groups or swarms that make them easy to harvest. Take Cambodia in Southeast Asia where huge tarantulas are gathered, fried, and sold in the marketplace. In southern Africa, the juicy mopane worm is a dietary staple, simmered in a spicy sauce or eaten dried and salted. And in Mexico, chopped jumiles
are toasted with garlic, lemon, and salt. Bugs can be eaten whole to make up a meal or ground into flour, powder,
and paste to add to food. But it's not all about taste. They're also healthy. In fact, scientists say entomophagy
could be a cost-effective solution for developing countries
that are food insecure. Insects can contain up to 80% protein, the body's vital building blocks, and are also high in energy-rich fat, fiber, and micronutrients
like vitamins and minerals. Did you know that most edible insects
contain the same amount or even more mineral iron than beef, making them a huge, untapped resource
when you consider that iron deficiency is currently the most common
nutritional problem in the world? The mealworm
is another nutritious example. The yellow beetle larvae are native
to America and easy to farm. They have a high vitamin content, loads of healthy minerals, and can contain up to 50% protein, almost as much as in an equivalent
amount of beef. To cook, simply sauté in butter and salt or roast and drizzle with chocolate
for a crunchy snack. What you have to overcome in "ick factor," you gain in nutrition and taste. Indeed, bugs can be delicious. Mealworms taste like roasted nuts. Locusts are similar to shrimp. Crickets, some people say,
have an aroma of popcorn. Farming insects for food
also has less environmental impact than livestock farms do because insects emit
far less greenhouse gas and use up less space, water, and food. Socioeconomically, bug production could uplift people
in developing countries since insect farms can be small scale, highly productive, and yet
relatively inexpensive to keep. Insects can also be turned
into more sustainable food for livestock and can be reared on organic waste, like vegetable peelings, that might otherwise
just end up rotting in landfills. Feeling hungry yet? Faced with a plate of fried crickets,
most people today would still recoil, imagining all those legs and feelers
getting stuck between their teeth. But think of a lobster. It's pretty much just a giant insect
with legs and feelers galore that was once regarded
as an inferior, repulsive food. Now, lobster is a delicacy. Can the same paradigm shift
happen for bugs? So, give it a try! Pop that insect into your mouth, and savor the crunch.

**Transcript**:
Looking up at the night sky, we are amazed by how it seems to go on forever. But what will the sky look like billions of years from now? A particular type of scientist, called a cosmologist, spends her time thinking about that very question. The end of the universe is intimately linked to what the universe contains. Over 100 years ago, Einstein developed the Theory of General Relativity, formed of equations that help us understand the relationship between what a universe is made of and its shape. It turns out that the universe could be curved like a ball or sphere. We call this positively curved or closed. Or it could be shaped like a saddle. We call this negatively curved or open. Or it could be flat. And that shape determines how the universe will live and die. We now know that the universe is very close to flat. However, the components of the universe can still affect its eventual fate. We can predict how the universe will change with time if we measure the amounts or energy densities of the various components in the universe today. So, what is the universe made of? The universe contains all the things that we can see, like stars, gas, and planets. We call these things ordinary or baryonic matter. Even though we see them all around us, the total energy density of these components is actually very small, around 5% of the total energy of the universe. So, now let's talk about what the other 95% is. Just under 27% of the rest of the energy density of the universe is made up of what we call dark matter. Dark matter is only very weakly interacting with light, which means it doesn't shine or reflect light in the way that stars and planets do, but, in every other way, it behaves like ordinary matter -- it attracts things gravitationally. In fact, the only way we can detect this dark matter is through this gravitational interaction, how things orbit around it and how it bends light as it curves the space around it. We have yet to discover a dark matter particle, but scientists all over the world are searching for this elusive particle or particles and the effects of dark matter on the universe. But this still doesn't add up to 100%. The remaining 68% of the energy density of the universe is made up of dark energy, which is even more mysterious than dark matter. This dark energy doesn't behave like any other substance we know at all and acts more like anti-gravity force. We say that it has a gravitational pressure, which ordinary matter and dark matter do not. Instead of pulling the universe together, as we would expect gravity to do, the universe appears to be expanding apart at an ever-increasing rate. The leading idea for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant. That means it has the strange property that it expands as the volume of space increases to keep its energy density constant. So, as the universe expands as it is doing right now, there will be more and more dark energy. Dark matter and baryonic matter, on the other hand, don't expand with the universe and become more diluted. Because of this property of the cosmological constant, the future universe will be more and more dominated by dark energy, becoming colder and colder and expanding faster and faster. Eventually, the universe will run out of gas to form stars, and the stars themselves will run out of fuel and burn out, leaving the universe with only black holes in it. Given enough time, even these black holes will evaporate, leaving a universe that is completely cold and empty. That is what we call the heat death of the universe. While it might sound depressing living in a universe that will end its lifetime cold and devoid of life, the end fate of our universe actually has a beautiful symmetry to its hot, fiery beginning. We call the accelerating end state of the universe a de Sitter phase, named after the Dutch mathematician Willem de Sitter. However, we also believe that the universe had another phase of de Sitter expansion in the earliest times of its life. We call this early period inflation, where, shortly after the Big Bang, the universe expanded extremely fast for a brief period. So, the universe will end in much the same state as it began, accelerating. We live at an extraordinary time in the life of the universe where we can start to understand the universe's journey and view a history that plays itself out on the sky for all of us to see.

**Transcript**:
Looking up at the night sky, we are amazed by how it seems to go on forever. But what will the sky look like billions of years from now? A particular type of scientist, called a cosmologist, spends her time thinking about that very question. The end of the universe is intimately linked to what the universe contains. Over 100 years ago, Einstein developed the Theory of General Relativity, formed of equations that help us understand the relationship between what a universe is made of and its shape. It turns out that the universe could be curved like a ball or sphere. We call this positively curved or closed. Or it could be shaped like a saddle. We call this negatively curved or open. Or it could be flat. And that shape determines how the universe will live and die. We now know that the universe is very close to flat. However, the components of the universe can still affect its eventual fate. We can predict how the universe will change with time if we measure the amounts or energy densities of the various components in the universe today. So, what is the universe made of? The universe contains all the things that we can see, like stars, gas, and planets. We call these things ordinary or baryonic matter. Even though we see them all around us, the total energy density of these components is actually very small, around 5% of the total energy of the universe. So, now let's talk about what the other 95% is. Just under 27% of the rest of the energy density of the universe is made up of what we call dark matter. Dark matter is only very weakly interacting with light, which means it doesn't shine or reflect light in the way that stars and planets do, but, in every other way, it behaves like ordinary matter -- it attracts things gravitationally. In fact, the only way we can detect this dark matter is through this gravitational interaction, how things orbit around it and how it bends light as it curves the space around it. We have yet to discover a dark matter particle, but scientists all over the world are searching for this elusive particle or particles and the effects of dark matter on the universe. But this still doesn't add up to 100%. The remaining 68% of the energy density of the universe is made up of dark energy, which is even more mysterious than dark matter. This dark energy doesn't behave like any other substance we know at all and acts more like anti-gravity force. We say that it has a gravitational pressure, which ordinary matter and dark matter do not. Instead of pulling the universe together, as we would expect gravity to do, the universe appears to be expanding apart at an ever-increasing rate. The leading idea for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant. That means it has the strange property that it expands as the volume of space increases to keep its energy density constant. So, as the universe expands as it is doing right now, there will be more and more dark energy. Dark matter and baryonic matter, on the other hand, don't expand with the universe and become more diluted. Because of this property of the cosmological constant, the future universe will be more and more dominated by dark energy, becoming colder and colder and expanding faster and faster. Eventually, the universe will run out of gas to form stars, and the stars themselves will run out of fuel and burn out, leaving the universe with only black holes in it. Given enough time, even these black holes will evaporate, leaving a universe that is completely cold and empty. That is what we call the heat death of the universe. While it might sound depressing living in a universe that will end its lifetime cold and devoid of life, the end fate of our universe actually has a beautiful symmetry to its hot, fiery beginning. We call the accelerating end state of the universe a de Sitter phase, named after the Dutch mathematician Willem de Sitter. However, we also believe that the universe had another phase of de Sitter expansion in the earliest times of its life. We call this early period inflation, where, shortly after the Big Bang, the universe expanded extremely fast for a brief period. So, the universe will end in much the same state as it began, accelerating. We live at an extraordinary time in the life of the universe where we can start to understand the universe's journey and view a history that plays itself out on the sky for all of us to see.

**Transcript**:
We live in a society obsessed with music. We use music to worship, tell stories, to celebrate, to work, exercise, declare our love and sometimes our hatred, and, arguably most importantly, to dance. And, of course, we play music ourselves because, well, it's a pleasant thing to do. Thousands of years ago 
in Ancient Greece, when it came to music, things weren't much different. They might have had lyres and tunics instead of MP3 players and jeans, but the Ancient Greeks 
were just as obsessed with music as we are today. In fact, music was such 
an important part of Ancient Greek society that it makes us seem 
tame by comparison. To really understand just 
how integral music was to the Ancient Greeks, let's begin by acquainting ourselves with a bit of their mythology. In Ancient Greek mythology, it was believed that human creativity was the result of divine inspiration from a group of goddesses 
known as the Muses. While scholars have argued 
over the years that there are anything 
between 3 and 13 Muses, the standard number accepted today is 9. Each Muse oversees her own specific area of artistic expertise, ranging from song and dance to history and astronomy. It might seem strange to categorize history and astronomy 
as creative pursuits, but the Ancient Greeks 
saw these disciplines as more than just school subjects. These were the hallmarks of civilization in what, to their eyes, was a pretty barbaric world. An educated, civilized person was expected to be proficient in all aspects of creative thought inspired by the Muses, and the common medium through which these 
disciplines were taught, studied, and disseminated was music. You see, it's no coincidence that the word Muse is very similar to the word music. It's where the word originates. Poetry, be it a love poem or an epic poem about 
a dragon-slaying hero, was sung with a musical accompaniment. Dancing and singing, obviously, were accompanied by music. Theater was always a combination of spoken word and music. History was recounted through song. Even the study of astronomy was linked to the same physical principles as musical harmony, such as the belief held 
by many Greek thinkers that each of the planets and stars created their own unique sound as they traveled through the cosmos, thrumming like 
an enormous guitar string light-years long. However, music pervaded 
more aspects of their lives than just education. Ancient Greeks considered music to be the basis for understanding the fundamental interconnectedness of all things in the universe. This concept of connectivity is known as harmonia, and it's where we get the word harmony. Music was used as a form of medicine to treat illnesses and physical complaints, as a vital accompaniment 
to sporting contests, and as a means to keep workers in time as they toiled away on 
monotonous or menial tasks. One of the most important applications of music in Ancient Greek society is found in the belief that music can affect a person's ethos. A word we still use today, ethos is a person's guiding beliefs or personal ethics, the way that one behaves towards oneself and others. The Greek philosopher Plato, one of the most famous and influential Greek 
thinkers of the time, asserted that music had a direct effect on a person's ethos. Certain kinds of music could incite a person to violence while others could placate a person into a benign, unthinking stupor. According to Plato, only very specific types of music were beneficial to a person's ethos. One should only listen to music that promotes intelligence, self-discipline, and courage, and all other kinds 
of music must be avoided. Furthermore, Plato fervently denounced any music that deviated from established musical conventions, fearing that doing so would lead to the degradation of the standards of civilization, the corruption of youth, and eventually complete 
and utter anarchy. While Plato's fears can seem extreme, this argument has appeared 
in modern times to condemn musical trends such as jazz or punk or rap. What do you think Plato would say about the music you listen to? Is it beneficial to your ethos, or will it degenerate you into a gibbering, amoral barbarian?

known as the Muses. While scholars have argued 
over the years that there are anything 
between 3 and 13 Muses, the standard number accepted today is 9. Each Muse oversees her own specific area of artistic expertise, ranging from song and dance to history and astronomy. It might seem strange to categorize history and astronomy 
as creative pursuits, but the Ancient Greeks 
saw these disciplines as more than just school subjects. These were the hallmarks of civilization in what, to their eyes, was a pretty barbaric world. An educated, civilized person was expected to be proficient in all aspects of creative thought inspired by the Muses, and the common medium through which these 
disciplines were taught, studied, and disseminated was music. You see, it's no coincidence that the word Muse is very similar to the word music. It's where the word originates. Poetry, be it a love poem or an epic poem about 
a dragon-slaying hero, was sung with a musical accompaniment. Dancing and singing, obviously, were accompanied by music. Theater was always a combination of spoken word and music. History was recounted through song. Even the study of astronomy was linked to the same physical principles as musical harmony, such as the belief held 
by many Greek thinkers that each of the planets and stars created their own unique sound as they traveled through the cosmos, thrumming like 
an enormous guitar string light-years long. However, music pervaded 
more aspects of their lives than just education. Ancient Greeks considered music to be the basis for understanding the fundamental interconnectedness of all things in the universe. This concept of connectivity is known as harmonia, and it's where we get the word harmony. Music was used as a form of medicine to treat illnesses and physical complaints, as a vital accompaniment 
to sporting contests, and as a means to keep workers in time as they toiled away on 
monotonous or menial tasks. One of the most important applications of music in Ancient Greek society is found in the belief that music can affect a person's ethos. A word we still use today, ethos is a person's guiding beliefs or personal ethics, the way that one behaves towards oneself and others. The Greek philosopher Plato, one of the most famous and influential Greek 
thinkers of the time, asserted that music had a direct effect on a person's ethos. Certain kinds of music could incite a person to violence while others could placate a person into a benign, unthinking stupor. According to Plato, only very specific types of music were beneficial to a person's ethos. One should only listen to music that promotes intelligence, self-discipline, and courage, and all other kinds 
of music must be avoided. Furthermore, Plato fervently denounced any music that deviated from established musical conventions, fearing that doing so would lead to the degradation of the standards of civilization, the corruption of youth, and eventually complete 
and utter anarchy. While Plato's fears can seem extreme, this argument has appeared 
in modern times to condemn musical trends such as jazz or punk or rap. What do you think Plato would say about the music you listen to? Is it beneficial to your ethos, or will it degenerate you into a gibbering, amoral barbarian?

We live in a society obsessed with music. We use music to worship, tell stories, to celebrate, to work, exercise, declare our love and sometimes our hatred, and, arguably most importantly, to dance. And, of course, we play music ourselves because, well, it's a pleasant thing to do. Thousands of years ago 
in Ancient Greece, when it came to music, things weren't much different. They might have had lyres and tunics instead of MP3 players and jeans, but the Ancient Greeks

detested pests in the world. In Alaska, swarms
of mosquitos can get so thick that they actually asphyxiate caribou. And mosquito-borne diseases
kill millions of people every year. The scourge
that is the mosquito isn't new. Mosquitoes have been around
for over a hundred million years and over that time have coevolved
with all sorts of species, including our own. There are actually thousands
of species of mosquitos in the world, but they all share one insidious quality: they suck blood, and they're really, really
good at sucking blood. Here's how they do it. After landing, a mosquito will slather some saliva onto the victim's skin,
which works like an antiseptic, numbing the spot so we don't
notice their attack. This is what causes the itchy,
red bumps, by the way. Then the bug will use
its serrated mandibles to carve a little hole in your skin, allowing it to probe around
with its proboscis, searching for a blood vessel. When it hits one,
the lucky parasite can suck two to three times its weight in blood. Turns out we don't really
like that too much. In fact, humans hate mosquitos so much that we spend billions
of dollars worldwide to keep them away from us -- from citronella candles to bug sprays to heavy-duty
agricultural pesticides. But it's not just
that mosquitos are annoying, they're also deadly. Mosquitos can transmit everything
from malaria to yellow fever to West Nile virus to dengue. Over a million people worldwide die every year
from mosquito-borne diseases, and that's just people. Horses, dogs, cats, they can all get diseases
from mosquitoes too. So, if these bugs are so dastardly,
why don't we just get rid of them? We are humans after all, and we're pretty good
at getting rid of species. Well, it's not quite so simple. Getting rid of the mosquito
removes a food source for lots of organisms,
like frogs and fish and birds. Without them,
plants would lose a pollinator. But some scientists say that mosquitos aren't
actually all that important. If we got rid of them, they argue, another species would simply
take their place and we'd probably have far
fewer deaths from malaria. The problem is that nobody
knows what would happen if we killed off all the mosquitos. Something better might take their spot or perhaps something even worse. The question is,
are we willing to take that risk? (Buzzing)

that mosquitos are annoying, they're also deadly. Mosquitos can transmit everything
from malaria to yellow fever to West Nile virus to dengue. Over a million people worldwide die every year
from mosquito-borne diseases, and that's just people. Horses, dogs, cats, they can all get diseases
from mosquitoes too. So, if these bugs are so dastardly,
why don't we just get rid of them? We are humans after all, and we're pretty good
at getting rid of species. Well, it's not quite so simple. Getting rid of the mosquito
removes a food source for lots of organisms,
like frogs and fish and birds. Without them,
plants would lose a pollinator. But some scientists say that mosquitos aren't
actually all that important. If we got rid of them, they argue, another species would simply
take their place and we'd probably have far
fewer deaths from malaria. The problem is that nobody
knows what would happen if we killed off all the mosquitos. Something better might take their spot or perhaps something even worse. The question is,
are we willing to take that risk? (Buzzing)

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Do you ever struggle to find the perfect description when trying to convey an idea? Like a foggy picture, adjectives and modifiers fail to depict what's in your mind. Illustrators often face a similar challenge, especially when attempting to explain complex and difficult concepts. Sometimes the imagery is intangible or way too complicated to explain with a picture. Although complex information could be relayed using charts and stats, this could get pretty boring. Instead, just like when writing an essay to describe, for example, emotions, illustrators can use visual metaphors to bring to life difficult concepts. Just as a written metaphor is a description that relates one object to another, a visual metaphor uses imagery to suggest a particular association or point of similarity. Our lesson "Big Data" is a great example of a situation where visual metaphors played a huge role in explaining the concept. What is Big Data in the first place? Good question! Big Data is a huge amount of digital information produced worldwide on a daily basis, challenging us to find solutions for storing, analyzing, and also imagining it visually. Quite an elusive concept! How should we depict this? Let's take a look at our "Big Data" script. We start with smaller computer servers that branch out into bigger networks to produce data, then even bigger networks and production of even more data. You see where we're going with this -- an object growing and branching out in many directions and producing something as a result? Does that remind you of something? Just like those computer networks, a tree grows and branches out to produce more leaves each year. And every year, just as the data accumulates and faces us with a challenge to find storage solutions, it gets harder to collect those piles of leaves when they fall off the tree. Aha! There's our visual metaphor! Okay, so we have the script, audio, and a visual metaphor. The next step in visual development is to design the characters and environments of the animation. To do so, we think of an appropriate and appealing style to illustrate the ideas and help the viewer better understand what they're hearing. Let's go back to the script and see if we can find any clues there. Our story starts in the 1960s when the first computer networks were built. This decade will serve as a good point to make the stylistic choice for our animation as it will allow us to refer to artwork from that era. You may want to start by looking at some art books (design, illustrations, cartoons, etc.) from that era and find a style that may our own purpose. Look closely, study the material, and try to understand the choices artists of that time made and why. For example, the 1960s minimalist animation style was a significant departure from the cinematic realism that was popular in animated films at the time. The choice to use limited animation techniques was originally made for budgetary reasons, but it became a signature style that influenced many future generations of animators. In this stylistic approach, the simplified characters, flat backgrounds, and angular shapes come together to create new interpretations of reality, which also sounds like a good place to begin visualizing our own Big Data. Well, let's try an experiment. "In the 1980s islands of similar networks speaking different dialects sprung up all over Europe and the States, making remote access possible but tortuous." Is this better? "In the 1980s islands of similar networks speaking different dialects sprung up all over Europe and the States, making remote access possible but tortuous. To make it easy for our physicists across the world to access the ever-expanding Big Data stored at CERN without traveling, the networks needed to be talking with the same language." As you probably observed, graphic representations are a great way to capture the interest of your audience. By depicting what you want to present and explain with strong, memorable visuals, you can communicate your idea more effectively. So, now, challenge yourself. Think of an abstract concept that cannot be explained with simple words. Go ahead and try your hand at visually developing that idea.

**Transcript**:
In a time-lapse video,
it looks like a monster coming alive. For a moment, it sits there innocuously. Then, ripples move across its surface. It bulges outwards,
bursting with weird boils. It triples in volume. Its color darkens ominously,
and its surface hardens into an alien topography
of peaks and craters. Then, the kitchen timer dings. Your cookie is ready. What happened inside that oven? Don't let the apron deceive you! Bakers are mad scientists. When you slide the pan into the oven, you're setting off a series
of chemical reactions that transform one substance, dough,
into another, cookies. When the dough reaches
92 degrees Fahrenheit, the butter inside melts, causing the dough to start spreading out. Butter is an emulsion, or mixture of two substances that don't want to stay together, in this case, water and fat, along with some dairy solids
that help hold them together. As the butter melts,
its trapped water is released. And as the cookie gets hotter,
the water expands into steam. It pushes against the dough
from the inside, trying to escape through the cookie walls like Ridley Scott's chest-bursting alien. Your eggs may have been home
to squirming salmonella bacteria. An estimated 142,000 Americans
are infected this way each year. Though salmonella can live for weeks
outside a living body and even survive freezing, 136 degrees is too hot for them. When your dough reaches
that temperature, they die off. You'll live to test your fate
with a bite of raw dough you sneak from your next batch. At 144 degrees,
changes begin in the proteins, which come mostly
from the eggs in your dough. Eggs are composed of dozens
of different kinds of proteins, each sensitive to a different temperature. In an egg fresh from the hen, these proteins look
like coiled up balls of string. When they're exposed to heat energy, the protein strings unfold
and get tangled up with their neighbors. This linked structure makes the runny egg nearly solid, giving substance to squishy dough. Water boils away at 212 degrees, so like mud baking in the sun, your cookie gets dried out
and it stiffens. Cracks spread across its surface. The steam that was bubbling
inside evaporates, leaving behind airy pockets
that make the cookie light and flaky. Helping this along
is your leavening agent, sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda. The sodium bicarbonate reacts
with acids in the dough to create carbon dioxide gas,
which makes airy pockets in your cookie. Now, it's nearly ready
for a refreshing dunk in a cool glass of milk. One of science's tastiest reactions occurs at 310 degrees. This is the temperature
for Maillard reactions. Maillard reactions result when proteins and sugars break down
and rearrange themselves, forming ring-like structures, which reflect light in a way that gives foods like Thanksgiving turkey and hamburgers their distinctive, rich brown color. As this reaction occurs, it produces a range of flavor
and aroma compounds, which also react with each other, forming even more complex
tastes and smells. Caramelization is the last reaction to take place inside your cookie. Caramelization is what happens when sugar molecules
break down under high heat, forming the sweet, nutty, and slightly bitter flavor compounds
that define, well, caramel. And, in fact, if your recipe
calls for a 350 degree oven, it'll never happen, since caramelization
starts at 356 degrees. If your ideal cookie is barely browned, like a Northeasterner on a beach vacation, you could have set
your oven to 310 degrees. If you like your cookies
to have a nice tan, crank up the heat. Caramelization continues
up to 390 degrees. And here's another trick: you don't need that kitchen timer; your nose is a sensitive
scientific instrument. When you smell the nutty, toasty aromas of the Maillard reaction
and caramelization, your cookies are ready. Grab your glass of milk, put your feet up, and reflect that science
can be pretty sweet.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the first change that occurs in cookie dough after it is put in the oven, while the generated MCQs are all about a completely different topic (the McDonald's coffee case).

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the transcript (baking cookies), I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to generate a new MCQ that is similar to the ground truth MCQ, I can do that. Here is an example:

Question: What is the first change that occurs in cookie dough when it is heated in the oven?
Options: A. Proteins unfold, B. Butter melts, C. Water boils, D. Caramelization occurs
Correct Option: B

This MCQ is similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
In a time-lapse video,
it looks like a monster coming alive. For a moment, it sits there innocuously. Then, ripples move across its surface. It bulges outwards,
bursting with weird boils. It triples in volume. Its color darkens ominously,
and its surface hardens into an alien topography
of peaks and craters. Then, the kitchen timer dings. Your cookie is ready. What happened inside that oven? Don't let the apron deceive you! Bakers are mad scientists. When you slide the pan into the oven, you're setting off a series
of chemical reactions that transform one substance, dough,
into another, cookies. When the dough reaches
92 degrees Fahrenheit, the butter inside melts, causing the dough to start spreading out. Butter is an emulsion, or mixture of two substances that don't want to stay together, in this case, water and fat, along with some dairy solids
that help hold them together. As the butter melts,
its trapped water is released. And as the cookie gets hotter,
the water expands into steam. It pushes against the dough
from the inside, trying to escape through the cookie walls like Ridley Scott's chest-bursting alien. Your eggs may have been home
to squirming salmonella bacteria. An estimated 142,000 Americans
are infected this way each year. Though salmonella can live for weeks
outside a living body and even survive freezing, 136 degrees is too hot for them. When your dough reaches
that temperature, they die off. You'll live to test your fate
with a bite of raw dough you sneak from your next batch. At 144 degrees,
changes begin in the proteins, which come mostly
from the eggs in your dough. Eggs are composed of dozens
of different kinds of proteins, each sensitive to a different temperature. In an egg fresh from the hen, these proteins look
like coiled up balls of string. When they're exposed to heat energy, the protein strings unfold
and get tangled up with their neighbors. This linked structure makes the runny egg nearly solid, giving substance to squishy dough. Water boils away at 212 degrees, so like mud baking in the sun, your cookie gets dried out
and it stiffens. Cracks spread across its surface. The steam that was bubbling
inside evaporates, leaving behind airy pockets
that make the cookie light and flaky. Helping this along
is your leavening agent, sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda. The sodium bicarbonate reacts
with acids in the dough to create carbon dioxide gas,
which makes airy pockets in your cookie. Now, it's nearly ready
for a refreshing dunk in a cool glass of milk. One of science's tastiest reactions occurs at 310 degrees. This is the temperature
for Maillard reactions. Maillard reactions result when proteins and sugars break down
and rearrange themselves, forming ring-like structures, which reflect light in a way that gives foods like Thanksgiving turkey and hamburgers their distinctive, rich brown color. As this reaction occurs, it produces a range of flavor
and aroma compounds, which also react with each other, forming even more complex
tastes and smells. Caramelization is the last reaction to take place inside your cookie. Caramelization is what happens when sugar molecules
break down under high heat, forming the sweet, nutty, and slightly bitter flavor compounds
that define, well, caramel. And, in fact, if your recipe
calls for a 350 degree oven, it'll never happen, since caramelization
starts at 356 degrees. If your ideal cookie is barely browned, like a Northeasterner on a beach vacation, you could have set
your oven to 310 degrees. If you like your cookies
to have a nice tan, crank up the heat. Caramelization continues
up to 390 degrees. And here's another trick: you don't need that kitchen timer; your nose is a sensitive
scientific instrument. When you smell the nutty, toasty aromas of the Maillard reaction
and caramelization, your cookies are ready. Grab your glass of milk, put your feet up, and reflect that science
can be pretty sweet.

Question 31: What was the Options:  Correct Option: None


Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the temperature at which caramelization begins, while the generated MCQs are about a completely different topic (the McDonald's coffee case).

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose an index, I would say -1 or None, as there is no matching generated MCQ.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In a time-lapse video,
it looks like a monster coming alive. For a moment, it sits there innocuously. Then, ripples move across its surface. It bulges outwards,
bursting with weird boils. It triples in volume. Its color darkens ominously,
and its surface hardens into an alien topography
of peaks and craters. Then, the kitchen timer dings. Your cookie is ready. What happened inside that oven? Don't let the apron deceive you! Bakers are mad scientists. When you slide the pan into the oven, you're setting off a series
of chemical reactions that transform one substance, dough,
into another, cookies. When the dough reaches
92 degrees Fahrenheit, the butter inside melts, causing the dough to start spreading out. Butter is an emulsion, or mixture of two substances that don't want to stay together, in this case, water and fat, along with some dairy solids
that help hold them together. As the butter melts,
its trapped water is released. And as the cookie gets hotter,
the water expands into steam. It pushes against the dough
from the inside, trying to escape through the cookie walls like Ridley Scott's chest-bursting alien. Your eggs may have been home
to squirming salmonella bacteria. An estimated 142,000 Americans
are infected this way each year. Though salmonella can live for weeks
outside a living body and even survive freezing, 136 degrees is too hot for them. When your dough reaches
that temperature, they die off. You'll live to test your fate
with a bite of raw dough you sneak from your next batch. At 144 degrees,
changes begin in the proteins, which come mostly
from the eggs in your dough. Eggs are composed of dozens
of different kinds of proteins, each sensitive to a different temperature. In an egg fresh from the hen, these proteins look
like coiled up balls of string. When they're exposed to heat energy, the protein strings unfold
and get tangled up with their neighbors. This linked structure makes the runny egg nearly solid, giving substance to squishy dough. Water boils away at 212 degrees, so like mud baking in the sun, your cookie gets dried out
and it stiffens. Cracks spread across its surface. The steam that was bubbling
inside evaporates, leaving behind airy pockets
that make the cookie light and flaky. Helping this along
is your leavening agent, sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda. The sodium bicarbonate reacts
with acids in the dough to create carbon dioxide gas,
which makes airy pockets in your cookie. Now, it's nearly ready
for a refreshing dunk in a cool glass of milk. One of science's tastiest reactions occurs at 310 degrees. This is the temperature
for Maillard reactions. Maillard reactions result when proteins and sugars break down
and rearrange themselves, forming ring-like structures, which reflect light in a way that gives foods like Thanksgiving turkey and hamburgers their distinctive, rich brown color. As this reaction occurs, it produces a range of flavor
and aroma compounds, which also react with each other, forming even more complex
tastes and smells. Caramelization is the last reaction to take place inside your cookie. Caramelization is what happens when sugar molecules
break down under high heat, forming the sweet, nutty, and slightly bitter flavor compounds
that define, well, caramel. And, in fact, if your recipe
calls for a 350 degree oven, it'll never happen, since caramelization
starts at 356 degrees. If your ideal cookie is barely browned, like a Northeasterner on a beach vacation, you could have set
your oven to 310 degrees. If you like your cookies
to have a nice tan, crank up the heat. Caramelization continues
up to 390 degrees. And here's another trick: you don't need that kitchen timer; your nose is a sensitive
scientific instrument. When you smell the nutty, toasty aromas of the Maillard reaction
and caramelization, your cookies are ready. Grab your glass of milk, put your feet up, and reflect that science
can be pretty sweet.

[Music] in Albuquerque New Mexico an elderly woman was severely burned when she spilled a cup of McDonald's coffee in her lap an 81-year-old woman has been awarded $2.9 million after she sued McDonald's claiming their coffee was too hot Stella lebeck spilled just 8 ounces of coffee but she attracted a flood of attention the jury's award set off a media frenzy and became a rallying cry for those who believed are leg system at run a monck I think it's absurd but as her story cycled through newspaper headlines talk show story lines and late night punch lines one thing was lost the facts this story is the most widely misunderstood story in [Music] America the the public perception of it is Stella leeck won a lottery she bought the coffee she spilled it on herself and now look she's a millionaire when of course the facts are much more complicated than that Stella lebeck was a 79-year-old Widow sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car when she was burned on February 27th 1992 she had recently quit her job as a department store clerk and moved to Albuquerque to be near her daughter the day that the burns happened my mother and my nephew went through the drive-thru at McDonald's and got breakfast and coffee and they pulled into the parking lot and in the Ford Probe there's slanted surfaces everywhere there's no place to put the coffee she put it between her knees and lifted the lid off and in the process of doing that spilled the coffee and all of the hot liquid went into the sweatsuit that she was wearing and pulled in the the seat all I remember was trying to get out of the car I screamed not realizing I was burned that bad I knew I was in terrible pain the severity of the burns caused Stella Lebec to go into shock and her grandson immediately took her to the emergency room she was burned over 16% of her body 6% of the burns were third degree she was in the hospital for a week medical bills were $10,000 so Stella reached out to Donald's and asked to be reimbursed we couldn't believe that this could happen over spilling the coffee so we wrote a letter to McDonald's asking them to check the temperature of the coffee and to give recompense for the medical bills and the response from McDonald's was an offer of $800 Stella lebeck had never sued anyone before Albuquerque attorney Ken Wagner took her case before they went to trial they tried twice to settle out of court but McDonald's refused we bought a product it was used as intended it was unreasonably hot and therefore unreasonably dangerous and those were the essential facts I was not in it for the money I was in it because I want them to bring the temperature down so that people other people will not go through the same thing I did McDonald's policy was to serve coffee between 180 and 90° that's about 30° warmer than most home coffee brewing machines a burn expert testified that liquid at 180° could cause third degree burns within 15 seconds lawyers produced documents that showed that between 1983 and 1992 nearly 700 people claimed that they had been burned by hot coffee at McDonald's McDonald's was on Big Time notice that they had a product that was dangerous and it was burning people we argued that to the jury that they were callous and indifferent in simply not turning down a temperature an expert for McDonald's testified that burns are exceedingly rare one for every 24 million cups of coffee served they just said it's statistically insignificant and we're not going to change what we do people interact with hot beverages all the time in a fast food restaurant and that doesn't necessarily mean that restaurant is doing something wrong attorney Tracy jensx tried the case for McDonald's and argued that Mrs lebeck bore personal responsibility because she spilled the coffee on herself and that McDonald's coffee wasn't any hotter than the coffee at other fast food restaurants she said the reason the coffee was so hot was because that's what customers wanted McDonald's had a really really strong reason for why they brewed their coffee at the temperature they did it was an industrial standard based on the the maximum extraction of the flavor and the maximum holding temperature but the jury saw how liquid at that temperature can scald when they were shown graphic photos of Mrs leck's burned groin the photos depicted where they had to graph the skin from the side of her legs to close the third degree burn and I think if people would have seen the severity of the burns they would have realized it was not a laughing matter after 7 Days of testimony and 4 hours of deliberation jurors came up with a comprehensive answer to a complicated case they unanimously agreed to award Stella $200,000 in compensatory damages but because she caused the spill they reduced that to 160,000 jurors set punitive damages to send the message to McDonald's to turn down the temperature of the coffee I remember I could see Judge Scott going like this with his pencil and I I thought oh I hope he's counting digits on the verdict form and he was they based the amount on the revenue from two days of coffee sales $2.7 million the size of the award got the media's attention but it overshadowed the rest of the story details of the case and the facts related to how the jury made its decision went mostly unreported several days after the verdict I

**Transcript**:
[Music] in Albuquerque New Mexico an elderly woman was severely burned when she spilled a cup of McDonald's coffee in her lap an 81-year-old woman has been awarded $2.9 million after she sued McDonald's claiming their coffee was too hot Stella lebeck spilled just 8 ounces of coffee but she attracted a flood of attention the jury's award set off a media frenzy and became a rallying cry for those who believed are leg system at run a monck I think it's absurd but as her story cycled through newspaper headlines talk show story lines and late night punch lines one thing was lost the facts this story is the most widely misunderstood story in [Music] America the the public perception of it is Stella leeck won a lottery she bought the coffee she spilled it on herself and now look she's a millionaire when of course the facts are much more complicated than that Stella lebeck was a 79-year-old Widow sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car when she was burned on February 27th 1992 she had recently quit her job as a department store clerk and moved to Albuquerque to be near her daughter the day that the burns happened my mother and my nephew went through the drive-thru at McDonald's and got breakfast and coffee and they pulled into the parking lot and in the Ford Probe there's slanted surfaces everywhere there's no place to put the coffee she put it between her knees and lifted the lid off and in the process of doing that spilled the coffee and all of the hot liquid went into the sweatsuit that she was wearing and pulled in the the seat all I remember was trying to get out of the car I screamed not realizing I was burned that bad I knew I was in terrible pain the severity of the burns caused Stella Lebec to go into shock and her grandson immediately took her to the emergency room she was burned over 16% of her body 6% of the burns were third degree she was in the hospital for a week medical bills were $10,000 so Stella reached out to Donald's and asked to be reimbursed we couldn't believe that this could happen over spilling the coffee so we wrote a letter to McDonald's asking them to check the temperature of the coffee and to give recompense for the medical bills and the response from McDonald's was an offer of $800 Stella lebeck had never sued anyone before Albuquerque attorney Ken Wagner took her case before they went to trial they tried twice to settle out of court but McDonald's refused we bought a product it was used as intended it was unreasonably hot and therefore unreasonably dangerous and those were the essential facts I was not in it for the money I was in it because I want them to bring the temperature down so that people other people will not go through the same thing I did McDonald's policy was to serve coffee between 180 and 90° that's about 30° warmer than most home coffee brewing machines a burn expert testified that liquid at 180° could cause third degree burns within 15 seconds lawyers produced documents that showed that between 1983 and 1992 nearly 700 people claimed that they had been burned by hot coffee at McDonald's McDonald's was on Big Time notice that they had a product that was dangerous and it was burning people we argued that to the jury that they were callous and indifferent in simply not turning down a temperature an expert for McDonald's testified that burns are exceedingly rare one for every 24 million cups of coffee served they just said it's statistically insignificant and we're not going to change what we do people interact with hot beverages all the time in a fast food restaurant and that doesn't necessarily mean that restaurant is doing something wrong attorney Tracy jensx tried the case for McDonald's and argued that Mrs lebeck bore personal responsibility because she spilled the coffee on herself and that McDonald's coffee wasn't any hotter than the coffee at other fast food restaurants she said the reason the coffee was so hot was because that's what customers wanted McDonald's had a really really strong reason for why they brewed their coffee at the temperature they did it was an industrial standard based on the the maximum extraction of the flavor and the maximum holding temperature but the jury saw how liquid at that temperature can scald when they were shown graphic photos of Mrs leck's burned groin the photos depicted where they had to graph the skin from the side of her legs to close the third degree burn and I think if people would have seen the severity of the burns they would have realized it was not a laughing matter after 7 Days of testimony and 4 hours of deliberation jurors came up with a comprehensive answer to a complicated case they unanimously agreed to award Stella $200,000 in compensatory damages but because she caused the spill they reduced that to 160,000 jurors set punitive damages to send the message to McDonald's to turn down the temperature of the coffee I remember I could see Judge Scott going like this with his pencil and I I thought oh I hope he's counting digits on the verdict form and he was they based the amount on the revenue from two days of coffee sales $2.7 million the size of the award got the media's attention but it overshadowed the rest of the story details of the case and the facts related to how the jury made its decision went mostly unreported several days after the verdict I had news crews from France Japan Germany my driveway wanting to interview me mean I was stunned after the verdict came in Wednesday August 17th the Albuquerque Journal ran the first story The Associated Press and Reuters wire Services then filed reports and the story was picked up in dozens of newspapers worldwide it became an international news event but as the story's reach got bigger the word count got smaller in some papers who was not more than a blur 697 words in the in the Albuquerque Journal became 3 149 words in the AP and became as few as 48 words in various renderings by

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby In all times and places in our history, human beings have wondered, "Where did we come from? What's our place in the world? What happens to us after we die?" Religions are systems of belief that have developed and evolved over time in response to these and other eternal mysteries, driven by the feeling that some questions can only be answered by faith and based on an intuition that there is something greater than ourselves, a higher power we must answer to, or some source we all spring from and to which we must return. Hinduism means the religions of India. It's not a single religion but rather a variety of related beliefs and spiritual practices. It dates back five millennia to the time of Krishna, a man of such virtue that he became known as an avatar of Vishnu, an incarnation of the god in human form. He taught that all life follows karma, the law of cause and effect, and our job is to do our duty, or dharma, according to our place in society without worrying how things turn out. When we die, we are reincarnated into a new body. If we followed our dharma and did our proper duty in our past life, we get good karma, which sends our soul upward in the social scale. Our rebirth into the next life is thus determined by what we do in this one. The wheel of rebirths is called samsara. It's possible for a very holy person to lead a life with enough good karma to escape the wheel. This escape is called moksha. Hinduism teaches that everything is one. The whole universe is one transcendent reality called Brahman, and there's just one Brahman but many gods within it, and their roles, aspects, and forms differ according to various traditions. Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the preserver who sometimes takes on human form, and Shiva is the transformer, or Lord of the Dance. Durga is the fiercely protective divine mother. Ganesha has an elephant head and is the wise patron of success. Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world. And although most Hindus live in India, they can be found on every continent, one billion strong. Now, let's travel west, across deserts and mountains to the fertile crescent about 4,000 years ago. Judaism began with God calling Abraham and Sarah to leave Mesopotamia and migrate to the land of Canaan. In return for their faith in the one true God, a revolutionary concept in the polytheistic world of that time, they would have land and many descendants. From this promise came the land of Israel and the chosen people, but staying in that land and keeping those people together was going to be very difficult. The Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, but God freed them with the help of the prophet Moses, who received the Ten Commandments and later hundreds more. They conquered the Promised Land, but could only keep it for a few hundred years. Israel sits at a crossroads through which many armies marched over the centuries. And in the year 70, the Romans destroyed the temple in their capital, Jerusalem. So, the religion transformed itself from a temple religion with sacrifices and priests to a religion of the book. Because of this, Judaism is a faith of symbolism, reverence, and deep meanings tied to the literature of its history. The many sacred scriptures make up the Hebrew bible, or Tanakh, and hundreds of written discussions and interpretations are contained in an expansive compendium of deeper meanings, called the Talmud. Jews find rich, symbolic meaning in daily life. At the Passover meal, every item on the menu symbolizes an aspect of the escape from slavery. The importance of growing up is emphasized when young people reach the age of bar and bat mitzvah, ceremonies during which they assume responsibility for their actions and celebrate the weaving of their own lives into the faith, history, and texts of the Jewish people. There are 14 million Jews in the world today, 6 million in Israel, which became independent following the horrors of genocide in World War II, and 5 million in the United States. But now let's go back 2500 years and return to India where Buddhism began with a young prince named Siddhartha. On the night he was conceived, his mother, Queen Maya, is said to have been visited in her sleep by a white elephant who entered her side. Ten months later, Prince Siddartha was born into a life of luxury. Venturing forth from his sheltered existence as a young man, he witnessed the human suffering that had been hidden from him and immediately set out to investigate its sources. Why must people endure suffering? Must we reincarnate through hundreds of lives? At first he thought the problem was attachment to material things, so he gave up his possessions. He became a wandering beggar, which he discovered certainly made him no happier. Then he overheard a music teacher telling a student, "Don't tighten the string too much, it will break. But don't let it go too slack, or it will not sound." In a flash, he realized that looking for answers at the extremes was a mistake. The middle way between luxury and poverty seemed wisest. And while meditating under a bodhi tree, the rest of the answer came to him. All of life abounds with suffering. It's caused by selfish craving for one's own fulfillment at the expense of others. Following an eight-step plan can teach us to reduce that craving, and thus reduce the suffering. On that day, Siddhartha became the Buddha, the enlightened one. Not the only one, but the first one. The Buddhist plan is called the Eightfold Path, and though it is not easy to follow, it has pointed the way for millions to enlightenment, which is what Buddhahood means, a state of compassion, insight, peace, and steadfastness. From the time he got up from under that tree to the moment of his death as an old man, the Buddha taught people how to become enlightened: right speech, right goals, a mind focused on what is real, and a heart focused on loving others. Many Buddhists believe in God or gods, but actions are more important than beliefs. There are nearly a billion Buddhists in the world today, mostly in East, Southeast, and South Asia. 2,000 years ago in Judaism's Promised Land, Christianity was born. Just as Hindus called Krishna "God in Human Form," Christians say the same thing about Jesus, and Christianity grew out of Judaism just as Buddhism grew out of Hinduism. The angel Gabriel was sent by the God of Abraham to ask a young woman named Mary to become the mother of his son. The son was Jesus, raised as a carpenter by Mary and her husband Joseph, until he turned 30, when he began his public career as the living word of God. Less interested in religiousness than in justice and mercy, Jesus healed the sick in order to draw crowds and then taught them about his heavenly father -- affectionate, forgiving, and attentive. Then, he would invite everyone to a common table to illustrate his Kingdom of God, outcasts, sinners, and saints all eating together. He had only three years before his unconventional wisdom got him into trouble. His enemies had him arrested, and he was executed by Rome in the standard means by which rabble-rousers were put to death, crucifixion. But shortly after he was buried, women found his tomb empty and quickly spread word, convinced that he had been raised from the dead. The first Christians described his resurrected appearances, inspiring confidence that his message was true. The message: love one another as I have loved you. Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus in December at Christmas, and his suffering, death, and resurrection during Holy Week in the spring. In the ceremony of baptism, a washing away of sin and welcoming into the Christian community, recall Jesus's own baptism when he left his life as a carpenter. In the rite of Communion, Christians eat the bread and drink the wine blessed as the body and blood of Jesus, recalling Jesus's last supper. There are two billion Christians worldwide, representing almost a third of the world's people. Islam began 1400 years ago with a man of great virtue, meditating in a mountain cave in the Arabian desert. The man was Muhammad. He was visited by a divine messenger, again the angel Gabriel, in Arabic, Jibril, delivering to him the words of Allah, the one God of Abraham. In the next few years, more and more messages came, and he memorized and taught them. The verses he recited were full of wise sayings, beautiful rhymes, and mysterious metaphors. But Muhammad was a merchant, not a poet. Many agreed the verses were indeed the words of God, and these believers became the first Muslims. The word Muslim means one who surrenders, meaning a person who submits to the will of God. A Muslim's five most important duties are called the Five Pillars: Shahada, Muslims declare publicly, there is no other God but Allah, and Muhammad is his final prophet; Salat, they pray five times a day facing Mecca; Zakat, every Muslim is required to give 2 or 3% of their net worth to the poor; Sawm, they fast during daylight hours for the lunar month of Ramadan to strengthen their willpower and their reliance on God; and Hajj, once in a lifetime, every Muslim who is able must make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, rehearsing for the time when they will stand before God to be judged worthy or unworthy of eternal life with Him. The words of God, revealed to the prophet over 23 years, are collected in the Quran, which literally translates into "the recitation." Muslims believe it to be the only holy book free of human corruption. It's also considered by many to be the finest work of literature in the Arabic language. Islam is the world's second largest religion, practiced by over one and a half billion Muslims around the globe. Religion has been an aspect of culture for as long as it has existed, and there are countless variations of its practice. But common to all religions is an appeal for meaning beyond the empty vanities and lowly realities of existence, beyond sin, suffering, and death, beyond fear, and beyond ourselves.

Religions are systems of belief that have developed and evolved over time in response to these and other eternal mysteries, driven by the feeling that some questions can only be answered by faith and based on an intuition that there is something greater than ourselves, a higher power we must answer to, or some source we all spring from and to which we must return.

The son was Jesus, raised as a carpenter by Mary and her husband Joseph, until he turned 30, when he began his public career as the living word of God. Less interested in religiousness than in justice and mercy, Jesus healed the sick in order to draw crowds and then taught them about his heavenly father -- affectionate, forgiving, and attentive. Then, he would invite everyone to a common table to illustrate his Kingdom of God, outcasts, sinners, and saints all eating together. He had only three years before his unconventional wisdom got him into trouble. His enemies had him arrested, and he was executed by Rome in the standard means by which rabble-rousers were put to death, crucifixion. But shortly after he was buried, women found his tomb empty and quickly spread word, convinced that he had been raised from the dead. The first Christians described his resurrected appearances, inspiring confidence that his message was true. The message: love one another as I have loved you. Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus in December at Christmas, and his suffering, death, and resurrection during Holy Week in the spring. In the ceremony of baptism, a washing away of sin and welcoming into the Christian community, recall Jesus's own baptism when he left his life as a carpenter. In the rite of Communion, Christians eat the bread and drink the wine blessed as the body and blood of Jesus, recalling Jesus's last supper. There are two billion Christians worldwide, representing almost a third of the world's people. Islam began 1400 years ago with a man of great virtue, meditating in a mountain cave in the Arabian desert. The man was Muhammad. He was visited by a divine messenger, again the angel Gabriel, in Arabic, Jibril, delivering to him the words of Allah, the one God of Abraham. In the next few years, more and more messages came, and he memorized and taught them. The verses he recited were full of wise sayings, beautiful rhymes, and mysterious metaphors. But Muhammad was a merchant, not a poet. Many agreed the verses were indeed the words of God, and these believers became the first Muslims. The word Muslim means one who surrenders, meaning a person who submits to the will of God. A Muslim's five most important duties are called the Five Pillars: Shahada, Muslims declare publicly, there is no other God but Allah, and Muhammad is his final prophet; Salat, they pray five times a day facing Mecca; Zakat, every Muslim is required to give 2 or 3% of their net worth to the poor; Sawm, they fast during daylight hours for the lunar month of Ramadan to strengthen their willpower and their reliance on God; and Hajj, once in a lifetime, every Muslim who is able must make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, rehearsing for the time when they will stand before God to be judged worthy or unworthy of eternal life with Him. The words of God, revealed to the prophet over 23 years, are collected in the Quran, which literally translates into "the recitation." Muslims believe it to be the only holy book free of human corruption. It's also considered by many to be the finest work of literature in the Arabic language. Islam is the world's second largest religion, practiced by over one and a half billion Muslims around the globe. Religion has been an aspect of culture for as long as it has existed, and there are countless variations of its practice. But common to all religions is an appeal for meaning beyond the empty vanities and lowly realities of existence, beyond sin, suffering, and death, beyond fear, and beyond ourselves.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby In all times and places in our history, human beings have wondered, "Where did we come from? What's our place in the world? What happens to us after we die?" Religions are systems of belief that have developed and evolved over time in response to these and other eternal mysteries, driven by the feeling that some questions can only be answered by faith and based on an intuition that there is something greater than ourselves, a higher power we must answer to, or some source we all spring from and to which we must return. Hinduism means the religions of India. It's not a single religion but rather a variety of related beliefs and spiritual practices. It dates back five millennia to the time of Krishna, a man of such virtue that he became known as an avatar of Vishnu, an incarnation of the god in human form. He taught that all life follows karma, the law of cause and effect, and our job is to do our duty, or dharma, according to our place in society without worrying how things turn out. When we die, we are reincarnated into a new body. If we followed our dharma and did our proper duty in our past life, we get good karma, which sends our soul upward in the social scale. Our rebirth into the next life is thus determined by what we do in this one. The wheel of rebirths is called samsara. It's possible for a very holy person to lead a life with enough good karma to escape the wheel. This escape is called moksha. Hinduism teaches that everything is one. The whole universe is one transcendent reality called Brahman, and there's just one Brahman but many gods within it, and their roles, aspects, and forms differ according to various traditions. Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the preserver who sometimes takes on human form, and Shiva is the transformer, or Lord of the Dance. Durga is the fiercely protective divine mother. Ganesha has an elephant head and is the wise patron of success. Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world. And although most Hindus live in India, they can be found on every continent, one billion strong. Now, let's travel west, across deserts and mountains to the fertile crescent about 4,000 years ago. Judaism began with God calling Abraham and Sarah to leave Mesopotamia and migrate to the land of Canaan. In return for their faith in the one true God, a revolutionary concept in the polytheistic world of that time, they would have land and many descendants. From this promise came the land of Israel and the chosen people, but staying in that land and keeping those people together was going to be very difficult. The Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, but God freed them with the help of the prophet Moses, who received the Ten Commandments and later hundreds more. They conquered the Promised Land, but could only keep it for a few hundred years. Israel sits at a crossroads through which many armies marched over the centuries. And in the year 70, the Romans destroyed the temple in their capital, Jerusalem. So, the religion transformed itself from a temple religion with sacrifices and priests to a religion of the book. Because of this, Judaism is a faith of symbolism, reverence, and deep meanings tied to the literature of its history. The many sacred scriptures make up the Hebrew bible, or Tanakh, and hundreds of written discussions and interpretations are contained in an expansive compendium of deeper meanings, called the Talmud. Jews find rich, symbolic meaning in daily life. At the Passover meal, every item on the menu symbolizes an aspect of the escape from slavery. The importance of growing up is emphasized when young people reach the age of bar and bat mitzvah, ceremonies during which they assume responsibility for their actions and celebrate the weaving of their own lives into the faith, history, and texts of the Jewish people. There are 14 million Jews in the world today, 6 million in Israel, which became independent following the horrors of genocide in World War II, and 5 million in the United States. But now let's go back 2500 years and return to India where Buddhism began with a young prince named Siddhartha. On the night he was conceived, his mother, Queen Maya, is said to have been visited in her sleep by a white elephant who entered her side. Ten months later, Prince Siddartha was born into a life of luxury. Venturing forth from his sheltered existence as a young man, he witnessed the human suffering that had been hidden from him and immediately set out to investigate its sources. Why must people endure suffering? Must we reincarnate through hundreds of lives? At first he thought the problem was attachment to material things, so he gave up his possessions. He became a wandering beggar, which he discovered certainly made him no happier. Then he overheard a music teacher telling a student, "Don't tighten the string too much, it will break. But don't let it go too slack, or it will not sound." In a flash, he realized that looking for answers at the extremes was a mistake. The middle way between luxury and poverty seemed wisest. And while meditating under a bodhi tree, the rest of the answer came to him. All of life abounds with suffering. It's caused by selfish craving for one's own fulfillment at the expense of others. Following an eight-step plan can teach us to reduce that craving, and thus reduce the suffering. On that day, Siddhartha became the Buddha, the enlightened one. Not the only one, but the first one. The Buddhist plan is called the Eightfold Path, and though it is not easy to follow, it has pointed the way for millions to enlightenment, which is what Buddhahood means, a state of compassion, insight, peace, and steadfastness. From the time he got up from under that tree to the moment of his death as an old man, the Buddha taught people how to become enlightened: right speech, right goals, a mind focused on what is real, and a heart focused on loving others. Many Buddhists believe in God or gods, but actions are more important than beliefs. There are nearly a billion Buddhists in the world today, mostly in East, Southeast, and South Asia. 2,000 years ago in Judaism's Promised Land, Christianity was born. Just as Hindus called Krishna "God in Human Form," Christians say the same thing about Jesus, and Christianity grew out of Judaism just as Buddhism grew out of Hinduism. The angel Gabriel was sent by the God of Abraham to ask a young woman named Mary to become the mother of his son. The son was Jesus, raised as a carpenter by Mary and her husband Joseph, until he turned 30, when he began his public career as the living word of God. Less interested in religiousness than in justice and mercy, Jesus healed the sick in order to draw crowds and then taught them about his heavenly father -- affectionate, forgiving, and attentive. Then, he would invite everyone to a common table to illustrate his Kingdom of God, outcasts, sinners, and saints all eating together. He had only three years before his unconventional wisdom got him into trouble. His enemies had him arrested, and he was executed by Rome in the standard means by which rabble-rousers were put to death, crucifixion. But shortly after he was buried, women found his tomb empty and quickly spread word, convinced that he had been raised from the dead. The first Christians described his resurrected appearances, inspiring confidence that his message was true. The message: love one another as I have loved you. Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus in December at Christmas, and his suffering, death, and resurrection during Holy Week in the spring. In the ceremony of baptism, a washing away of sin and welcoming into the Christian community, recall Jesus's own baptism when he left his life as a carpenter. In the rite of Communion, Christians eat the bread and drink the wine blessed as the body and blood of Jesus, recalling Jesus's last supper. There are two billion Christians worldwide, representing almost a third of the world's people. Islam began 1400 years ago with a man of great virtue, meditating in a mountain cave in the Arabian desert. The man was Muhammad. He was visited by a divine messenger, again the angel Gabriel, in Arabic, Jibril, delivering to him the words of Allah, the one God of Abraham.

But Muhammad was a merchant, not a poet. Many agreed the verses were indeed the words of God, and these believers became the first Muslims. The word Muslim means one who surrenders, meaning a person who submits to the will of God. A Muslim's five most important duties are called the Five Pillars: Shahada, Muslims declare publicly, there is no other God but Allah, and Muhammad is his final prophet; Salat, they pray five times a day facing Mecca; Zakat, every Muslim is required to give 2 or 3% of their net worth to the poor; Sawm, they fast during daylight hours for the lunar month of Ramadan to strengthen their willpower and their reliance on God; and Hajj, once in a lifetime, every Muslim who is able must make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, rehearsing for the time when they will stand before God to be judged worthy or unworthy of eternal life with Him. The words of God, revealed to the prophet over 23 years, are collected in the Quran, which literally translates into "the recitation." Muslims believe it to be the only holy book free of human corruption. It's also considered by many to be the finest work of literature in the Arabic language. Islam is the world's second largest religion, practiced by over one and a half billion Muslims around the globe. Religion has been an aspect of culture for as long as it has existed, and there are countless variations of its practice. But common to all religions is an appeal for meaning beyond the empty vanities and lowly realities of existence, beyond sin, suffering, and death, beyond fear, and beyond ourselves.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby In all times and places in our history, human beings have wondered, "Where did we come from? What's our place in the world? What happens to us after we die?" Religions are systems of belief that have developed and evolved over time in response to these and other eternal mysteries, driven by the feeling that some questions can only be answered by faith and based on an intuition that there is something greater than ourselves, a higher power we must answer to, or some source we all spring from and to which we must return. Hinduism means the religions of India. It's not a single religion but rather a variety of related beliefs and spiritual practices. It dates back five millennia to the time of Krishna, a man of such virtue that he became known as an avatar of Vishnu, an incarnation of the god in human form. He taught that all life follows karma, the law of cause and effect, and our job is to do our duty, or dharma, according to our place in society without worrying how things turn out. When we die, we are reincarnated into a new body. If we followed our dharma and did our proper duty in our past life, we get good karma, which sends our soul upward in the social scale. Our rebirth into the next life is thus determined by what we do in this one. The wheel of rebirths is called samsara. It's possible for a very holy person to lead a life with enough good karma to escape the wheel. This escape is called moksha. Hinduism teaches that everything is one. The whole universe is one transcendent reality called Brahman, and there's just one Brahman but many gods within it, and their roles, aspects, and forms differ according to various traditions. Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the preserver who sometimes takes on human form, and Shiva is the transformer, or Lord of the Dance. Durga is the fiercely protective divine mother. Ganesha has an elephant head and is the wise patron of success. Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world. And although most Hindus live in India, they can be found on every continent, one billion strong. Now, let's travel west, across deserts and mountains to the fertile crescent about 4,000 years ago. Judaism began with God calling Abraham and Sarah to leave Mesopotamia and migrate to the land of Canaan. In return for their faith in the one true God, a revolutionary concept in the polytheistic world of that time, they would have land and many descendants. From this promise came the land of Israel and the chosen people, but staying in that land and keeping those people together was going to be very difficult. The Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, but God freed them with the help of the prophet Moses, who received the Ten Commandments and later hundreds more. They conquered the Promised Land, but could only keep it for a few hundred years. Israel sits at a crossroads through which many armies marched over the centuries. And in the year 70, the Romans destroyed the temple in their capital, Jerusalem. So, the religion transformed itself from a temple religion with sacrifices and priests to a religion of the book. Because of this, Judaism is a faith of symbolism, reverence, and deep meanings tied to the literature of its history. The many sacred scriptures make up the Hebrew bible, or Tanakh, and hundreds of written discussions and interpretations are contained in an expansive compendium of deeper meanings, called the Talmud. Jews find rich, symbolic meaning in daily life. At the Passover meal, every item on the menu symbolizes an aspect of the escape from slavery. The importance of growing up is emphasized when young people reach the age of bar and bat mitzvah, ceremonies during which they assume responsibility for their actions and celebrate the weaving of their own lives into the faith, history, and texts of the Jewish people. There are 14 million Jews in the world today, 6 million in Israel, which became independent following the horrors of genocide in World War II, and 5 million in the United States. But now let's go back 2500 years and return to India where Buddhism began with a young prince named Siddhartha. On the night he was conceived, his mother, Queen Maya, is said to have been visited in her sleep by a white elephant who entered her side. Ten months later, Prince Siddartha was born into a life of luxury. Venturing forth from his sheltered existence as a young man, he witnessed the human suffering that had been hidden from him and immediately set out to investigate its sources. Why must people endure suffering? Must we reincarnate through hundreds of lives? At first he thought the problem was attachment to material things, so he gave up his possessions. He became a wandering beggar, which he discovered certainly made him no happier. Then he overheard a music teacher telling a student, "Don't tighten the string too much, it will break. But don't let it go too slack, or it will not sound." In a flash, he realized that looking for answers at the extremes was a mistake. The middle way between luxury and poverty seemed wisest. And while meditating under a bodhi tree, the rest of the answer came to him. All of life abounds with suffering. It's caused by selfish craving for one's own fulfillment at the expense of others. Following an eight-step plan can teach us to reduce that craving, and thus reduce the suffering. On that day, Siddhartha became the Buddha, the enlightened one. Not the only one, but the first one. The Buddhist plan is called the Eightfold Path, and though it is not easy to follow, it has pointed the way for millions to enlightenment, which is what Buddhahood means, a state of compassion, insight, peace, and steadfastness. From the time he got up from under that tree to the moment of his death as an old man, the Buddha taught people how to become enlightened: right speech, right goals, a mind focused on what is real, and a heart focused on loving others. Many Buddhists believe in God or gods, but actions are more important than beliefs. There are nearly a billion Buddhists in the world today, mostly in East, Southeast, and South Asia. 2,000 years ago in Judaism's Promised Land, Christianity was born. Just as Hindus called Krishna "God in Human Form," Christians say the same thing about Jesus, and Christianity grew out of Judaism just as Buddhism grew out of Hinduism. The angel Gabriel was sent by the God of Abraham to ask a young woman named Mary to become the mother of his son. The son was Jesus, raised as a carpenter by Mary and her husband Joseph, until he turned 30, when he began his public career as the living word of God. Less interested in religiousness than in justice and mercy, Jesus healed the sick in order to draw crowds and then taught them about his heavenly father -- affectionate, forgiving, and attentive. Then, he would invite everyone to a common table to illustrate his Kingdom of God, outcasts, sinners, and saints all eating together. He had only three years before his unconventional wisdom got him into trouble. His enemies had him arrested, and he was executed by Rome in the standard means by which rabble-rousers were put to death, crucifixion. But shortly after he was buried, women found his tomb empty and quickly spread word, convinced that he had been raised from the dead. The first Christians described his resurrected appearances, inspiring confidence that his message was true. The message: love one another as I have loved you. Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus in December at Christmas, and his suffering, death, and resurrection during Holy Week in the spring. In the ceremony of baptism, a washing away of sin and welcoming into the Christian community, recall Jesus's own baptism when he left his life as a carpenter. In the rite of Communion, Christians eat the bread and drink the wine blessed as the body and blood of Jesus, recalling Jesus's last supper. There are two billion Christians worldwide, representing almost a third of the world's people. Islam began 1400 years ago with a man of great virtue, meditating in a mountain cave in the Arabian desert. The man was Muhammad. He was visited by a divine messenger, again the angel Gabriel, in Arabic, Jibril, delivering to him the words of Allah, the one God of Abraham. In the next few years, more and more messages came, and he memorized and taught them. The verses he recited were full of wise sayings, beautiful rhymes, and mysterious metaphors. But Muhammad was a merchant, not a poet. Many agreed the verses were indeed the words of God, and these believers became the first Muslims. The word Muslim means one who surrenders, meaning a person who submits to the will of God. A Muslim's five most important duties are called the Five Pillars: Shahada, Muslims declare publicly, there is no other God but Allah, and Muhammad is his final prophet; Salat, they pray five times a day facing Mecca; Zakat, every Muslim is required to give 2 or 3% of their net worth to the poor; Sawm, they fast during daylight hours for the lunar month of Ramadan to strengthen their willpower and their reliance on God; and Hajj, once in a lifetime, every Muslim who is able must make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, rehearsing for the time when they will stand before God to be judged worthy or unworthy of eternal life with Him. The words of God, revealed to the prophet over 23 years, are collected in the Quran, which literally translates into "the recitation." Muslims believe it to be the only holy book free of human corruption. It's also considered by many to be the finest work of literature in the Arabic language. Islam is the world's second largest religion, practiced by over one and a half billion Muslims around the globe. Religion has been an aspect of culture for as long as it has existed, and there are countless variations of its practice. But common to all religions is an appeal for meaning beyond the empty vanities and lowly realities of existence, beyond sin, suffering, and death, beyond fear, and beyond ourselves.

**Transcript**:
Energy is not easy to define. Things have energy, but you can't hold a bushel of energy in your hands. You can see what it does, but you can't see it directly. There are different types of energy, but the differences between them are manifested only in how they make stuff behave. We do know that the total amount of all the different types of energy in the universe is always the same. And, for chemists, two important types of energy are chemical potential energy and kinetic energy. Potential energy is energy waiting to happen. Think of a stretched rubber band. If you cut it, all that potential energy gets converted to kinetic energy, which is registered by you as pain. Like a stretched rubber band, chemical bonds also store energy, and when those bonds are broken, that potential energy gets converted to other types of energy, like heat or light, or gets used to make different bonds. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and molecules are always moving. They're not necessarily going somewhere, though they could be, but they are vibrating, stretching, bending, and/or spinning. Take methane, which is four hydrogens attached to a central carbon, as an example. Drawn on paper, it's just a still tetrahedron. But in real life, it's a jiggling mess. The kinetic energy of molecules is exactly the same type of energy as the energy you have when you're moving around, except that you can be still and molecules can't. If you suck the kinetic energy out of a group of molecules, they'll move less, but they'll never fully stop. Now, in any group of molecules, some will have more kinetic energy than others. And if we calculate the average kinetic energy of the group, we'd have a number mathematically related to temperature. So, the more kinetic energy a group of molecules has, the higher its temperature. And that means that on a hot day, the molecules in the air around you are spinning, stretching, bending, and generally shooting around much faster than on a cold day. Now, hot and cold, by the way, are relative terms. They're always used to compare one thing to something else. So, on that hot summer day, the air molecules have more kinetic energy than the molecules in your skin. So, when those air molecules crash into you, they transfer some of their energy to the molecules in your skin, and you feel that as heat. On a cold day, the air molecules have less kinetic energy than the molecules in your skin, so when you crash into those air molecules, you actually transfer some of your kinetic energy to them, and you feel that as cold. You can trace the path of energy around you. Try it at your next cookout. You burn charcoal and the release of that chemical potential energy shows up as extreme heat and light. The heat then makes the molecules of your burgers, your hot dogs, or your vegetables vibrate until their own bonds break and new chemical structures are formed. Too much heat and you have a charred mess; just enough and you have dinner. Once in your body, the food molecules in your delicious, or charred, dinner get broken down, and the energy released is used to either keep you alive right now or it's stored for later in different molecules. As night falls, the hot summer air cools and the flow of energy into you slows. Then, as the air reaches your skin temperature, for the briefest of moments, the flow stops. And then it starts up again in the opposite direction as energy leaves the warmer surface of your skin to return to the universe around you, that energy, neither created nor destroyed, but ever shape-shifting, the chameleon phoenix of our physical world.

**Transcript**:
Energy is not easy to define. Things have energy, but you can't hold a bushel of energy in your hands. You can see what it does, but you can't see it directly. There are different types of energy, but the differences between them are manifested only in how they make stuff behave. We do know that the total amount of all the different types of energy in the universe is always the same. And, for chemists, two important types of energy are chemical potential energy and kinetic energy. Potential energy is energy waiting to happen. Think of a stretched rubber band. If you cut it, all that potential energy gets converted to kinetic energy, which is registered by you as pain. Like a stretched rubber band, chemical bonds also store energy, and when those bonds are broken, that potential energy gets converted to other types of energy, like heat or light, or gets used to make different bonds. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and molecules are always moving. They're not necessarily going somewhere, though they could be, but they are vibrating, stretching, bending, and/or spinning. Take methane, which is four hydrogens attached to a central carbon, as an example. Drawn on paper, it's just a still tetrahedron. But in real life, it's a jiggling mess. The kinetic energy of molecules is exactly the same type of energy as the energy you have when you're moving around, except that you can be still and molecules can't. If you suck the kinetic energy out of a group of molecules, they'll move less, but they'll never fully stop. Now, in any group of molecules, some will have more kinetic energy than others. And if we calculate the average kinetic energy of the group, we'd have a number mathematically related to temperature. So, the more kinetic energy a group of molecules has, the higher its temperature. And that means that on a hot day, the molecules in the air around you are spinning, stretching, bending, and generally shooting around much faster than on a cold day. Now, hot and cold, by the way, are relative terms. They're always used to compare one thing to something else. So, on that hot summer day, the air molecules have more kinetic energy than the molecules in your skin. So, when those air molecules crash into you, they transfer some of their energy to the molecules in your skin, and you feel that as heat. On a cold day, the air molecules have less kinetic energy than the molecules in your skin, so when you crash into those air molecules, you actually transfer some of your kinetic energy to them, and you feel that as cold. You can trace the path of energy around you. Try it at your next cookout. You burn charcoal and the release of that chemical potential energy shows up as extreme heat and light. The heat then makes the molecules of your burgers, your hot dogs, or your vegetables vibrate until their own bonds break and new chemical structures are formed. Too much heat and you have a charred mess; just enough and you have dinner. Once in your body, the food molecules in your delicious, or charred, dinner get broken down, and the energy released is used to either keep you alive right now or it's stored for later in different molecules. As night falls, the hot summer air cools and the flow of energy into you slows. Then, as the air reaches your skin temperature, for the briefest of moments, the flow stops. And then it starts up again in the opposite direction as energy leaves the warmer surface of your skin to return to the universe around you, that energy, neither created nor destroyed, but ever shape-shifting, the chameleon phoenix of our physical world.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of energy transfer.

The ground truth MCQ is about energy transfer between two objects at different temperatures. The closest generated MCQ is Question 4, which talks about excess fuel in a factory. However, this is not a direct match, as the context and the specific concept of energy transfer between objects at different temperatures are not present in Question 4.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, if you insist on an answer, I would say that Question 4 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Index: 4 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

**Transcript**:
Every chicken was once an egg, every oak tree an acorn, every frog a tadpole. The patch of mold on that old piece of bread in the back of your fridge, not so long ago that was one, solitary cell. Even you were once but a gleam in your parents' eyes. All these organisms share the same basic goal: to perpetuate their own existence. All lifeforms that we've discovered so far stay alive by using basically the same rules, materials, and machinery. Imagine a factory full of robots. These robots have two missions: one, keep the factory running, and two, when the time is right, set up an entirely new factory. To do those things, they need assembly instructions, raw materials, plenty of energy, a few rules about when to work normally, when to work quickly, or when to stop, and some exchange currencies because even robots need to get paid. Each factory has a high security office with blueprints for all the possible factory configurations and complete sets of instructions to make all the different types of robots a factory could ever need. Special robots photocopy these instructions and send them off to help make the building blocks of more robots. Their colleagues assemble those parts into still more robots, which are transported to the right location in the factory and given the tools they need to start working. Every robot draws energy from the central power plant, a giant furnace that can burn regular fuel but also scrap materials if not enough regular fuel is available. Certain zones in the factory have harsher working conditions, so these areas are walled off. But the robots inside can at least communicate with the rest of the factory through specialized portals embedded directly into the walls. And as you've probably figured out, what we're describing here is a cell. The high security office is the nucleus. It stores the blueprints and instructions as deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. The photocopied instructions are RNA. The robots themselves are mostly proteins built from amino acids, but they'll often use special tools that are, or are derived from, vitamins and minerals. The walls between factory zones and around the factory itself are mostly made up of lipids, a.k.a. fats. In most organisms, the primary fuel source are sugars, but in a pinch, fats and proteins can be broken down and burned in the furnace as well. The portals are membrane proteins which allow very specific materials and information to pass through the walls at the right times. Many interactions between robot proteins require some kind of push, think robot minimum wage. A few small but crucial forms of money are transferred between proteins to provide this push. Electrons, protons, oxygen, and phosphate groups are the main chemical currencies, and they're kept in small molecular wallets or larger tote bags to keep them safe. This is biochemistry, the study of how every part of the factory interacts to keep your life running smoothly in the face of extreme challenges. Maybe there's too much fuel; your body will store the excess as glycogen or fat. Maybe there's not enough; your body will use up those energy reserves. Maybe a virus or bacteria tries to invade; your body will mobilize the immune system. Maybe you touched something hot or sharp; your nerves will let you know so you can stop. Maybe it's time to create a new cell or a new person. Amazingly, oak trees, chickens, frogs, and, yes, even you share so many of the same basic robot and factory designs that biochemists can learn a lot about all of them all at the same time.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Every chicken was once an egg, every oak tree an acorn, every frog a tadpole. The patch of mold on that old piece of bread in the back of your fridge, not so long ago that was one, solitary cell. Even you were once but a gleam in your parents' eyes. All these organisms share the same basic goal: to perpetuate their own existence. All lifeforms that we've discovered so far stay alive by using basically the same rules, materials, and machinery. Imagine a factory full of robots. These robots have two missions: one, keep the factory running, and two, when the time is right, set up an entirely new factory. To do those things, they need assembly instructions, raw materials, plenty of energy, a few rules about when to work normally, when to work quickly, or when to stop, and some exchange currencies because even robots need to get paid. Each factory has a high security office with blueprints for all the possible factory configurations and complete sets of instructions to make all the different types of robots a factory could ever need. Special robots photocopy these instructions and send them off to help make the building blocks of more robots. Their colleagues assemble those parts into still more robots, which are transported to the right location in the factory and given the tools they need to start working. Every robot draws energy from the central power plant, a giant furnace that can burn regular fuel but also scrap materials if not enough regular fuel is available. Certain zones in the factory have harsher working conditions, so these areas are walled off. But the robots inside can at least communicate with the rest of the factory through specialized portals embedded directly into the walls. And as you've probably figured out, what we're describing here is a cell. The high security office is the nucleus. It stores the blueprints and instructions as deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. The photocopied instructions are RNA. The robots themselves are mostly proteins built from amino acids, but they'll often use special tools that are, or are derived from, vitamins and minerals. The walls between factory zones and around the factory itself are mostly made up of lipids, a.k.a. fats. In most organisms, the primary fuel source are sugars, but in a pinch, fats and proteins can be broken down and burned in the furnace as well. The portals are membrane proteins which allow very specific materials and information to pass through the walls at the right times. Many interactions between robot proteins require some kind of push, think robot minimum wage. A few small but crucial forms of money are transferred between proteins to provide this push. Electrons, protons, oxygen, and phosphate groups are the main chemical currencies, and they're kept in small molecular wallets or larger tote bags to keep them safe. This is biochemistry, the study of how every part of the factory interacts to keep your life running smoothly in the face of extreme challenges. Maybe there's too much fuel; your body will store the excess as glycogen or fat. Maybe there's not enough; your body will use up those energy reserves. Maybe a virus or bacteria tries to invade; your body will mobilize the immune system. Maybe you touched something hot or sharp; your nerves will let you know so you can stop. Maybe it's time to create a new cell or a new person. Amazingly, oak trees, chickens, frogs, and, yes, even you share so many of the same basic robot and factory designs that biochemists can learn a lot about all of them all at the same time.

**Transcript**:
When the next general election rolls around, who will be eligible to show up at the polls and vote for the President of the United States? It's really pretty simple. If you are at least 18 years old, a citizen of the U.S., and a resident of a state, you can vote, assuming, that is, you are not a felon. Seems about right. After all, the United States prides itself on being a democracy, or a government in which the ultimate authority lies with the citizens of the nation. But it was not always this way. In 1789, George Washington won the electoral college with 100% of the vote, but whose vote was it? Probably not yours. Only 6% of the entire United States population was allowed to vote at all. Voting was a right that only white, male property owners were allowed to exercise. By the 1820s and 1830s, the American population was booming from the east coast into the western frontier. Frontier farmers were resilient, self-reliant, and mostly ineligible to vote because they did not own land. As these new areas of the nation became states, they typically left out the property requirement for voting. Leaders such as Andrew Jackson, the United State's first common man President, promoted what he called universal suffrage. Of course, by universal suffrage, Jackson really meant universal white, male suffrage. All he emphasized was getting rid of the property requirement for voting, not expanding the vote beyond white men. By the 1850s, about 55% of the adult population was eligible to vote in the U.S., much better than 6%, but far from everybody. Then, in 1861, the American Civil War began largely over the issue of slavery and states' rights in the United States. When it was all over, the U.S. ratified the 15th Amendment, which promised that a person's right to vote could not be denied based on race, color, or previous condition as a slave. This meant that black men, newly affirmed as citizens of the U.S., would now be allowed to vote. Of course, laws are far from reality. Despite the promise of the 15th Amendment, intimidation kept African-Americans from exercising their voting rights. States passed laws that limited the rights of African-Americans to vote, including things like literacy tests, which were rigged so that not even literate African-Americans were allowed to pass, and poll taxes. So, despite the 15th Amendment, by 1892, only about 6% of black men in Mississippi were registered to vote. By 1960, it was only 1%. And, of course, women were still totally out of the national voting picture. It wasn't until 1920 that the women's suffrage movement won their 30-year battle, and the 19th Amendment finally gave women the vote, well, white women. The restrictions on African-Americans, including African-American women, remained. After World War II, many Americans began to question the state of U.S. democracy. How could a nation that fought for freedom and human rights abroad come home and deny suffrage based on race? The modern civil rights movement began in the 1940s with those questions in mind. After years of sacrifice, bloodshed, and pain, the United States passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, finally eliminating restrictions such as literacy tests and protecting the voting rights promised under the 15th Amendment to the Constitution. Now, any citizen over the age of 21 could vote. All seemed well until the United States went to war. When the Vietnam War called up all men age 18 and over for the draft, many wondered whether it was fair to send men who couldn't vote to war. In 1971, the 26th Amendment to the Constitution made all citizens 18 and older eligible to vote, the last major expansion of voting rights in the United States. Today, the pool of eligible voters in the U.S. is far broader and more inclusive than ever before in U.S. history. But, of course, it's not perfect. There are still active efforts to suppress some groups from voting, and only about 60% of those who can vote do. Now that you know all the hard work that went into securing the right to vote, what do you think? Do enough citizens have the right to vote now? And among those who can vote, why don't more of them do it?

There are still active efforts to suppress some groups from voting, and only about 60% of those who can vote do. Now that you know all the hard work that went into securing the right to vote, what do you think? Do enough citizens have the right to vote now? And among those who can vote, why don't more of them do it?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Water is the liquid of life. We drink it, we bathe in it, we farm, cook, and clean with it. It's the most abundant molecule in our bodies. In fact, every life form we know of would die without it. But most importantly, without water, we wouldn't have iced tea. Mmmm, iced tea. Why do these ice cubes float? If these were cubes of solid argon in a cup of liquid argon, they would sink. And the same goes for most other substances. But solid water, a.k.a. ice, is somehow less dense than liquid water. How's that possible? You already know that every water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. Let's look at a few of the molecules in a drop of water, and let's say the temperature is 25 degrees Celcius. The molecules are bending, stretching, spinning, and moving through space. Now, let's lower the temperature, which will reduce the amount of kinetic energy each of these molecules has so they'll bend, stretch, spin, and move less. And that means that on average, they'll take up less space. Now, you'd think that as the liquid water starts to freeze, the molecules would just pack together more and more closely, but that's not what happens. Water has a special kind of interaction between molecules that most other substances don't have, and it's called a hydrogen bond. Now, remember that in a covalent bond two electrons are shared, usually unequally, between atoms. In a hydrogen bond, a hydrogen atom is shared, also unequally, between atoms. One hydrogen bond looks like this. Two look like this. Here's three and four and five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, I could go on. In a single drop of water, hydrogen bonds form extended networks between hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, trillions of molecules, and these bonds are constantly breaking and reforming. Now, back to our water as it cools down. Above 4 degrees Celcius, the kinetic energy of the water molecules keeps their interactions with each other short. Hydrogen bonds form and break like high school relationships, that is to say, quickly. But below 4 degrees, the kinetic energy of the water molecules starts to fall below the energy of the hydrogen bonds. So, hydrogen bonds form much more frequently than they break and beautiful structures start to emerge from the chaos. This is what solid water, ice, looks like on the molecular level. Notice that the ordered, hexagonal structure is less dense than the disordered structure of liquid water. And you know that if an object is less dense than the fluid it's in, it will float. So, ice floats on water, so what? Well, let's consider a world without floating ice. The coldest part of the ocean would be the pitch-black ocean floor, once frozen, always frozen. Forget lobster rolls since crustaceans would lose their habitats, or sushi since kelp forests wouldn't grow. What would Canadian kids do in winter without pond hockey or ice fishing? And forget James Cameron's Oscar because the Titanic totally would have made it. Say goodbye to the white polar ice caps reflecting sunlight that would otherwise bake the planet. In fact, forget the oceans as we know them, which at over 70% of the Earth's surface area, regulate the atmosphere of the whole planet. But worst of all, there would be no iced tea. Mmmmm, iced tea.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the most abundant element in our bodies, and the correct answer is Hydrogen. Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 asks about the name of the group of atoms that share electrons covalently with each other, and the correct answer is Molecule. Although this question is not directly related to the most abundant element in our bodies, it is related to the concept of molecules, which is relevant to the topic of water and its composition.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 5, which asks about the number of electrons that a carbon atom can bond with. This question is related to the concept of atomic composition and bonding, which is relevant to the topic of the most abundant element in our bodies.

But, since the transcript mentions that "Water is the liquid of life... It's the most abundant molecule in our bodies", I would say that the question is actually referring to the most abundant molecule, not element. In that case, the correct answer would be Water.

Considering this, I would say that the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not available among the options. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, since it talks about molecules.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the effect of lowering the temperature on the movement of water molecules. The most similar generated MCQ is not directly related to temperature, but it discusses the sharing of electrons in covalent bonding, which is relevant to the molecular structure of water.

However, one of the generated MCQs talks about the movement of atoms in the context of covalent bonding. 

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 3: "In covalent bonding, what happens when one atom doesn't completely overwhelm the other?" Options: A. One atom loses an electron, B. One atom gains an electron, C. They share each other's electrons, D. They don't form a bond Correct Option: C

But since this question doesn't talk about movement or temperature, I will try to find another generated MCQ that is more related to the ground truth MCQ.

One hydrogen bond looks like this. Two look like this. Here's three and four and five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, I could go on. In a single drop of water, hydrogen bonds form extended networks between hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, trillions of molecules, and these bonds are constantly breaking and reforming. Now, back to our water as it cools down. Above 4 degrees Celcius, the kinetic energy of the water molecules keeps their interactions with each other short. Hydrogen bonds form and break like high school relationships, that is to say, quickly. But below 4 degrees, the kinetic energy of the water molecules starts to fall below the energy of the hydrogen bonds. So, hydrogen bonds form much more frequently than they break and beautiful structures start to emerge from the chaos. This is what solid water, ice, looks like on the molecular level. Notice that the ordered, hexagonal structure is less dense than the disordered structure of liquid water. And you know that if an object is less dense than the fluid it's in, it will float. So, ice floats on water, so what? Well, let's consider a world without floating ice. The coldest part of the ocean would be the pitch-black ocean floor, once frozen, always frozen. Forget lobster rolls since crustaceans would lose their habitats, or sushi since kelp forests wouldn't grow. What would Canadian kids do in winter without pond hockey or ice fishing? And forget James Cameron's Oscar because the Titanic totally would have made it. Say goodbye to the white polar ice caps reflecting sunlight that would otherwise bake the planet. In fact, forget the oceans as we know them, which at over 70% of the Earth's surface area, regulate the atmosphere of the whole planet. But worst of all, there would be no iced tea. Mmmmm, iced tea.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 7 does not specifically mention hydrogen bonds, I will continue to look for a better match.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I found that Question 3 is the most relevant to the topic of bonding, but it does not specifically mention hydrogen bonds either.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, as it discusses covalent bonding and the sharing of electrons, which is related to hydrogen bonding.

**Transcript**:
Water is the liquid of life. We drink it, we bathe in it, we farm, cook, and clean with it. It's the most abundant molecule in our bodies. In fact, every life form we know of would die without it. But most importantly, without water, we wouldn't have iced tea. Mmmm, iced tea. Why do these ice cubes float? If these were cubes of solid argon in a cup of liquid argon, they would sink. And the same goes for most other substances. But solid water, a.k.a. ice, is somehow less dense than liquid water. How's that possible? You already know that every water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. Let's look at a few of the molecules in a drop of water, and let's say the temperature is 25 degrees Celcius. The molecules are bending, stretching, spinning, and moving through space. Now, let's lower the temperature, which will reduce the amount of kinetic energy each of these molecules has so they'll bend, stretch, spin, and move less. And that means that on average, they'll take up less space. Now, you'd think that as the liquid water starts to freeze, the molecules would just pack together more and more closely, but that's not what happens. Water has a special kind of interaction between molecules that most other substances don't have, and it's called a hydrogen bond. Now, remember that in a covalent bond two electrons are shared, usually unequally, between atoms. In a hydrogen bond, a hydrogen atom is shared, also unequally, between atoms. One hydrogen bond looks like this. Two look like this. Here's three and four and five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, I could go on.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of "sides" the ice structure has, which is related to the hexagonal structure of ice mentioned in the transcript.

However, among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the most similar in terms of content, as it mentions the arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice, which is related to the hexagonal structure of ice.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

Please note that the similarity is not very high, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the number of sides or the shape of the ice structure.

**Transcript**:
Most atoms don't ride solo, instead they bond with other atoms. And bonds can form between atoms of the same element or atoms of different elements. You've probably imagined bonding as a tug of war. If one atom is really strong, it can pull one or more electrons off another atom. Then you end up with one negatively charged ion and one positively charged ion. And the attraction between these opposite charges is called an ionic bond. This is the kind of sharing where you just give away your toy to someone else and then never get it back. Table salt, sodium chloride, is held together by ionic bonds. Every atom of sodium gives up one electron to every atom of chlorine, ions are formed, and those ions arrange themselves in a 3D grid called a lattice, in which every sodium ion is bonded to six chloride ions, and every chloride ion is bonded to six sodium ions. The chlorine atoms never give the sodium atoms their electrons back. Now, these transactions aren't always so cut-and-dried. If one atom doesn't completely overwhelm the other, they can actually share each other's electrons. This is like a pot luck where you and a friend each bring a dish and then both of you share both dishes. Each atom is attracted to the shared electrons in between them, and this attraction is called a covalent bond. The proteins and DNA in our bodies, for example, are held together largely by these covalent bonds. Some atoms can covalently bond with just one other atom, others with many more. The number of other atoms one atom can bond with depends on how its electrons are arranged. So, how are electrons arranged? Every atom of a pure, unbonded element is electrically neutral because it contains the same number of protons in the nucleus as it does electrons around the nucleus. And not all of those electrons are available for bonding. Only the outermost electrons, the ones in orbitals furthest from the nucleus, the ones with the most energy, only those participate in bonding. By the way, this applies to ionic bonding too. Remember sodium chloride? Well, the electron that sodium loses is the one furthest from its nucleus, and the orbital that electron occupies when it goes over to chlorine is also the one furthest from its nucleus. But back to covalent bonding. Carbon has four electrons that are free to bond, nitrogen has three, oxygen two. So, carbon is likely to form four bonds, nitrogen three, and oxygen two. Hydrogen only has one electron, so it can only form one bond. In some special cases, atoms can form more bonds than you'd expect, but they better have a really good reason to do so, or things tend to fly apart. Groups of atoms that share electrons covalently with each other are called molecules. They can be small. For example, every molecule of oxygen gas is made up of just two oxygen atoms bonded to each other. Or they could be really, really big. Human chromosome 13 is just two molecules, but each one has over 37 billion atoms. And this neighborhood, this city of atoms, is held together by the humble chemical bond.

**Transcript**:
Most atoms don't ride solo, instead they bond with other atoms. And bonds can form between atoms of the same element or atoms of different elements. You've probably imagined bonding as a tug of war. If one atom is really strong, it can pull one or more electrons off another atom. Then you end up with one negatively charged ion and one positively charged ion. And the attraction between these opposite charges is called an ionic bond. This is the kind of sharing where you just give away your toy to someone else and then never get it back. Table salt, sodium chloride, is held together by ionic bonds. Every atom of sodium gives up one electron to every atom of chlorine, ions are formed, and those ions arrange themselves in a 3D grid called a lattice, in which every sodium ion is bonded to six chloride ions, and every chloride ion is bonded to six sodium ions. The chlorine atoms never give the sodium atoms their electrons back. Now, these transactions aren't always so cut-and-dried. If one atom doesn't completely overwhelm the other, they can actually share each other's electrons. This is like a pot luck where you and a friend each bring a dish and then both of you share both dishes. Each atom is attracted to the shared electrons in between them, and this attraction is called a covalent bond. The proteins and DNA in our bodies, for example, are held together largely by these covalent bonds. Some atoms can covalently bond with just one other atom, others with many more. The number of other atoms one atom can bond with depends on how its electrons are arranged. So, how are electrons arranged? Every atom of a pure, unbonded element is electrically neutral because it contains the same number of protons in the nucleus as it does electrons around the nucleus. And not all of those electrons are available for bonding. Only the outermost electrons, the ones in orbitals furthest from the nucleus, the ones with the most energy, only those participate in bonding. By the way, this applies to ionic bonding too. Remember sodium chloride? Well, the electron that sodium loses is the one furthest from its nucleus, and the orbital that electron occupies when it goes over to chlorine is also the one furthest from its nucleus. But back to covalent bonding. Carbon has four electrons that are free to bond, nitrogen has three, oxygen two. So, carbon is likely to form four bonds, nitrogen three, and oxygen two. Hydrogen only has one electron, so it can only form one bond. In some special cases, atoms can form more bonds than you'd expect, but they better have a really good reason to do so, or things tend to fly apart. Groups of atoms that share electrons covalently with each other are called molecules. They can be small. For example, every molecule of oxygen gas is made up of just two oxygen atoms bonded to each other. Or they could be really, really big. Human chromosome 13 is just two molecules, but each one has over 37 billion atoms. And this neighborhood, this city of atoms, is held together by the humble chemical bond.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
There's a prevailing attitude that art doesn't matter in the real world. But the study of art can enhance our perception and our ability to translate to others what we see. Those skills are useful. Those skills can save lives. Doctors, nurses, and law enforcement agents can use painting, sculpture, and photography as tools to improve their visual acuity and communication skills, which are critical during investigations and emergencies. If you're treating an injury, investigating a crime scene, or trying to describe either of those things to a colleague, art can make you better at it. Here, imagine you're a seasoned cop or a dedicated doctor, but also imagine you are at a museum and let's look at a painting. Rene Magritte's "Time Transfixed" of 1938 depicts a mysterious and complex interior that invites analysis not unlike that required of a patient's symptoms or the scene of a crime. A miniature train whose origin and destination are unknown is emerging from a fireplace, and the smoke from the locomotive appears to flow up the chimney as if from the fire that is conspicuously absent below. The eeriness of the scene is echoed in the empty living room, enhanced by wood-grain floors and decorative wall moldings to the right of the fireplace. Perched atop the mantelpiece are two candlesticks and a clock. Behind these objects is a large mirror that reveals an empty interior and only a partial reflection of the objects before it. The juxtaposition of the objects surrounding the moving train raises numerous questions for which there seem to be no apparent answers. Did I summarize the painting accurately or leave any details out? It's no big deal if you see something else in a painting, but what if we're both seasoned cops? I call you for back-up. You show up only to realize the two bank robbing ninjas I'd mentioned were actually six bank robbing ninjas with lasers. Close study of art can train viewers to study thoroughly, analyze the elements observed, articulate them succinctly, and formulate questions to address the seeming inconsistencies. Scrutinizing the details of an unfamiliar scene, in this case the work of art, and accurately conveying any observable contradictions is a critically important skill for both people who look at x-rays and those who interrogate suspects. Let's interrogate this painting, shall we? Okay, Magritte, that's quite a little picture you've painted. But why aren't there any train tracks? Why no fire? What happened to the candles? Why doesn't the fireplace have a little tunnel for the train? It just comes straight through the wall. And the clock says it's about quarter to one, but I'm not sure the light that comes through the window at an angle says it's just past noontime. What's this painting all about, anyway? That's when you, my trusty partner, hold me back, then I leave. You give Magritte a cup of coffee and keep grilling him to see if this painting would hold up in court. Viewers can provide a more detailed and accurate description of a situation by articulating what is seen and what is not seen. This is particularly important in medicine. If an illness is evidenced by three symptoms and only two are present in a patient, a medical professional must explicitly state the absence of that third symptom, signifying that the patient may not have the condition suspected. Articulating the absence of a specific detail or behavior known as the pertinent negative is as critical as stating the details and behaviors that are present in order to treat the patient. And conspicuous absences are only conspicuous to eyes trained to look for them. Art teaches professionals across a wide spectrum of fields not only how to ask more effective questions about what cannot be readily answered, but also, and more importantly, how to analyze complex, real world situations from a new and different perspective, ultimately solving difficult problems. Intense attention to detail, the ability to take a step back and look differently, we want first responders to have the analytical skills of master art historians at least. Art trains us to investigate, and that's a real world skill if there ever was one.

Perched atop the mantelpiece are two candlesticks and a clock. Behind these objects is a large mirror that reveals an empty interior and only a partial reflection of the objects before it. The juxtaposition of the objects surrounding the moving train raises numerous questions for which there seem to be no apparent answers. Did I summarize the painting accurately or leave any details out? It's no big deal if you see something else in a painting, but what if we're both seasoned cops? I call you for back-up. You show up only to realize the two bank robbing ninjas I'd mentioned were actually six bank robbing ninjas with lasers. Close study of art can train viewers to study thoroughly, analyze the elements observed, articulate them succinctly, and formulate questions to address the seeming inconsistencies. Scrutinizing the details of an unfamiliar scene, in this case the work of art, and accurately conveying any observable contradictions is a critically important skill for both people who look at x-rays and those who interrogate suspects. Let's interrogate this painting, shall we? Okay, Magritte, that's quite a little picture you've painted. But why aren't there any train tracks? Why no fire? What happened to the candles? Why doesn't the fireplace have a little tunnel for the train? It just comes straight through the wall. And the clock says it's about quarter to one, but I'm not sure the light that comes through the window at an angle says it's just past noontime. What's this painting all about, anyway? That's when you, my trusty partner, hold me back, then I leave. You give Magritte a cup of coffee and keep grilling him to see if this painting would hold up in court. Viewers can provide a more detailed and accurate description of a situation by articulating what is seen and what is not seen. This is particularly important in medicine. If an illness is evidenced by three symptoms and only two are present in a patient, a medical professional must explicitly state the absence of that third symptom, signifying that the patient may not have the condition suspected. Articulating the absence of a specific detail or behavior known as the pertinent negative is as critical as stating the details and behaviors that are present in order to treat the patient. And conspicuous absences are only conspicuous to eyes trained to look for them. Art teaches professionals across a wide spectrum of fields not only how to ask more effective questions about what cannot be readily answered, but also, and more importantly, how to analyze complex, real world situations from a new and different perspective, ultimately solving difficult problems. Intense attention to detail, the ability to take a step back and look differently, we want first responders to have the analytical skills of master art historians at least. Art trains us to investigate, and that's a real world skill if there ever was one.

**Transcript**:
There's a prevailing attitude that art doesn't matter in the real world. But the study of art can enhance our perception and our ability to translate to others what we see. Those skills are useful. Those skills can save lives. Doctors, nurses, and law enforcement agents can use painting, sculpture, and photography as tools to improve their visual acuity and communication skills, which are critical during investigations and emergencies. If you're treating an injury, investigating a crime scene, or trying to describe either of those things to a colleague, art can make you better at it. Here, imagine you're a seasoned cop or a dedicated doctor, but also imagine you are at a museum and let's look at a painting. Rene Magritte's "Time Transfixed" of 1938 depicts a mysterious and complex interior that invites analysis not unlike that required of a patient's symptoms or the scene of a crime. A miniature train whose origin and destination are unknown is emerging from a fireplace, and the smoke from the locomotive appears to flow up the chimney as if from the fire that is conspicuously absent below. The eeriness of the scene is echoed in the empty living room, enhanced by wood-grain floors and decorative wall moldings to the right of the fireplace. Perched atop the mantelpiece are two candlesticks and a clock. Behind these objects is a large mirror that reveals an empty interior and only a partial reflection of the objects before it. The juxtaposition of the objects surrounding the moving train raises numerous questions for which there seem to be no apparent answers.

**Transcript**:
Many elements of traditional Japanese culture, such as cuisine and martial arts, are well-known throughout the world. Kabuki, a form of classical theater performance, may not be as well understood in the West but has evolved over 400 years to still maintain influence and popularity to this day. The word Kabuki is derived from the Japanese verb kabuku, meaning out of the ordinary or bizarre. Its history began in early 17th century Kyoto, where a shrine maiden named Izumo no Okuni would use the city's dry Kamo Riverbed as a stage to perform unusual dances for passerby, who found her daring parodies of Buddhist prayers both entertaining and mesmerizing. Soon other troops began performing in the same style, and Kabuki made history as Japan's first dramatic performance form catering to the common people. By relying on makeup, or keshou, and facial expressions instead of masks and focusing on historical events and everyday life rather than folk tales, Kabuki set itself apart from the upper-class dance theater form known as Noh and provided a unique commentary on society during the Edo period. At first, the dance was practiced only by females and commonly referred to as Onna-Kabuki. It soon evolved to an ensemble performance and became a regular attraction at tea houses, drawing audiences from all social classes. At this point, Onna-Kabuki was often risque as geishas performed not only to show off their singing and dancing abilities but also to advertise their bodies to potential clients. A ban by the conservative Tokugawa shogunate in 1629 led to the emergence of Wakashu-Kabuki with young boys as actors. But when this was also banned for similar reasons, there was a transition to Yaro-Kabuki, performed by men, necessitating elaborate costumes and makeup for those playing female roles, or onnagata. Attempts by the government to control Kabuki didn't end with bans on the gender or age of performers. The Tokugawa military group, or Bakufu, was fueled by Confucian ideals and often enacted sanctions on costume fabrics, stage weaponry, and the subject matter of the plot. At the same time, Kabuki became closely associated with and influenced by Bunraku, an elaborate form of puppet theater. Due to these influences, the once spontaneous, one-act dance evolved into a structured, five-act play often based on the tenets of Confucian philosophy. Before 1868, when the Tokugawa shogunate fell and Emperor Meiji was restored to power, Japan had practiced isolation from other countries, or Sakoku. And thus, the development of Kabuki had mostly been shaped by domestic influences. But even before this period, European artists, such as Claude Monet, had become interested in and inspired by Japanese art, such as woodblock prints, as well as live performance. After 1868, others such as Vincent van Gogh and composer Claude Debussy began to incorporate Kabuki influences in their work, while Kabuki itself underwent much change and experimentation to adapt to the new modern era. Like other traditional art forms, Kabuki suffered in popularity in the wake of World War II. But innovation by artists such as director Tetsuji Takechi led to a resurgence shortly after. Indeed, Kabuki was even considered a popular form of entertainment amongst American troops stationed in Japan despite initial U.S. censorship of Japanese traditions. Today, Kabuki still lives on as an integral part of Japan's rich cultural heritage, extending its influence beyond the stage to television, film, and anime. The art form pioneered by Okuni continues to delight audiences with the actors' elaborate makeup, extravagant and delicately embroidered costumes, and the unmistakable melodrama of the stories told on stage.

A ban by the conservative Tokugawa shogunate in 1629 led to the emergence of Wakashu-Kabuki with young boys as actors. But when this was also banned for similar reasons, there was a transition to Yaro-Kabuki, performed by men, necessitating elaborate costumes and makeup for those playing female roles, or onnagata. Attempts by the government to control Kabuki didn't end with bans on the gender or age of performers. The Tokugawa military group, or Bakufu, was fueled by Confucian ideals and often enacted sanctions on costume fabrics, stage weaponry, and the subject matter of the plot. At the same time, Kabuki became closely associated with and influenced by Bunraku, an elaborate form of puppet theater. Due to these influences, the once spontaneous, one-act dance evolved into a structured, five-act play often based on the tenets of Confucian philosophy. Before 1868, when the Tokugawa shogunate fell and Emperor Meiji was restored to power, Japan had practiced isolation from other countries, or Sakoku. And thus, the development of Kabuki had mostly been shaped by domestic influences. But even before this period, European artists, such as Claude Monet, had become interested in and inspired by Japanese art, such as woodblock prints, as well as live performance. After 1868, others such as Vincent van Gogh and composer Claude Debussy began to incorporate Kabuki influences in their work, while Kabuki itself underwent much change and experimentation to adapt to the new modern era. Like other traditional art forms, Kabuki suffered in popularity in the wake of World War II. But innovation by artists such as director Tetsuji Takechi led to a resurgence shortly after. Indeed, Kabuki was even considered a popular form of entertainment amongst American troops stationed in Japan despite initial U.S. censorship of Japanese traditions. Today, Kabuki still lives on as an integral part of Japan's rich cultural heritage, extending its influence beyond the stage to television, film, and anime. The art form pioneered by Okuni continues to delight audiences with the actors' elaborate makeup, extravagant and delicately embroidered costumes, and the unmistakable melodrama of the stories told on stage.

**Transcript**:
Many elements of traditional Japanese culture, such as cuisine and martial arts, are well-known throughout the world. Kabuki, a form of classical theater performance, may not be as well understood in the West but has evolved over 400 years to still maintain influence and popularity to this day. The word Kabuki is derived from the Japanese verb kabuku, meaning out of the ordinary or bizarre. Its history began in early 17th century Kyoto, where a shrine maiden named Izumo no Okuni would use the city's dry Kamo Riverbed as a stage to perform unusual dances for passerby, who found her daring parodies of Buddhist prayers both entertaining and mesmerizing. Soon other troops began performing in the same style, and Kabuki made history as Japan's first dramatic performance form catering to the common people. By relying on makeup, or keshou, and facial expressions instead of masks and focusing on historical events and everyday life rather than folk tales, Kabuki set itself apart from the upper-class dance theater form known as Noh and provided a unique commentary on society during the Edo period. At first, the dance was practiced only by females and commonly referred to as Onna-Kabuki. It soon evolved to an ensemble performance and became a regular attraction at tea houses, drawing audiences from all social classes. At this point, Onna-Kabuki was often risque as geishas performed not only to show off their singing and dancing abilities but also to advertise their bodies to potential clients.

**Transcript**:
What if you could only see one color? Imagine, for instance, that you could only see things that were red and that everything else was completely invisible to you. As it turns out, that's how you live your life all the time because your eyes can only see a minuscule part of the full spectrum of light. Different kinds of light are all around you everyday but are invisible to the human eye, from the radio waves that carry your favorite songs, to the x-rays doctors use to see inside of you, to the microwaves that heat up your food. In order to understand how these can all be light, we'll need to know a thing or two about what light is. Light is electromagnetic radiation that acts like both a wave and a particle. Light waves are kind of like waves on the ocean. There are big waves and small waves, waves that crash on the shore one right after the other, and waves that only roll in every so often. The size of a wave is called its wavelength, and how often it comes by is called its frequency. Imagine being a boat in that ocean, bobbing up and down as the waves go by. If the waves that day have long wavelengths, they'll make you bob only so often, or at a low frequency. If the waves, instead, have short wavelengths, they'll be close together, and you'll bob up and down much more often, at a high frequency. Different kinds of light are all waves, they just have different wavelengths and frequencies. If you know the wavelength or frequency of a wave of light, you can also figure out its energy. Long wavelengths have low energies, while short wavelengths have high energies. It's easy to remember if you think about being in that boat. If you were out sailing on a day with short, choppy waves, you'd probably be pretty high energy yourself, running around to keep things from falling over. But on a long wavelength sea, you'd be rolling along, relaxed, low energy. The energy of light tells us how it will interact with matter, for example, the cells of our eyes. When we see, it's because the energy of light stimulates a receptor in our eye called the retina. Our retina are only sensitive to light with a very small range in energy, and so we call that range of light visible light. Inside our retina are special receptors called rods and cones. The rods measure brightness, so we know how much light there is. The cones are in charge of what color of light we see because different cones are sensitive to different energies of light. Some cones are more excited by light that is long wavelength and low energy, and other cones are more excited by short wavelength, high-energy light. When light hits our eye, the relative amount of energy each cone measures signals our brain to perceive colors. The rainbow we perceive is actually visible light in order of its energy. At one side of the rainbow is low-energy light we see as red, and at the other side is high-energy light we see as blue. If light shines on us that has an energy our retina can't measure, we won't be able to see it. Light that is too short wavelength or high energy gets absorbed by the eye's surface before it can even get to the retina, and light that is too long wavelength doesn't have enough energy to stimulate our retina at all. The only thing that makes one kind of light different from another is its wavelength. Radio waves have long wavelengths, while x-rays have short wavelengths. And visible light, the kind you can actually see, is somewhere in between. Even though our eyes can't detect light outside of the visible range, we can build special detectors that are stimulated by these other wavelengths of light, kind of like digital eyes. With these devices, we can measure the light that is there, even though we can't see it ourselves. So, take a step back and think about all of this for a moment. Even though they seem different, the warmth you feel from a crackling fire is the same as the sun shining on you on a beautiful day, the same as ultraviolet light you put on sunscreen to protect yourself from, the same thing as your TV, your radio, and your microwave. Now, those examples are all things here on Earth, things you experience in your everyday life, but here's something even more amazing. Our universe gives off the full spectrum of light, too. When you think of the night sky, you probably think of being able to see the stars shining with your own eyes, but that's just visible light, which you now know is only a tiny part of the full spectrum. If we had to draw the universe and could only use visible light, it would be like having only one crayon -- pretty sad. To see the universe in its full spectrum, we need to have the right eyes, and that means using special telescopes that can help us see beyond visible light. You've probably heard of the Hubble Space Telescope and seen its beautiful pictures taken in visible and ultraviolet light. But you might not know that there are 20 space telescopes in orbit, missions that can each see part of the full spectrum of light. With telescopes acting as our virtual eyes, both in space and here on Earth, we can see some amazing things. And the coolest thing of all, no matter the wavelength or energy, the light that we see out in the distant universe is the same thing as the light that we can experience and study here on Earth. So, since we know the physics of how x-ray, ultraviolet light, or microwaves work here, we can study the light of a distant star or galaxy and know what kinds of things are happening there too. So, as you go about your daily life, think beyond what your eyes can and can't see. Knowing just a little bit about the natural world can help you perceive the full spectrum around you all the time.

Light waves are kind of like waves on the ocean. There are big waves and small waves, waves that crash on the shore one right after the other, and waves that only roll in every so often. The size of a wave is called its wavelength, and how often it comes by is called its frequency. Imagine being a boat in that ocean, bobbing up and down as the waves go by. If the waves that day have long wavelengths, they'll make you bob only so often, or at a low frequency. If the waves, instead, have short wavelengths, they'll be close together, and you'll bob up and down much more often, at a high frequency. Different kinds of light are all waves, they just have different wavelengths and frequencies. If you know the wavelength or frequency of a wave of light, you can also figure out its energy. Long wavelengths have low energies, while short wavelengths have high energies. It's easy to remember if you think about being in that boat. If you were out sailing on a day with short, choppy waves, you'd probably be pretty high energy yourself, running around to keep things from falling over. But on a long wavelength sea, you'd be rolling along, relaxed, low energy. The energy of light tells us how it will interact with matter, for example, the cells of our eyes. When we see, it's because the energy of light stimulates a receptor in our eye called the retina. Our retina are only sensitive to light with a very small range in energy, and so we call that range of light visible light. Inside our retina are special receptors called rods and cones. The rods measure brightness, so we know how much light there is. The cones are in charge of what color of light we see because different cones are sensitive to different energies of light. Some cones are more excited by light that is long wavelength and low energy, and other cones are more excited by short wavelength, high-energy light. When light hits our eye, the relative amount of energy each cone measures signals our brain to perceive colors. The rainbow we perceive is actually visible light in order of its energy. At one side of the rainbow is low-energy light we see as red, and at the other side is high-energy light we see as blue. If light shines on us that has an energy our retina can't measure, we won't be able to see it. Light that is too short wavelength or high energy gets absorbed by the eye's surface before it can even get to the retina, and light that is too long wavelength doesn't have enough energy to stimulate our retina at all. The only thing that makes one kind of light different from another is its wavelength. Radio waves have long wavelengths, while x-rays have short wavelengths. And visible light, the kind you can actually see, is somewhere in between. Even though our eyes can't detect light outside of the visible range, we can build special detectors that are stimulated by these other wavelengths of light, kind of like digital eyes. With these devices, we can measure the light that is there, even though we can't see it ourselves. So, take a step back and think about all of this for a moment. Even though they seem different, the warmth you feel from a crackling fire is the same as the sun shining on you on a beautiful day, the same as ultraviolet light you put on sunscreen to protect yourself from, the same thing as your TV, your radio, and your microwave. Now, those examples are all things here on Earth, things you experience in your everyday life, but here's something even more amazing. Our universe gives off the full spectrum of light, too. When you think of the night sky, you probably think of being able to see the stars shining with your own eyes, but that's just visible light, which you now know is only a tiny part of the full spectrum. If we had to draw the universe and could only use visible light, it would be like having only one crayon -- pretty sad. To see the universe in its full spectrum, we need to have the right eyes, and that means using special telescopes that can help us see beyond visible light. You've probably heard of the Hubble Space Telescope and seen its beautiful pictures taken in visible and ultraviolet light. But you might not know that there are 20 space telescopes in orbit, missions that can each see part of the full spectrum of light. With telescopes acting as our virtual eyes, both in space and here on Earth, we can see some amazing things. And the coolest thing of all, no matter the wavelength or energy, the light that we see out in the distant universe is the same thing as the light that we can experience and study here on Earth. So, since we know the physics of how x-ray, ultraviolet light, or microwaves work here, we can study the light of a distant star or galaxy and know what kinds of things are happening there too. So, as you go about your daily life, think beyond what your eyes can and can't see. Knowing just a little bit about the natural world can help you perceive the full spectrum around you all the time.

**Transcript**:
Today ,more than half of all people in the world live in an urban area. By mid-century, this will increase to 70%. But as recently as 100 years ago, only two out of ten people lived in a city, and before that, it was even less. How have we reached such a high degree of urbanization, and what does it mean for our future? In the earliest days of human history, humans were hunter-gatherers, often moving from place to place in search of food. But about 10,000 years ago, our ancestors began to learn the secrets of selective breeding and early agricultural techniques. For the first time, people could raise food rather than search for it, and this led to the development of semi-permanent villages for the first time in history. "Why only semi-permanent?" you might ask. Well, at first, the villages still had to relocate every few years as the soil became depleted. It was only with the advent of techniques like irrigation and soil tilling about 5,000 years ago that people could rely on a steady and long-term supply of food, making permanent settlements possible. And with the food surpluses that these techniques produced, it was no longer necessary for everyone to farm. This allowed the development of other specialized trades, and, by extension, cities. With cities now producing surplus food, as well as tools, crafts, and other goods, there was now the possibility of commerce and interaction over longer distances. And as trade flourished, so did technologies that facilitated it, like carts, ships, roads, and ports. Of course, these things required even more labor to build and maintain, so more people were drawn from the countryside to the cities as more jobs and opportunities became available. If you think modern cities are overcrowded, you may be surprised to learn that some cities in 2000 B.C. had population densities nearly twice as high as that of Shanghai or Calcutta. One reason for this was that transportation was not widely available, so everything had to be within walking distance, including the few sources of clean water that existed then. And the land area of the city was further restricted by the need for walls to defend against attacks. The Roman Empire was able to develop infrastructure to overcome these limitations, but other than that, modern cities as we know them, didn't really get their start until the Industrial Revolution, when new technology deployed on a mass scale allowed cities to expand and integrate further, establishing police, fire, and sanitation departments, as well as road networks, and later electricity distribution. So, what is the future of cities? Global population is currently more than 7 billion and is predicted to top out around 10 billion. Most of this growth will occur in the urban areas of the world's poorest countries. So, how will cities need to change to accommodate this growth? First, the world will need to seek ways to provide adequate food, sanitation, and education for all people. Second, growth will need to happen in a way that does not damage the land that provides us with the goods and services that support the human population. Food production might move to vertical farms and skyscrapers, rooftop gardens, or vacant lots in city centers, while power will increasingly come from multiple sources of renewable energy. Instead of single-family homes, more residences will be built vertically. We may see buildings that contain everything that people need for their daily life, as well as a smaller, self-sufficient cities focused on local and sustainable production. The future of cities is diverse, malleable, and creative, no longer built around a single industry, but reflecting an increasingly connected and global world.

Today ,more than half of all people in the world live in an urban area. By mid-century, this will increase to 70%. But as recently as 100 years ago, only two out of ten people lived in a city, and before that, it was even less. How have we reached such a high degree of urbanization, and what does it mean for our future? In the earliest days of human history, humans were hunter-gatherers, often moving from place to place in search of food. But about 10,000 years ago, our ancestors began to learn the secrets of selective breeding and early agricultural techniques. For the first time, people could raise food rather than search for it, and this led to the development of semi-permanent villages for the first time in history.

**Transcript**:
Imagine two people are listening to music. What are the odds that they are listening to the exact same playlist? Probably pretty low. After all, everyone has very different tastes in music. Now, what are the odds that your body will need the exact same medical care and treatment as another person's body? Even lower. As we go through our lives, each of us will have very different needs for our own healthcare. Scientists and doctors are constantly researching ways to make medicine more personalized. One way they are doing this is by researching stem cells. Stem cells are cells that are undifferentiated, meaning they do not have a specific job or function. While skin cells protect your body, muscle cells contract, and nerve cells send signals, stem cells do not have any specific structures or functions. Stem cells do have the potential to become all other kinds of cells in your body. Your body uses stem cells to replace worn-out cells when they die. For example, you completely replace the lining of your intestines every four days. Stem cells beneath the lining of your intestines replace these cells as they wear out. Scientists hope that stem cells could be used to create a very special kind of personalized medicine in which we could replace your own body parts with, well, your own body parts. Stem cell researchers are working hard to find ways in which to use stem cells to create new tissue to replace the parts of organs that are damaged by injury or disease. Using stem cells to replace damaged bodily tissue is called regenerative medicine. For example, scientists currently use stem cells to treat patients with blood diseases such as leukemia. Leukemia is a form of cancer that affects your bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside your bones where your blood cells are created. In leukemia, some of the cells inside your bone marrow grow uncontrollably, crowding out the healthy stem cells that form your blood cells. Some leukemia patients can receive a stem cell transplant. These new stem cells will create the blood cells needed by the patient's body. There are actually multiple kinds of stem cells that scientists can use for medical treatments and research. Adult stem cells or tissue-specific stem cells are found in small numbers in most of your body's tissues. Tissue-specific stem cells replace the existing cells in your organs as they wear out and die. Embryonic stem cells are created from leftover embryos that are willingly donated by patients from fertility clinics. Unlike tissue-specific stem cells, embryonic stem cells are pluripotent. This means that they can be grown into any kind of tissue in the body. A third kind of stem cells is called induced pluripotent stem cells. These are regular skin, fat, liver, or other cells that scientists have changed to behave like embryonic stem cells. Like embryonic stem cells, they, too, can become any kind of cell in the body. While scientists and doctors hope to use all of these kinds of stem cells to create new tissue to heal your body, they can also use stem cells to help understand how the body works. Scientists can watch stem cells develop into tissue to understand the mechnanisms that the body uses to create new tissue in a controlled and regulated way. Scientists hope that with more research, they can not only develop specialized medicine that is specific to your body but also better understand how your body functions, both when it's healthy and when it's not.

**Transcript**:
Imagine two people are listening to music. What are the odds that they are listening to the exact same playlist? Probably pretty low. After all, everyone has very different tastes in music. Now, what are the odds that your body will need the exact same medical care and treatment as another person's body? Even lower. As we go through our lives, each of us will have very different needs for our own healthcare. Scientists and doctors are constantly researching ways to make medicine more personalized. One way they are doing this is by researching stem cells. Stem cells are cells that are undifferentiated, meaning they do not have a specific job or function. While skin cells protect your body, muscle cells contract, and nerve cells send signals, stem cells do not have any specific structures or functions. Stem cells do have the potential to become all other kinds of cells in your body. Your body uses stem cells to replace worn-out cells when they die. For example, you completely replace the lining of your intestines every four days. Stem cells beneath the lining of your intestines replace these cells as they wear out. Scientists hope that stem cells could be used to create a very special kind of personalized medicine in which we could replace your own body parts with, well, your own body parts. Stem cell researchers are working hard to find ways in which to use stem cells to create new tissue to replace the parts of organs that are damaged by injury or disease. Using stem cells to replace damaged bodily tissue is called regenerative medicine. For example, scientists currently use stem cells to treat patients with blood diseases such as leukemia. Leukemia is a form of cancer that affects your bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside your bones where your blood cells are created. In leukemia, some of the cells inside your bone marrow grow uncontrollably, crowding out the healthy stem cells that form your blood cells. Some leukemia patients can receive a stem cell transplant. These new stem cells will create the blood cells needed by the patient's body. There are actually multiple kinds of stem cells that scientists can use for medical treatments and research. Adult stem cells or tissue-specific stem cells are found in small numbers in most of your body's tissues. Tissue-specific stem cells replace the existing cells in your organs as they wear out and die. Embryonic stem cells are created from leftover embryos that are willingly donated by patients from fertility clinics. Unlike tissue-specific stem cells, embryonic stem cells are pluripotent. This means that they can be grown into any kind of tissue in the body. A third kind of stem cells is called induced pluripotent stem cells. These are regular skin, fat, liver, or other cells that scientists have changed to behave like embryonic stem cells. Like embryonic stem cells, they, too, can become any kind of cell in the body. While scientists and doctors hope to use all of these kinds of stem cells to create new tissue to heal your body, they can also use stem cells to help understand how the body works. Scientists can watch stem cells develop into tissue to understand the mechnanisms that the body uses to create new tissue in a controlled and regulated way. Scientists hope that with more research, they can not only develop specialized medicine that is specific to your body but also better understand how your body functions, both when it's healthy and when it's not.

100 years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in Exile in his own land and so we've come here today to dramatize the shameful condition inoc since we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check when The Architects of our Republic wrote The Magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence they were signing a promisory note to which every American was to fall out this note was a promise at all men yes black men as well as white men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promisory note in so far as her citizens of color are concerned instead of honoring this sacred obligation America has given the Negro people a bad check a check which has come back marked insufficient f [Applause] but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt we refuse to believe that that are insufficient funds and the great faults of opportunity of this nation so we've come to cash this check a check that will give us upon demand and the riches of freedom and the security of [Applause] Justice we have also come to this h of spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now this is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism now is the time yes it to make real the promises of democracy now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate Valley of segregation to the sunlet path of racial Justice now is the time to lift our nation from the quick Sands of racial Injustice to the solid rock of Brotherhood now is the time now to make Justice a reality for all of God's children it would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment this sweltering Summit of the negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until that is an invigorating aumn of freedom and equality 1963 is not an end but a beginning those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual [Applause] and there will be neither rest nor Tranquility in America until the Negro has granted his citizenship rights the whirlwinds or Revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of Justice emerges but that is something that I must say to my my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the Palace of Justice in the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful Deeds let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for Freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred we must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline we must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence again and again we must rise to the Majestic Heights of meeting physical force with soul Force The Marvelous new militancy which has andul the Negro Community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people for many of our White Brothers as evidenced by their presence here today have come to realize that their Destiny is tied up with our destiny and they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom we cannot walk alone and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always March ahead we cannot turn back there are those who are asking the devotes of civil rights when will you be satisfied we can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the V victim of the Unspeakable Horrors or police brutality we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the [Applause] Cities we cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro basic Mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one we we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by sign stating for whites only we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to [Music] [Applause] vote no no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until Justice rolls down like Waters and righteousness like a mighty [Applause] stream I am not M unmindful that some of you have come here here out of great trials and tribulations some of you have come fresh from narrow a jail sale some of you have come from areas where your quest Quest For Freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by The Winds of police brutality you

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In J.R.R.'s world, Gandalf is one of five wizards
sent by the Valar to guide the inhabitants of Middle Earth in their struggles
against the dark force of Sauron. Gandalf's body was mortal, subject to the physical
rules of Middle Earth, but his spirit was immortal, as seen when he died as Gandalf the Grey and resurrected as Gandalf the White. According to the Wachowski's script, an awakened human only has to link up and hack the neon binary
code of the Matrix to learn how to fly a helicopter
in a matter of seconds. Or if you are the One, or one of the Ones, you don't even need a helicopter,
you just need a cool pair of shades. Cheshire cats can juggle their own heads. iPads are rudimentary. No Quidditch match ends
until the Golden Snitch is caught. And the answer to the ultimate
question of life, the universe, and everything is most certainly 42. Just like real life,
fictional worlds operate consistently within a spectrum of physical
and societal rules. That's what makes these intricate worlds believable, comprehensible,
and worth exploring. In real life, the Law of Gravity
holds seven book sets of "Harry Potter" to millions of bookshelves
around the world. We know this to be true, but we also know that ever since J.K. typed the words wizard, wand, and "Wingardium Leviosa," that Law of Gravity has ceased to exist on the trillions of pages
resting between those bookends. Authors of science fiction and fantasy
literally build worlds. They make rules, maps, lineages, languages, cultures, universes, alternate universes within universes, and from those worlds sprout
story, after story, after story. When it's done well, readers can understand
fictional worlds and their rules just as well as the characters
that live in them do and sometimes, just as well or even better than the reader understands
the world outside of the book. But how? How can human-made squiggles on a page reflect lights into our eyes
that send signals to our brains that we logically and emotionally decode
as complex narratives that move us to fight, cry, sing, and think, that are strong enough not only to hold up a world that is completely invented by the author, but also to change
the reader's perspective on the real world that resumes only when the final squiggle is reached? I'm not sure anyone knows
the answer to that question, yet fantastical, fictional worlds
are created everyday in our minds, on computers, even on napkins at the restaurant
down the street. The truth is your imagination
and a willingness to, figuratively, live in your own world are all you need to get
started writing a novel. I didn't dream up Hogwarts
or the Star Wars' Cantina, but I have written some science thrillers
for kids and young adults. Here are some questions
and methods I've used to help build the worlds
in which those books take place. I start with a basic place and time. Whether that's a fantasy world
or a futuristic setting in the real world, it's important to know where you are
and whether you're working in the past, present, or future. I like to create a timeline showing how the world came to be. What past events have shaped
the way it is now? Then I brainstorm answers to questions that draw out the details
of my fictional world. What rules are in place here? This covers everything
from laws of gravity, or not, to the rules of society and the punishments
for individuals who break them. What kind of government
does this world have? Who has power, and who doesn't? What do people believe in here? And what does this society value most? Then it's time to think
about day-to-day life. What's the weather like in this world? Where do the inhabitants live
and work and go to school? What do they eat and how do they play? How do they treat their young
and their old? What relationships do they have
with the animals and plants of the world? And what do those animals
and plants look like? What kind of technology exists? Transportation? Communication? Access to information? There's so much to think about! So, spend some time living in those tasks
and the answers to those questions, and you're well on your way
to building your own fictional world. Once you know your world
as well as you hope your reader will, set your characters free in it
and see what happens. And ask yourself, "How does this world you created
shape the individuals who live in it? And what kind of conflict
is likely to emerge?" Answer those questions,
and you have your story. Good luck, future world-builder!

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In J.R.R.'s world, Gandalf is one of five wizards
sent by the Valar to guide the inhabitants of Middle Earth in their struggles
against the dark force of Sauron. Gandalf's body was mortal, subject to the physical
rules of Middle Earth, but his spirit was immortal, as seen when he died as Gandalf the Grey and resurrected as Gandalf the White. According to the Wachowski's script, an awakened human only has to link up and hack the neon binary
code of the Matrix to learn how to fly a helicopter
in a matter of seconds. Or if you are the One, or one of the Ones, you don't even need a helicopter,
you just need a cool pair of shades. Cheshire cats can juggle their own heads. iPads are rudimentary. No Quidditch match ends
until the Golden Snitch is caught. And the answer to the ultimate
question of life, the universe, and everything is most certainly 42. Just like real life,
fictional worlds operate consistently within a spectrum of physical
and societal rules. That's what makes these intricate worlds believable, comprehensible,
and worth exploring. In real life, the Law of Gravity
holds seven book sets of "Harry Potter" to millions of bookshelves
around the world. We know this to be true, but we also know that ever since J.K. typed the words wizard, wand, and "Wingardium Leviosa," that Law of Gravity has ceased to exist on the trillions of pages
resting between those bookends. Authors of science fiction and fantasy
literally build worlds. They make rules, maps, lineages, languages, cultures, universes, alternate universes within universes, and from those worlds sprout
story, after story, after story. When it's done well, readers can understand
fictional worlds and their rules just as well as the characters
that live in them do and sometimes, just as well or even better than the reader understands
the world outside of the book. But how? How can human-made squiggles on a page reflect lights into our eyes
that send signals to our brains that we logically and emotionally decode
as complex narratives that move us to fight, cry, sing, and think, that are strong enough not only to hold up a world that is completely invented by the author, but also to change
the reader's perspective on the real world that resumes only when the final squiggle is reached? I'm not sure anyone knows
the answer to that question, yet fantastical, fictional worlds
are created everyday in our minds, on computers, even on napkins at the restaurant
down the street. The truth is your imagination
and a willingness to, figuratively, live in your own world are all you need to get
started writing a novel. I didn't dream up Hogwarts
or the Star Wars' Cantina, but I have written some science thrillers
for kids and young adults. Here are some questions
and methods I've used to help build the worlds
in which those books take place. I start with a basic place and time. Whether that's a fantasy world
or a futuristic setting in the real world, it's important to know where you are
and whether you're working in the past, present, or future. I like to create a timeline showing how the world came to be. What past events have shaped
the way it is now? Then I brainstorm answers to questions that draw out the details
of my fictional world. What rules are in place here? This covers everything
from laws of gravity, or not, to the rules of society and the punishments
for individuals who break them. What kind of government
does this world have? Who has power, and who doesn't? What do people believe in here? And what does this society value most? Then it's time to think
about day-to-day life. What's the weather like in this world? Where do the inhabitants live
and work and go to school? What do they eat and how do they play? How do they treat their young
and their old? What relationships do they have
with the animals and plants of the world? And what do those animals
and plants look like? What kind of technology exists? Transportation? Communication? Access to information? There's so much to think about! So, spend some time living in those tasks
and the answers to those questions, and you're well on your way
to building your own fictional world. Once you know your world
as well as you hope your reader will, set your characters free in it
and see what happens. And ask yourself, "How does this world you created
shape the individuals who live in it? And what kind of conflict
is likely to emerge?" Answer those questions,
and you have your story. Good luck, future world-builder!

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Picture warm, gooey cookies, crunchy candies, velvety cakes, waffle cones piled high with ice cream. Is your mouth watering? Are you craving dessert? Why? What happens in the brain
that makes sugary foods so hard to resist? Sugar is a general term
used to describe a class of molecules called carbohydrates, and it's found in a wide variety
of food and drink. Just check the labels
on sweet products you buy. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, dextrose, and starch are all forms of sugar. So are high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, raw sugar, and honey. And sugar isn't just
in candies and desserts, it's also added to tomato sauce, yogurt, dried fruit,
flavored waters, or granola bars. Since sugar is everywhere,
it's important to understand how it affects the brain. What happens when sugar hits your tongue? And does eating a little bit of sugar
make you crave more? You take a bite of cereal. The sugars it contains activate
the sweet-taste receptors, part of the taste buds on the tongue. These receptors send a signal
up to the brain stem, and from there, it forks off
into many areas of the forebrain, one of which is the cerebral cortex. Different sections of the cerebral cortex
process different tastes: bitter, salty, umami, and, in our case, sweet. From here, the signal activates
the brain's reward system. This reward system is a series
of electrical and chemical pathways across several different
regions of the brain. It's a complicated network, but it helps answer a single,
subconscious question: should I do that again? That warm, fuzzy feeling you get
when you taste Grandma's chocolate cake? That's your reward system saying, "Mmm, yes!" And it's not just activated by food. Socializing, sexual behavior, and drugs are just a few examples
of things and experiences that also activate the reward system. But overactivating this reward system
kickstarts a series of unfortunate events: loss of control, craving,
and increased tolerance to sugar. Let's get back to our bite of cereal. It travels down into your stomach
and eventually into your gut. And guess what? There are sugar receptors here, too. They are not taste buds,
but they do send signals telling your brain that you're full or that your body should
produce more insulin to deal with the extra sugar
you're eating. The major currency
of our reward system is dopamine, an important chemical or neurotransmitter. There are many dopamine
receptors in the forebrain, but they're not evenly distributed. Certain areas contain dense
clusters of receptors, and these dopamine hot spots
are a part of our reward system. Drugs like alcohol, nicotine, or heroin send dopamine into overdrive, leading some people
to constantly seek that high, in other words, to be addicted. Sugar also causes dopamine to be released,
though not as violently as drugs. And sugar is rare
among dopamine-inducing foods. Broccoli, for example, has no effect, which probably explains why it's so hard to get
kids to eat their veggies. Speaking of healthy foods, let's say you're hungry
and decide to eat a balanced meal. You do, and dopamine levels spike
in the reward system hot spots. But if you eat that same dish
many days in a row, dopamine levels will spike less and less,
eventually leveling out. That's because when it comes to food, the brain evolved to pay special attention
to new or different tastes. Why? Two reasons: first, to detect food that's gone bad. And second, because the more variety
we have in our diet, the more likely we are
to get all the nutrients we need. To keep that variety up, we need to be able
to recognize a new food, and more importantly, we need
to want to keep eating new foods. And that's why the dopamine levels off
when a food becomes boring. Now, back to that meal. What happens if in place
of the healthy, balanced dish, you eat sugar-rich food instead? If you rarely eat sugar
or don't eat much at a time, the effect is similar
to that of the balanced meal. But if you eat too much,
the dopamine response does not level out. In other words, eating lots of sugar
will continue to feel rewarding. In this way, sugar behaves
a little bit like a drug. It's one reason people seem
to be hooked on sugary foods. So, think back to all those
different kinds of sugar. Each one is unique,
but every time any sugar is consumed, it kickstarts a domino effect in the brain
that sparks a rewarding feeling. Too much, too often,
and things can go into overdrive. So, yes, overconsumption of sugar
can have addictive effects on the brain, but a wedge of cake once
in a while won't hurt you.

**Transcript**:
Picture warm, gooey cookies, crunchy candies, velvety cakes, waffle cones piled high with ice cream. Is your mouth watering? Are you craving dessert? Why? What happens in the brain
that makes sugary foods so hard to resist? Sugar is a general term
used to describe a class of molecules called carbohydrates, and it's found in a wide variety
of food and drink. Just check the labels
on sweet products you buy. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, dextrose, and starch are all forms of sugar. So are high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, raw sugar, and honey. And sugar isn't just
in candies and desserts, it's also added to tomato sauce, yogurt, dried fruit,
flavored waters, or granola bars. Since sugar is everywhere,
it's important to understand how it affects the brain. What happens when sugar hits your tongue? And does eating a little bit of sugar
make you crave more? You take a bite of cereal. The sugars it contains activate
the sweet-taste receptors, part of the taste buds on the tongue. These receptors send a signal
up to the brain stem, and from there, it forks off
into many areas of the forebrain, one of which is the cerebral cortex. Different sections of the cerebral cortex
process different tastes: bitter, salty, umami, and, in our case, sweet. From here, the signal activates
the brain's reward system. This reward system is a series
of electrical and chemical pathways across several different
regions of the brain. It's a complicated network, but it helps answer a single,
subconscious question: should I do that again? That warm, fuzzy feeling you get
when you taste Grandma's chocolate cake? That's your reward system saying, "Mmm, yes!" And it's not just activated by food. Socializing, sexual behavior, and drugs are just a few examples
of things and experiences that also activate the reward system. But overactivating this reward system
kickstarts a series of unfortunate events: loss of control, craving,
and increased tolerance to sugar. Let's get back to our bite of cereal. It travels down into your stomach
and eventually into your gut. And guess what? There are sugar receptors here, too. They are not taste buds,
but they do send signals telling your brain that you're full or that your body should
produce more insulin to deal with the extra sugar
you're eating. The major currency
of our reward system is dopamine, an important chemical or neurotransmitter. There are many dopamine
receptors in the forebrain, but they're not evenly distributed. Certain areas contain dense
clusters of receptors, and these dopamine hot spots
are a part of our reward system. Drugs like alcohol, nicotine, or heroin send dopamine into overdrive, leading some people
to constantly seek that high, in other words, to be addicted. Sugar also causes dopamine to be released,
though not as violently as drugs. And sugar is rare
among dopamine-inducing foods. Broccoli, for example, has no effect, which probably explains why it's so hard to get
kids to eat their veggies. Speaking of healthy foods, let's say you're hungry
and decide to eat a balanced meal. You do, and dopamine levels spike
in the reward system hot spots. But if you eat that same dish
many days in a row, dopamine levels will spike less and less,
eventually leveling out. That's because when it comes to food, the brain evolved to pay special attention
to new or different tastes. Why? Two reasons: first, to detect food that's gone bad. And second, because the more variety
we have in our diet, the more likely we are
to get all the nutrients we need. To keep that variety up, we need to be able
to recognize a new food, and more importantly, we need
to want to keep eating new foods. And that's why the dopamine levels off
when a food becomes boring. Now, back to that meal. What happens if in place
of the healthy, balanced dish, you eat sugar-rich food instead? If you rarely eat sugar
or don't eat much at a time, the effect is similar
to that of the balanced meal. But if you eat too much,
the dopamine response does not level out. In other words, eating lots of sugar
will continue to feel rewarding. In this way, sugar behaves
a little bit like a drug. It's one reason people seem
to be hooked on sugary foods. So, think back to all those
different kinds of sugar. Each one is unique,
but every time any sugar is consumed, it kickstarts a domino effect in the brain
that sparks a rewarding feeling. Too much, too often,
and things can go into overdrive. So, yes, overconsumption of sugar
can have addictive effects on the brain, but a wedge of cake once
in a while won't hurt you.

**Transcript**:
[Why don't we eat bugs?] For centuries, people have consumed bugs, everything from beetles to caterpillars, locusts, grasshoppers, termites, and dragonflies. The practice even has a name: entomophagy. Early hunter-gatherers
probably learned from animals that foraged for protein-rich insects
and followed suit. As we evolved and bugs
became part of our dietary tradition, they fulfilled the role
of both staple food and delicacy. In ancient Greece, cicadas
were considered luxury snacks. And even the Romans found
beetle larvae to be scrumptious. Why have we lost our taste for bugs? The reason for our rejection
is historical, and the story probably begins around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent, a place in the Middle East that was a major birthplace
of agriculture. Back then, our once-nomadic ancestors
began to settle in the Crescent. And as they learned to farm crops
and domesticate animals there, attitudes changed, rippling outwards towards Europe
and the rest of the Western world. As farming took off, people might have spurned
bugs as mere pests that destroyed their crops. Populations grew,
and the West became urbanized, weakening connections
with our foraging past. People simply forgot
their bug-rich history. Today, for people not
accustomed to entomophagy, bugs are just an irritant. They sting and bite and infest our food. We feel an "ick factor"
associated with them and are disgusted
by the prospect of cooking insects. Almost 2,000 insect species
are turned into food, forming a big part of everyday diets for two billion people around the world. Countries in the tropics
are the keenest consumers, because culturally, it's acceptable. Species in those regions
are also large, diverse, and tend to congregate in groups or swarms that make them easy to harvest. Take Cambodia in Southeast Asia where huge tarantulas are gathered, fried, and sold in the marketplace. In southern Africa, the juicy mopane worm is a dietary staple, simmered in a spicy sauce or eaten dried and salted. And in Mexico, chopped jumiles
are toasted with garlic, lemon, and salt. Bugs can be eaten whole to make up a meal or ground into flour, powder,
and paste to add to food. But it's not all about taste. They're also healthy. In fact, scientists say entomophagy
could be a cost-effective solution for developing countries
that are food insecure. Insects can contain up to 80% protein, the body's vital building blocks, and are also high in energy-rich fat, fiber, and micronutrients
like vitamins and minerals. Did you know that most edible insects
contain the same amount or even more mineral iron than beef, making them a huge, untapped resource
when you consider that iron deficiency is currently the most common
nutritional problem in the world? The mealworm
is another nutritious example. The yellow beetle larvae are native
to America and easy to farm. They have a high vitamin content, loads of healthy minerals, and can contain up to 50% protein, almost as much as in an equivalent
amount of beef. To cook, simply sauté in butter and salt or roast and drizzle with chocolate
for a crunchy snack. What you have to overcome in "ick factor," you gain in nutrition and taste. Indeed, bugs can be delicious. Mealworms taste like roasted nuts. Locusts are similar to shrimp. Crickets, some people say,
have an aroma of popcorn. Farming insects for food
also has less environmental impact than livestock farms do because insects emit
far less greenhouse gas and use up less space, water, and food. Socioeconomically, bug production could uplift people
in developing countries since insect farms can be small scale, highly productive, and yet
relatively inexpensive to keep. Insects can also be turned
into more sustainable food for livestock and can be reared on organic waste, like vegetable peelings, that might otherwise
just end up rotting in landfills. Feeling hungry yet? Faced with a plate of fried crickets,
most people today would still recoil, imagining all those legs and feelers
getting stuck between their teeth. But think of a lobster. It's pretty much just a giant insect
with legs and feelers galore that was once regarded
as an inferior, repulsive food. Now, lobster is a delicacy. Can the same paradigm shift
happen for bugs? So, give it a try! Pop that insect into your mouth, and savor the crunch.

**Transcript**:
[Why don't we eat bugs?] For centuries, people have consumed bugs, everything from beetles to caterpillars, locusts, grasshoppers, termites, and dragonflies. The practice even has a name: entomophagy. Early hunter-gatherers
probably learned from animals that foraged for protein-rich insects
and followed suit. As we evolved and bugs
became part of our dietary tradition, they fulfilled the role
of both staple food and delicacy. In ancient Greece, cicadas
were considered luxury snacks. And even the Romans found
beetle larvae to be scrumptious. Why have we lost our taste for bugs? The reason for our rejection
is historical, and the story probably begins around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent, a place in the Middle East that was a major birthplace
of agriculture. Back then, our once-nomadic ancestors
began to settle in the Crescent. And as they learned to farm crops
and domesticate animals there, attitudes changed, rippling outwards towards Europe
and the rest of the Western world. As farming took off, people might have spurned
bugs as mere pests that destroyed their crops. Populations grew,
and the West became urbanized, weakening connections
with our foraging past. People simply forgot
their bug-rich history. Today, for people not
accustomed to entomophagy, bugs are just an irritant. They sting and bite and infest our food. We feel an "ick factor"
associated with them and are disgusted
by the prospect of cooking insects. Almost 2,000 insect species
are turned into food, forming a big part of everyday diets for two billion people around the world. Countries in the tropics
are the keenest consumers, because culturally, it's acceptable. Species in those regions
are also large, diverse, and tend to congregate in groups or swarms that make them easy to harvest. Take Cambodia in Southeast Asia where huge tarantulas are gathered, fried, and sold in the marketplace. In southern Africa, the juicy mopane worm is a dietary staple, simmered in a spicy sauce or eaten dried and salted. And in Mexico, chopped jumiles
are toasted with garlic, lemon, and salt. Bugs can be eaten whole to make up a meal or ground into flour, powder,
and paste to add to food. But it's not all about taste. They're also healthy. In fact, scientists say entomophagy
could be a cost-effective solution for developing countries
that are food insecure. Insects can contain up to 80% protein, the body's vital building blocks, and are also high in energy-rich fat, fiber, and micronutrients
like vitamins and minerals. Did you know that most edible insects
contain the same amount or even more mineral iron than beef, making them a huge, untapped resource
when you consider that iron deficiency is currently the most common
nutritional problem in the world? The mealworm
is another nutritious example. The yellow beetle larvae are native
to America and easy to farm. They have a high vitamin content, loads of healthy minerals, and can contain up to 50% protein, almost as much as in an equivalent
amount of beef. To cook, simply sauté in butter and salt or roast and drizzle with chocolate
for a crunchy snack. What you have to overcome in "ick factor," you gain in nutrition and taste. Indeed, bugs can be delicious. Mealworms taste like roasted nuts. Locusts are similar to shrimp. Crickets, some people say,
have an aroma of popcorn. Farming insects for food
also has less environmental impact than livestock farms do because insects emit
far less greenhouse gas and use up less space, water, and food. Socioeconomically, bug production could uplift people
in developing countries since insect farms can be small scale, highly productive, and yet
relatively inexpensive to keep. Insects can also be turned
into more sustainable food for livestock and can be reared on organic waste, like vegetable peelings, that might otherwise
just end up rotting in landfills. Feeling hungry yet? Faced with a plate of fried crickets,
most people today would still recoil, imagining all those legs and feelers
getting stuck between their teeth. But think of a lobster. It's pretty much just a giant insect
with legs and feelers galore that was once regarded
as an inferior, repulsive food. Now, lobster is a delicacy. Can the same paradigm shift
happen for bugs? So, give it a try! Pop that insect into your mouth, and savor the crunch.

**Transcript**:
[Why don't we eat bugs?] For centuries, people have consumed bugs, everything from beetles to caterpillars, locusts, grasshoppers, termites, and dragonflies. The practice even has a name: entomophagy. Early hunter-gatherers
probably learned from animals that foraged for protein-rich insects
and followed suit. As we evolved and bugs
became part of our dietary tradition, they fulfilled the role
of both staple food and delicacy. In ancient Greece, cicadas
were considered luxury snacks. And even the Romans found
beetle larvae to be scrumptious. Why have we lost our taste for bugs? The reason for our rejection
is historical, and the story probably begins around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent, a place in the Middle East that was a major birthplace
of agriculture. Back then, our once-nomadic ancestors
began to settle in the Crescent. And as they learned to farm crops
and domesticate animals there, attitudes changed, rippling outwards towards Europe
and the rest of the Western world. As farming took off, people might have spurned
bugs as mere pests that destroyed their crops. Populations grew,
and the West became urbanized, weakening connections
with our foraging past. People simply forgot
their bug-rich history. Today, for people not
accustomed to entomophagy, bugs are just an irritant. They sting and bite and infest our food. We feel an "ick factor"
associated with them and are disgusted
by the prospect of cooking insects. Almost 2,000 insect species
are turned into food, forming a big part of everyday diets for two billion people around the world. Countries in the tropics
are the keenest consumers, because culturally, it's acceptable. Species in those regions
are also large, diverse, and tend to congregate in groups or swarms that make them easy to harvest. Take Cambodia in Southeast Asia where huge tarantulas are gathered, fried, and sold in the marketplace. In southern Africa, the juicy mopane worm is a dietary staple, simmered in a spicy sauce or eaten dried and salted. And in Mexico, chopped jumiles
are toasted with garlic, lemon, and salt. Bugs can be eaten whole to make up a meal or ground into flour, powder,
and paste to add to food. But it's not all about taste. They're also healthy. In fact, scientists say entomophagy
could be a cost-effective solution for developing countries
that are food insecure. Insects can contain up to 80% protein, the body's vital building blocks, and are also high in energy-rich fat, fiber, and micronutrients
like vitamins and minerals. Did you know that most edible insects
contain the same amount or even more mineral iron than beef, making them a huge, untapped resource
when you consider that iron deficiency is currently the most common
nutritional problem in the world? The mealworm
is another nutritious example. The yellow beetle larvae are native
to America and easy to farm. They have a high vitamin content, loads of healthy minerals, and can contain up to 50% protein, almost as much as in an equivalent
amount of beef. To cook, simply sauté in butter and salt or roast and drizzle with chocolate
for a crunchy snack. What you have to overcome in "ick factor," you gain in nutrition and taste. Indeed, bugs can be delicious. Mealworms taste like roasted nuts. Locusts are similar to shrimp. Crickets, some people say,
have an aroma of popcorn. Farming insects for food
also has less environmental impact than livestock farms do because insects emit
far less greenhouse gas and use up less space, water, and food. Socioeconomically, bug production could uplift people
in developing countries since insect farms can be small scale, highly productive, and yet
relatively inexpensive to keep. Insects can also be turned
into more sustainable food for livestock and can be reared on organic waste, like vegetable peelings, that might otherwise
just end up rotting in landfills. Feeling hungry yet? Faced with a plate of fried crickets,
most people today would still recoil, imagining all those legs and feelers
getting stuck between their teeth. But think of a lobster. It's pretty much just a giant insect
with legs and feelers galore that was once regarded
as an inferior, repulsive food. Now, lobster is a delicacy. Can the same paradigm shift
happen for bugs? So, give it a try! Pop that insect into your mouth, and savor the crunch.

**Transcript**:
Looking up at the night sky, we are amazed by how it seems to go on forever. But what will the sky look like billions of years from now? A particular type of scientist, called a cosmologist, spends her time thinking about that very question. The end of the universe is intimately linked to what the universe contains. Over 100 years ago, Einstein developed the Theory of General Relativity, formed of equations that help us understand the relationship between what a universe is made of and its shape. It turns out that the universe could be curved like a ball or sphere. We call this positively curved or closed. Or it could be shaped like a saddle. We call this negatively curved or open. Or it could be flat. And that shape determines how the universe will live and die. We now know that the universe is very close to flat. However, the components of the universe can still affect its eventual fate. We can predict how the universe will change with time if we measure the amounts or energy densities of the various components in the universe today. So, what is the universe made of? The universe contains all the things that we can see, like stars, gas, and planets. We call these things ordinary or baryonic matter. Even though we see them all around us, the total energy density of these components is actually very small, around 5% of the total energy of the universe. So, now let's talk about what the other 95% is. Just under 27% of the rest of the energy density of the universe is made up of what we call dark matter. Dark matter is only very weakly interacting with light, which means it doesn't shine or reflect light in the way that stars and planets do, but, in every other way, it behaves like ordinary matter -- it attracts things gravitationally. In fact, the only way we can detect this dark matter is through this gravitational interaction, how things orbit around it and how it bends light as it curves the space around it. We have yet to discover a dark matter particle, but scientists all over the world are searching for this elusive particle or particles and the effects of dark matter on the universe. But this still doesn't add up to 100%. The remaining 68% of the energy density of the universe is made up of dark energy, which is even more mysterious than dark matter. This dark energy doesn't behave like any other substance we know at all and acts more like anti-gravity force. We say that it has a gravitational pressure, which ordinary matter and dark matter do not. Instead of pulling the universe together, as we would expect gravity to do, the universe appears to be expanding apart at an ever-increasing rate. The leading idea for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant. That means it has the strange property that it expands as the volume of space increases to keep its energy density constant. So, as the universe expands as it is doing right now, there will be more and more dark energy. Dark matter and baryonic matter, on the other hand, don't expand with the universe and become more diluted. Because of this property of the cosmological constant, the future universe will be more and more dominated by dark energy, becoming colder and colder and expanding faster and faster. Eventually, the universe will run out of gas to form stars, and the stars themselves will run out of fuel and burn out, leaving the universe with only black holes in it. Given enough time, even these black holes will evaporate, leaving a universe that is completely cold and empty. That is what we call the heat death of the universe. While it might sound depressing living in a universe that will end its lifetime cold and devoid of life, the end fate of our universe actually has a beautiful symmetry to its hot, fiery beginning. We call the accelerating end state of the universe a de Sitter phase, named after the Dutch mathematician Willem de Sitter. However, we also believe that the universe had another phase of de Sitter expansion in the earliest times of its life. We call this early period inflation, where, shortly after the Big Bang, the universe expanded extremely fast for a brief period. So, the universe will end in much the same state as it began, accelerating. We live at an extraordinary time in the life of the universe where we can start to understand the universe's journey and view a history that plays itself out on the sky for all of us to see.

While it might sound depressing living in a universe that will end its lifetime cold and devoid of life, the end fate of our universe actually has a beautiful symmetry to its hot, fiery beginning. We call the accelerating end state of the universe a de Sitter phase, named after the Dutch mathematician Willem de Sitter. However, we also believe that the universe had another phase of de Sitter expansion in the earliest times of its life. We call this early period inflation, where, shortly after the Big Bang, the universe expanded extremely fast for a brief period. So, the universe will end in much the same state as it began, accelerating. We live at an extraordinary time in the life of the universe where we can start to understand the universe's journey and view a history that plays itself out on the sky for all of us to see.

**Transcript**:
Looking up at the night sky, we are amazed by how it seems to go on forever. But what will the sky look like billions of years from now? A particular type of scientist, called a cosmologist, spends her time thinking about that very question. The end of the universe is intimately linked to what the universe contains. Over 100 years ago, Einstein developed the Theory of General Relativity, formed of equations that help us understand the relationship between what a universe is made of and its shape. It turns out that the universe could be curved like a ball or sphere. We call this positively curved or closed. Or it could be shaped like a saddle. We call this negatively curved or open. Or it could be flat. And that shape determines how the universe will live and die. We now know that the universe is very close to flat. However, the components of the universe can still affect its eventual fate. We can predict how the universe will change with time if we measure the amounts or energy densities of the various components in the universe today. So, what is the universe made of? The universe contains all the things that we can see, like stars, gas, and planets. We call these things ordinary or baryonic matter. Even though we see them all around us, the total energy density of these components is actually very small, around 5% of the total energy of the universe. So, now let's talk about what the other 95% is. Just under 27% of the rest of the energy density of the universe is made up of what we call dark matter. Dark matter is only very weakly interacting with light, which means it doesn't shine or reflect light in the way that stars and planets do, but, in every other way, it behaves like ordinary matter -- it attracts things gravitationally. In fact, the only way we can detect this dark matter is through this gravitational interaction, how things orbit around it and how it bends light as it curves the space around it. We have yet to discover a dark matter particle, but scientists all over the world are searching for this elusive particle or particles and the effects of dark matter on the universe. But this still doesn't add up to 100%. The remaining 68% of the energy density of the universe is made up of dark energy, which is even more mysterious than dark matter. This dark energy doesn't behave like any other substance we know at all and acts more like anti-gravity force. We say that it has a gravitational pressure, which ordinary matter and dark matter do not. Instead of pulling the universe together, as we would expect gravity to do, the universe appears to be expanding apart at an ever-increasing rate. The leading idea for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant. That means it has the strange property that it expands as the volume of space increases to keep its energy density constant. So, as the universe expands as it is doing right now, there will be more and more dark energy. Dark matter and baryonic matter, on the other hand, don't expand with the universe and become more diluted. Because of this property of the cosmological constant, the future universe will be more and more dominated by dark energy, becoming colder and colder and expanding faster and faster. Eventually, the universe will run out of gas to form stars, and the stars themselves will run out of fuel and burn out, leaving the universe with only black holes in it. Given enough time, even these black holes will evaporate, leaving a universe that is completely cold and empty. That is what we call the heat death of the universe. While it might sound depressing living in a universe that will end its lifetime cold and devoid of life, the end fate of our universe actually has a beautiful symmetry to its hot, fiery beginning. We call the accelerating end state of the universe a de Sitter phase, named after the Dutch mathematician Willem de Sitter.

We live at an extraordinary time in the life of the universe where we can start to understand the universe's journey and view a history that plays itself out on the sky for all of us to see.

**Transcript**:
We live in a society obsessed with music. We use music to worship, tell stories, to celebrate, to work, exercise, declare our love and sometimes our hatred, and, arguably most importantly, to dance. And, of course, we play music ourselves because, well, it's a pleasant thing to do. Thousands of years ago 
in Ancient Greece, when it came to music, things weren't much different. They might have had lyres and tunics instead of MP3 players and jeans, but the Ancient Greeks 
were just as obsessed with music as we are today. In fact, music was such 
an important part of Ancient Greek society that it makes us seem 
tame by comparison. To really understand just 
how integral music was to the Ancient Greeks, let's begin by acquainting ourselves with a bit of their mythology. In Ancient Greek mythology, it was believed that human creativity was the result of divine inspiration from a group of goddesses 
known as the Muses. While scholars have argued 
over the years that there are anything 
between 3 and 13 Muses, the standard number accepted today is 9. Each Muse oversees her own specific area of artistic expertise, ranging from song and dance to history and astronomy. It might seem strange to categorize history and astronomy 
as creative pursuits, but the Ancient Greeks 
saw these disciplines as more than just school subjects. These were the hallmarks of civilization in what, to their eyes, was a pretty barbaric world. An educated, civilized person was expected to be proficient in all aspects of creative thought inspired by the Muses, and the common medium through which these 
disciplines were taught, studied, and disseminated was music. You see, it's no coincidence that the word Muse is very similar to the word music. It's where the word originates. Poetry, be it a love poem or an epic poem about 
a dragon-slaying hero, was sung with a musical accompaniment. Dancing and singing, obviously, were accompanied by music. Theater was always a combination of spoken word and music. History was recounted through song. Even the study of astronomy was linked to the same physical principles as musical harmony, such as the belief held 
by many Greek thinkers that each of the planets and stars created their own unique sound as they traveled through the cosmos, thrumming like 
an enormous guitar string light-years long. However, music pervaded 
more aspects of their lives than just education. Ancient Greeks considered music to be the basis for understanding the fundamental interconnectedness of all things in the universe. This concept of connectivity is known as harmonia, and it's where we get the word harmony. Music was used as a form of medicine to treat illnesses and physical complaints, as a vital accompaniment 
to sporting contests, and as a means to keep workers in time as they toiled away on 
monotonous or menial tasks. One of the most important applications of music in Ancient Greek society is found in the belief that music can affect a person's ethos. A word we still use today, ethos is a person's guiding beliefs or personal ethics, the way that one behaves towards oneself and others. The Greek philosopher Plato, one of the most famous and influential Greek 
thinkers of the time, asserted that music had a direct effect on a person's ethos. Certain kinds of music could incite a person to violence while others could placate a person into a benign, unthinking stupor. According to Plato, only very specific types of music were beneficial to a person's ethos. One should only listen to music that promotes intelligence, self-discipline, and courage, and all other kinds 
of music must be avoided. Furthermore, Plato fervently denounced any music that deviated from established musical conventions, fearing that doing so would lead to the degradation of the standards of civilization, the corruption of youth, and eventually complete 
and utter anarchy. While Plato's fears can seem extreme, this argument has appeared 
in modern times to condemn musical trends such as jazz or punk or rap. What do you think Plato would say about the music you listen to? Is it beneficial to your ethos, or will it degenerate you into a gibbering, amoral barbarian?

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 7, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What's the worst bug on the planet? You might vote for the horsefly
or perhaps the wasp, but for many people, the worst offender is by far the mosquito. The buzzing, the biting, the itching, the mosquito is one of the most commonly
detested pests in the world. In Alaska, swarms
of mosquitos can get so thick that they actually asphyxiate caribou. And mosquito-borne diseases
kill millions of people every year. The scourge
that is the mosquito isn't new. Mosquitoes have been around
for over a hundred million years and over that time have coevolved
with all sorts of species, including our own. There are actually thousands
of species of mosquitos in the world, but they all share one insidious quality: they suck blood, and they're really, really
good at sucking blood. Here's how they do it. After landing, a mosquito will slather some saliva onto the victim's skin,
which works like an antiseptic, numbing the spot so we don't
notice their attack. This is what causes the itchy,
red bumps, by the way. Then the bug will use
its serrated mandibles to carve a little hole in your skin, allowing it to probe around
with its proboscis, searching for a blood vessel. When it hits one,
the lucky parasite can suck two to three times its weight in blood. Turns out we don't really
like that too much. In fact, humans hate mosquitos so much that we spend billions
of dollars worldwide to keep them away from us -- from citronella candles to bug sprays to heavy-duty
agricultural pesticides. But it's not just
that mosquitos are annoying, they're also deadly. Mosquitos can transmit everything
from malaria to yellow fever to West Nile virus to dengue. Over a million people worldwide die every year
from mosquito-borne diseases, and that's just people. Horses, dogs, cats, they can all get diseases
from mosquitoes too. So, if these bugs are so dastardly,
why don't we just get rid of them? We are humans after all, and we're pretty good
at getting rid of species. Well, it's not quite so simple. Getting rid of the mosquito
removes a food source for lots of organisms,
like frogs and fish and birds. Without them,
plants would lose a pollinator. But some scientists say that mosquitos aren't
actually all that important. If we got rid of them, they argue, another species would simply
take their place and we'd probably have far
fewer deaths from malaria. The problem is that nobody
knows what would happen if we killed off all the mosquitos. Something better might take their spot or perhaps something even worse. The question is,
are we willing to take that risk? (Buzzing)

Sometimes the imagery is intangible or way too complicated to explain with a picture. Although complex information could be relayed using charts and stats, this could get pretty boring. Instead, just like when writing an essay to describe, for example, emotions, illustrators can use visual metaphors to bring to life difficult concepts. Just as a written metaphor is a description that relates one object to another, a visual metaphor uses imagery to suggest a particular association or point of similarity. Our lesson "Big Data" is a great example of a situation where visual metaphors played a huge role in explaining the concept. What is Big Data in the first place? Good question! Big Data is a huge amount of digital information produced worldwide on a daily basis, challenging us to find solutions for storing, analyzing, and also imagining it visually. Quite an elusive concept! How should we depict this? Let's take a look at our "Big Data" script. We start with smaller computer servers that branch out into bigger networks to produce data, then even bigger networks and production of even more data. You see where we're going with this -- an object growing and branching out in many directions and producing something as a result? Does that remind you of something? Just like those computer networks, a tree grows and branches out to produce more leaves each year. And every year, just as the data accumulates and faces us with a challenge to find storage solutions, it gets harder to collect those piles of leaves when they fall off the tree. Aha! There's our visual metaphor! Okay, so we have the script, audio, and a visual metaphor. The next step in visual development is to design the characters and environments of the animation. To do so, we think of an appropriate and appealing style to illustrate the ideas and help the viewer better understand what they're hearing. Let's go back to the script and see if we can find any clues there. Our story starts in the 1960s when the first computer networks were built. This decade will serve as a good point to make the stylistic choice for our animation as it will allow us to refer to artwork from that era. You may want to start by looking at some art books (design, illustrations, cartoons, etc.) from that era and find a style that may our own purpose. Look closely, study the material, and try to understand the choices artists of that time made and why. For example, the 1960s minimalist animation style was a significant departure from the cinematic realism that was popular in animated films at the time. The choice to use limited animation techniques was originally made for budgetary reasons, but it became a signature style that influenced many future generations of animators. In this stylistic approach, the simplified characters, flat backgrounds, and angular shapes come together to create new interpretations of reality, which also sounds like a good place to begin visualizing our own Big Data. Well, let's try an experiment. "In the 1980s islands of similar networks speaking different dialects sprung up all over Europe and the States, making remote access possible but tortuous." Is this better? "In the 1980s islands of similar networks speaking different dialects sprung up all over Europe and the States, making remote access possible but tortuous. To make it easy for our physicists across the world to access the ever-expanding Big Data stored at CERN without traveling, the networks needed to be talking with the same language." As you probably observed, graphic representations are a great way to capture the interest of your audience. By depicting what you want to present and explain with strong, memorable visuals, you can communicate your idea more effectively. So, now, challenge yourself. Think of an abstract concept that cannot be explained with simple words. Go ahead and try your hand at visually developing that idea.

**Transcript**:
In a time-lapse video,
it looks like a monster coming alive. For a moment, it sits there innocuously. Then, ripples move across its surface. It bulges outwards,
bursting with weird boils. It triples in volume. Its color darkens ominously,
and its surface hardens into an alien topography
of peaks and craters. Then, the kitchen timer dings. Your cookie is ready. What happened inside that oven? Don't let the apron deceive you! Bakers are mad scientists. When you slide the pan into the oven, you're setting off a series
of chemical reactions that transform one substance, dough,
into another, cookies. When the dough reaches
92 degrees Fahrenheit, the butter inside melts, causing the dough to start spreading out. Butter is an emulsion, or mixture of two substances that don't want to stay together, in this case, water and fat, along with some dairy solids
that help hold them together. As the butter melts,
its trapped water is released. And as the cookie gets hotter,
the water expands into steam. It pushes against the dough
from the inside, trying to escape through the cookie walls like Ridley Scott's chest-bursting alien. Your eggs may have been home
to squirming salmonella bacteria. An estimated 142,000 Americans
are infected this way each year. Though salmonella can live for weeks
outside a living body and even survive freezing, 136 degrees is too hot for them. When your dough reaches
that temperature, they die off. You'll live to test your fate
with a bite of raw dough you sneak from your next batch. At 144 degrees,
changes begin in the proteins, which come mostly
from the eggs in your dough. Eggs are composed of dozens
of different kinds of proteins, each sensitive to a different temperature. In an egg fresh from the hen, these proteins look
like coiled up balls of string. When they're exposed to heat energy, the protein strings unfold
and get tangled up with their neighbors. This linked structure makes the runny egg nearly solid, giving substance to squishy dough. Water boils away at 212 degrees, so like mud baking in the sun, your cookie gets dried out
and it stiffens. Cracks spread across its surface. The steam that was bubbling
inside evaporates, leaving behind airy pockets
that make the cookie light and flaky. Helping this along
is your leavening agent, sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda. The sodium bicarbonate reacts
with acids in the dough to create carbon dioxide gas,
which makes airy pockets in your cookie. Now, it's nearly ready
for a refreshing dunk in a cool glass of milk. One of science's tastiest reactions occurs at 310 degrees. This is the temperature
for Maillard reactions. Maillard reactions result when proteins and sugars break down
and rearrange themselves, forming ring-like structures, which reflect light in a way that gives foods like Thanksgiving turkey and hamburgers their distinctive, rich brown color. As this reaction occurs, it produces a range of flavor
and aroma compounds, which also react with each other, forming even more complex
tastes and smells. Caramelization is the last reaction to take place inside your cookie. Caramelization is what happens when sugar molecules
break down under high heat, forming the sweet, nutty, and slightly bitter flavor compounds
that define, well, caramel. And, in fact, if your recipe
calls for a 350 degree oven, it'll never happen, since caramelization
starts at 356 degrees. If your ideal cookie is barely browned, like a Northeasterner on a beach vacation, you could have set
your oven to 310 degrees. If you like your cookies
to have a nice tan, crank up the heat. Caramelization continues
up to 390 degrees. And here's another trick: you don't need that kitchen timer; your nose is a sensitive
scientific instrument. When you smell the nutty, toasty aromas of the Maillard reaction
and caramelization, your cookies are ready. Grab your glass of milk, put your feet up, and reflect that science
can be pretty sweet.

**Transcript**:
[Music] in Albuquerque New Mexico an elderly woman was severely burned when she spilled a cup of McDonald's coffee in her lap an 81-year-old woman has been awarded $2.9 million after she sued McDonald's claiming their coffee was too hot Stella lebeck spilled just 8 ounces of coffee but she attracted a flood of attention the jury's award set off a media frenzy and became a rallying cry for those who believed are leg system at run a monck I think it's absurd but as her story cycled through newspaper headlines talk show story lines and late night punch lines one thing was lost the facts this story is the most widely misunderstood story in [Music] America the the public perception of it is Stella leeck won a lottery she bought the coffee she spilled it on herself and now look she's a millionaire when of course the facts are much more complicated than that Stella lebeck was a 79-year-old Widow sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car when she was burned on February 27th 1992 she had recently quit her job as a department store clerk and moved to Albuquerque to be near her daughter the day that the burns happened my mother and my nephew went through the drive-thru at McDonald's and got breakfast and coffee and they pulled into the parking lot and in the Ford Probe there's slanted surfaces everywhere there's no place to put the coffee she put it between her knees and lifted the lid off and in the process of doing that spilled the coffee and all of the hot liquid went into the sweatsuit that she was wearing and pulled in the the seat all I remember was trying to get out of the car I screamed not realizing I was burned that bad I knew I was in terrible pain the severity of the burns caused Stella Lebec to go into shock and her grandson immediately took her to the emergency room she was burned over 16% of her body 6% of the burns were third degree she was in the hospital for a week medical bills were $10,000 so Stella reached out to Donald's and asked to be reimbursed we couldn't believe that this could happen over spilling the coffee so we wrote a letter to McDonald's asking them to check the temperature of the coffee and to give recompense for the medical bills and the response from McDonald's was an offer of $800 Stella lebeck had never sued anyone before Albuquerque attorney Ken Wagner took her case before they went to trial they tried twice to settle out of court but McDonald's refused we bought a product it was used as intended it was unreasonably hot and therefore unreasonably dangerous and those were the essential facts I was not in it for the money I was in it because I want them to bring the temperature down so that people other people will not go through the same thing I did McDonald's policy was to serve coffee between 180 and 90° that's about 30° warmer than most home coffee brewing machines a burn expert testified that liquid at 180° could cause third degree burns within 15 seconds lawyers produced documents that showed that between 1983 and 1992 nearly 700 people claimed that they had been burned by hot coffee at McDonald's McDonald's was on Big Time notice that they had a product that was dangerous and it was burning people we argued that to the jury that they were callous and indifferent in simply not turning down a temperature an expert for McDonald's testified that burns are exceedingly rare one for every 24 million cups of coffee served they just said it's statistically insignificant and we're not going to change what we do people interact with hot beverages all the time in a fast food restaurant and that doesn't necessarily mean that restaurant is doing something wrong attorney Tracy jensx tried the case for McDonald's and argued that Mrs lebeck bore personal responsibility because she spilled the coffee on herself and that McDonald's coffee wasn't any hotter than the coffee at other fast food restaurants she said the reason the coffee was so hot was because that's what customers wanted McDonald's had a really really strong reason for why they brewed their coffee at the temperature they did it was an industrial standard based on the the maximum extraction of the flavor and the maximum holding temperature but the jury saw how liquid at that temperature can scald when they were shown graphic photos of Mrs leck's burned groin the photos depicted where they had to graph the skin from the side of her legs to close the third degree burn and I think if people would have seen the severity of the burns they would have realized it was not a laughing matter after 7 Days of testimony and 4 hours of deliberation jurors came up with a comprehensive answer to a complicated case they unanimously agreed to award Stella $200,000 in compensatory damages but because she caused the spill they reduced that to 160,000 jurors set punitive damages to send the message to McDonald's to turn down the temperature of the coffee I remember I could see Judge Scott going like this with his pencil and I I thought oh I hope he's counting digits on the verdict form and he was they based the amount on the revenue from two days of coffee sales $2.7 million the size of the award got the media's attention but it overshadowed the rest of the story details of the case and the facts related to how the jury made its decision went mostly unreported several days after the verdict I had news crews from France Japan Germany my driveway wanting to interview me mean I was stunned after the verdict came in Wednesday August 17th the Albuquerque Journal ran the first story The Associated Press and Reuters wire Services then filed reports and the story was picked up in dozens of newspapers worldwide it became an international news event but as the story's reach got bigger the word count got smaller in some papers who was not more than a blur 697 words in the in the Albuquerque Journal became 3 149 words in the AP and became as few as 48 words in various renderings by

very much like urban legends it is a very compelling story once everybody decides what is true about something and the media has been sort of an echo chamber for it then how do you deal with the fact that they might be wrong now she claims she broke her nose on the sneeze got at the Sizzler bending over looking at the chickpeas Oho my coffee was too hot it's coffee the lawsuit also got a lot of play on talk radio it was a very hot issue for a long time it's probably one of the most Sensational high-profile uh tort cases of the last 20 years so when tort reform comes up most people say oh you sure of the McDonald's case Republican lawmakers crafting the contract with America seize the moment they tapped into public outrage over frivolous lawsuits to promote the common sense legal Reform Act leck's case became exhibit a the lady goes through a fast food restaurant puts coffee in her lap Burns her her legs and sues and gets a big settlement that in of it of itself is enough to tell you why we need to have Tor reform she spilled hot coffee on her lap while sitting in her car and claimed it was too hot every day we hear about another outrageous lawsuit Stella's portrayal as a scheming wannabe millionaire was based on the jury's award but that amount was only a sugestion in reality the judge significantly reduced the punitive damages the judge reduced the award to about $650,000 according to a source familiar with the case it was settled for less than $500,000 Stella was not allowed to talk to the Press but over the last two decades her lawsuit has become part of the cultural discourse pardon me excuse us cof we got a chance do we have a chance you get me one coffee drinker on that jewelry you going to walk out of there a rich man Stella's daughter says that although over the years some stories have given greater context and A New Perspective such as the documentary hot coffee her family is still haunted by a perception that doesn't seem to go away getting bigger Jesus gettinger A C of cof million I like Toby Keith but he did the American Ride do we have to keep living this over and over and over again man it's hot how hot is it it's so hot I poured McDonald's coffee in my lap to cool off what people believe are the facts of this case and How Deeply held those convictions are has become useful to attorneys the case that became an example of jury's being out of control is now used to screen potential jurors It's a Wonderful litmus test if you're putting someone on a jury you really have to know how they feel about this case to know whether they are open to the facts that you're going to present McDonald's has been in the public mind cast as the victim that Stella liebeck needed to defend her reputation is the saddest piece of this whole story to me Stella lebeck died in 2004 when she was 91 the emotion that she went through she just felt like people were coming at her McDonald's Representatives didn't return emails or calls but according to current franchisee handbooks coffee must now be held and served 10° lower [Music] a

**Transcript**:
[Music] in Albuquerque New Mexico an elderly woman was severely burned when she spilled a cup of McDonald's coffee in her lap an 81-year-old woman has been awarded $2.9 million after she sued McDonald's claiming their coffee was too hot Stella lebeck spilled just 8 ounces of coffee but she attracted a flood of attention the jury's award set off a media frenzy and became a rallying cry for those who believed are leg system at run a monck I think it's absurd but as her story cycled through newspaper headlines talk show story lines and late night punch lines one thing was lost the facts this story is the most widely misunderstood story in [Music] America the the public perception of it is Stella leeck won a lottery she bought the coffee she spilled it on herself and now look she's a millionaire when of course the facts are much more complicated than that Stella lebeck was a 79-year-old Widow sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car when she was burned on February 27th 1992 she had recently quit her job as a department store clerk and moved to Albuquerque to be near her daughter the day that the burns happened my mother and my nephew went through the drive-thru at McDonald's and got breakfast and coffee and they pulled into the parking lot and in the Ford Probe there's slanted surfaces everywhere there's no place to put the coffee she put it between her knees and lifted the lid off and in the process of doing that spilled the coffee and all of the hot liquid went into the sweatsuit that she was wearing and pulled in the the seat all I remember was trying to get out of the car I screamed not realizing I was burned that bad I knew I was in terrible pain the severity of the burns caused Stella Lebec to go into shock and her grandson immediately took her to the emergency room she was burned over 16% of her body 6% of the burns were third degree she was in the hospital for a week medical bills were $10,000 so Stella reached out to Donald's and asked to be reimbursed we couldn't believe that this could happen over spilling the coffee so we wrote a letter to McDonald's asking them to check the temperature of the coffee and to give recompense for the medical bills and the response from McDonald's was an offer of $800 Stella lebeck had never sued anyone before Albuquerque attorney Ken Wagner took her case before they went to trial they tried twice to settle out of court but McDonald's refused we bought a product it was used as intended it was unreasonably hot and therefore unreasonably dangerous and those were the essential facts I was not in it for the money I was in it because I want them to bring the temperature down so that people other people will not go through the same thing I did McDonald's policy was to serve coffee between 180 and 90° that's about 30° warmer than most home coffee brewing machines a burn expert testified that liquid at 180° could cause third degree burns within 15 seconds lawyers produced documents that showed that between 1983 and 1992 nearly 700 people claimed that they had been burned by hot coffee at McDonald's McDonald's was on Big Time notice that they had a product that was dangerous and it was burning people we argued that to the jury that they were callous and indifferent in simply not turning down a temperature an expert for McDonald's testified that burns are exceedingly rare one for every 24 million cups of coffee served they just said it's statistically insignificant and we're not going to change what we do people interact with hot beverages all the time in a fast food restaurant and that doesn't necessarily mean that restaurant is doing something wrong attorney Tracy jensx tried the case for McDonald's and argued that Mrs lebeck bore personal responsibility because she spilled the coffee on herself and that McDonald's coffee wasn't any hotter than the coffee at other fast food restaurants she said the reason the coffee was so hot was because that's what customers wanted McDonald's had a really really strong reason for why they brewed their coffee at the temperature they did it was an industrial standard based on the the maximum extraction of the flavor and the maximum holding temperature but the jury saw how liquid at that temperature can scald when they were shown graphic photos of Mrs leck's burned groin the photos depicted where they had to graph the skin from the side of her legs to close the third degree burn and I think if people would have seen the severity of the burns they would have realized it was not a laughing matter after 7 Days of testimony and 4 hours of deliberation jurors came up with a comprehensive answer to a complicated case they unanimously agreed to award Stella $200,000 in compensatory damages but because she caused the spill they reduced that to 160,000 jurors set punitive damages to send the message to McDonald's to turn down the temperature of the coffee I remember I could see Judge Scott going like this with his pencil and I I thought oh I hope he's counting digits on the verdict form and he was they based the amount on the revenue from two days of coffee sales $2.7 million the size of the award got the media's attention but it overshadowed the rest of the story details of the case and the facts related to how the jury made its decision went mostly unreported several days after the verdict I had news crews from France Japan Germany my driveway wanting to interview me mean I was stunned after the verdict came in Wednesday August 17th the Albuquerque Journal ran the first story The Associated Press and Reuters wire Services then filed reports and the story was picked up in dozens of newspapers worldwide it became an international news event but as the story's reach got bigger the word count got smaller in some papers who was not more than a blur 697 words in the in the Albuquerque Journal became 3 149 words in the AP and became as few as 48 words in various renderings by Major Metropolitan newspapers 48 words can't explain a lot and then woman coffee Millions sounds like a ripoff not like a logical consequence of a thoughtful uh trial the report aired on more than a dozen National broadcasts and twice as many local news shows the condensed telling of the story created its own version of the truth instead of pointing out she spilled the coffee in the passenger seat of a parked car this was the new narrative it seems she was holding a cup between her legs while driving clamped it between her legs drove down the street spilled it burned herself sued McDonald's and collected Stella has received letters saying stuff like I was driving down the road I had no business driving down the road with coffee between my legs and all that stuff see they're just plain ignorant my mother was made the villain in this story it's like bullying it feels like bullying I mean it's not like the McDonald's person leaned over the car and poured it was an accident

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby In all times and places in our history, human beings have wondered, "Where did we come from? What's our place in the world? What happens to us after we die?" Religions are systems of belief that have developed and evolved over time in response to these and other eternal mysteries, driven by the feeling that some questions can only be answered by faith and based on an intuition that there is something greater than ourselves, a higher power we must answer to, or some source we all spring from and to which we must return. Hinduism means the religions of India. It's not a single religion but rather a variety of related beliefs and spiritual practices. It dates back five millennia to the time of Krishna, a man of such virtue that he became known as an avatar of Vishnu, an incarnation of the god in human form. He taught that all life follows karma, the law of cause and effect, and our job is to do our duty, or dharma, according to our place in society without worrying how things turn out. When we die, we are reincarnated into a new body. If we followed our dharma and did our proper duty in our past life, we get good karma, which sends our soul upward in the social scale. Our rebirth into the next life is thus determined by what we do in this one. The wheel of rebirths is called samsara. It's possible for a very holy person to lead a life with enough good karma to escape the wheel. This escape is called moksha. Hinduism teaches that everything is one. The whole universe is one transcendent reality called Brahman, and there's just one Brahman but many gods within it, and their roles, aspects, and forms differ according to various traditions. Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the preserver who sometimes takes on human form, and Shiva is the transformer, or Lord of the Dance. Durga is the fiercely protective divine mother. Ganesha has an elephant head and is the wise patron of success. Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world. And although most Hindus live in India, they can be found on every continent, one billion strong. Now, let's travel west, across deserts and mountains to the fertile crescent about 4,000 years ago. Judaism began with God calling Abraham and Sarah to leave Mesopotamia and migrate to the land of Canaan. In return for their faith in the one true God, a revolutionary concept in the polytheistic world of that time, they would have land and many descendants. From this promise came the land of Israel and the chosen people, but staying in that land and keeping those people together was going to be very difficult. The Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, but God freed them with the help of the prophet Moses, who received the Ten Commandments and later hundreds more. They conquered the Promised Land, but could only keep it for a few hundred years. Israel sits at a crossroads through which many armies marched over the centuries. And in the year 70, the Romans destroyed the temple in their capital, Jerusalem. So, the religion transformed itself from a temple religion with sacrifices and priests to a religion of the book. Because of this, Judaism is a faith of symbolism, reverence, and deep meanings tied to the literature of its history. The many sacred scriptures make up the Hebrew bible, or Tanakh, and hundreds of written discussions and interpretations are contained in an expansive compendium of deeper meanings, called the Talmud. Jews find rich, symbolic meaning in daily life. At the Passover meal, every item on the menu symbolizes an aspect of the escape from slavery. The importance of growing up is emphasized when young people reach the age of bar and bat mitzvah, ceremonies during which they assume responsibility for their actions and celebrate the weaving of their own lives into the faith, history, and texts of the Jewish people. There are 14 million Jews in the world today, 6 million in Israel, which became independent following the horrors of genocide in World War II, and 5 million in the United States. But now let's go back 2500 years and return to India where Buddhism began with a young prince named Siddhartha. On the night he was conceived, his mother, Queen Maya, is said to have been visited in her sleep by a white elephant who entered her side. Ten months later, Prince Siddartha was born into a life of luxury. Venturing forth from his sheltered existence as a young man, he witnessed the human suffering that had been hidden from him and immediately set out to investigate its sources. Why must people endure suffering? Must we reincarnate through hundreds of lives? At first he thought the problem was attachment to material things, so he gave up his possessions. He became a wandering beggar, which he discovered certainly made him no happier. Then he overheard a music teacher telling a student, "Don't tighten the string too much, it will break. But don't let it go too slack, or it will not sound." In a flash, he realized that looking for answers at the extremes was a mistake. The middle way between luxury and poverty seemed wisest. And while meditating under a bodhi tree, the rest of the answer came to him. All of life abounds with suffering. It's caused by selfish craving for one's own fulfillment at the expense of others. Following an eight-step plan can teach us to reduce that craving, and thus reduce the suffering. On that day, Siddhartha became the Buddha, the enlightened one. Not the only one, but the first one. The Buddhist plan is called the Eightfold Path, and though it is not easy to follow, it has pointed the way for millions to enlightenment, which is what Buddhahood means, a state of compassion, insight, peace, and steadfastness. From the time he got up from under that tree to the moment of his death as an old man, the Buddha taught people how to become enlightened: right speech, right goals, a mind focused on what is real, and a heart focused on loving others. Many Buddhists believe in God or gods, but actions are more important than beliefs. There are nearly a billion Buddhists in the world today, mostly in East, Southeast, and South Asia. 2,000 years ago in Judaism's Promised Land, Christianity was born. Just as Hindus called Krishna "God in Human Form," Christians say the same thing about Jesus, and Christianity grew out of Judaism just as Buddhism grew out of Hinduism. The angel Gabriel was sent by the God of Abraham to ask a young woman named Mary to become the mother of his son. The son was Jesus, raised as a carpenter by Mary and her husband Joseph, until he turned 30, when he began his public career as the living word of God. Less interested in religiousness than in justice and mercy, Jesus healed the sick in order to draw crowds and then taught them about his heavenly father -- affectionate, forgiving, and attentive. Then, he would invite everyone to a common table to illustrate his Kingdom of God, outcasts, sinners, and saints all eating together. He had only three years before his unconventional wisdom got him into trouble. His enemies had him arrested, and he was executed by Rome in the standard means by which rabble-rousers were put to death, crucifixion. But shortly after he was buried, women found his tomb empty and quickly spread word, convinced that he had been raised from the dead. The first Christians described his resurrected appearances, inspiring confidence that his message was true. The message: love one another as I have loved you. Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus in December at Christmas, and his suffering, death, and resurrection during Holy Week in the spring. In the ceremony of baptism, a washing away of sin and welcoming into the Christian community, recall Jesus's own baptism when he left his life as a carpenter. In the rite of Communion, Christians eat the bread and drink the wine blessed as the body and blood of Jesus, recalling Jesus's last supper. There are two billion Christians worldwide, representing almost a third of the world's people. Islam began 1400 years ago with a man of great virtue, meditating in a mountain cave in the Arabian desert. The man was Muhammad. He was visited by a divine messenger, again the angel Gabriel, in Arabic, Jibril, delivering to him the words of Allah, the one God of Abraham. In the next few years, more and more messages came, and he memorized and taught them. The verses he recited were full of wise sayings, beautiful rhymes, and mysterious metaphors. But Muhammad was a merchant, not a poet. Many agreed the verses were indeed the words of God, and these believers became the first Muslims. The word Muslim means one who surrenders, meaning a person who submits to the will of God. A Muslim's five most important duties are called the Five Pillars: Shahada, Muslims declare publicly, there is no other God but Allah, and Muhammad is his final prophet; Salat, they pray five times a day facing Mecca; Zakat, every Muslim is required to give 2 or 3% of their net worth to the poor; Sawm, they fast during daylight hours for the lunar month of Ramadan to strengthen their willpower and their reliance on God; and Hajj, once in a lifetime, every Muslim who is able must make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, rehearsing for the time when they will stand before God to be judged worthy or unworthy of eternal life with Him. The words of God, revealed to the prophet over 23 years, are collected in the Quran, which literally translates into "the recitation." Muslims believe it to be the only holy book free of human corruption. It's also considered by many to be the finest work of literature in the Arabic language. Islam is the world's second largest religion, practiced by over one and a half billion Muslims around the globe. Religion has been an aspect of culture for as long as it has existed, and there are countless variations of its practice. But common to all religions is an appeal for meaning beyond the empty vanities and lowly realities of existence, beyond sin, suffering, and death, beyond fear, and beyond ourselves.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby In all times and places in our history, human beings have wondered, "Where did we come from? What's our place in the world? What happens to us after we die?" Religions are systems of belief that have developed and evolved over time in response to these and other eternal mysteries, driven by the feeling that some questions can only be answered by faith and based on an intuition that there is something greater than ourselves, a higher power we must answer to, or some source we all spring from and to which we must return. Hinduism means the religions of India. It's not a single religion but rather a variety of related beliefs and spiritual practices. It dates back five millennia to the time of Krishna, a man of such virtue that he became known as an avatar of Vishnu, an incarnation of the god in human form. He taught that all life follows karma, the law of cause and effect, and our job is to do our duty, or dharma, according to our place in society without worrying how things turn out. When we die, we are reincarnated into a new body. If we followed our dharma and did our proper duty in our past life, we get good karma, which sends our soul upward in the social scale. Our rebirth into the next life is thus determined by what we do in this one. The wheel of rebirths is called samsara. It's possible for a very holy person to lead a life with enough good karma to escape the wheel. This escape is called moksha. Hinduism teaches that everything is one. The whole universe is one transcendent reality called Brahman, and there's just one Brahman but many gods within it, and their roles, aspects, and forms differ according to various traditions. Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the preserver who sometimes takes on human form, and Shiva is the transformer, or Lord of the Dance. Durga is the fiercely protective divine mother. Ganesha has an elephant head and is the wise patron of success. Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world. And although most Hindus live in India, they can be found on every continent, one billion strong. Now, let's travel west, across deserts and mountains to the fertile crescent about 4,000 years ago. Judaism began with God calling Abraham and Sarah to leave Mesopotamia and migrate to the land of Canaan. In return for their faith in the one true God, a revolutionary concept in the polytheistic world of that time, they would have land and many descendants. From this promise came the land of Israel and the chosen people, but staying in that land and keeping those people together was going to be very difficult. The Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, but God freed them with the help of the prophet Moses, who received the Ten Commandments and later hundreds more. They conquered the Promised Land, but could only keep it for a few hundred years. Israel sits at a crossroads through which many armies marched over the centuries. And in the year 70, the Romans destroyed the temple in their capital, Jerusalem. So, the religion transformed itself from a temple religion with sacrifices and priests to a religion of the book. Because of this, Judaism is a faith of symbolism, reverence, and deep meanings tied to the literature of its history. The many sacred scriptures make up the Hebrew bible, or Tanakh, and hundreds of written discussions and interpretations are contained in an expansive compendium of deeper meanings, called the Talmud. Jews find rich, symbolic meaning in daily life. At the Passover meal, every item on the menu symbolizes an aspect of the escape from slavery. The importance of growing up is emphasized when young people reach the age of bar and bat mitzvah, ceremonies during which they assume responsibility for their actions and celebrate the weaving of their own lives into the faith, history, and texts of the Jewish people. There are 14 million Jews in the world today, 6 million in Israel, which became independent following the horrors of genocide in World War II, and 5 million in the United States. But now let's go back 2500 years and return to India where Buddhism began with a young prince named Siddhartha. On the night he was conceived, his mother, Queen Maya, is said to have been visited in her sleep by a white elephant who entered her side. Ten months later, Prince Siddartha was born into a life of luxury. Venturing forth from his sheltered existence as a young man, he witnessed the human suffering that had been hidden from him and immediately set out to investigate its sources. Why must people endure suffering? Must we reincarnate through hundreds of lives? At first he thought the problem was attachment to material things, so he gave up his possessions. He became a wandering beggar, which he discovered certainly made him no happier. Then he overheard a music teacher telling a student, "Don't tighten the string too much, it will break. But don't let it go too slack, or it will not sound." In a flash, he realized that looking for answers at the extremes was a mistake. The middle way between luxury and poverty seemed wisest. And while meditating under a bodhi tree, the rest of the answer came to him. All of life abounds with suffering. It's caused by selfish craving for one's own fulfillment at the expense of others. Following an eight-step plan can teach us to reduce that craving, and thus reduce the suffering. On that day, Siddhartha became the Buddha, the enlightened one. Not the only one, but the first one. The Buddhist plan is called the Eightfold Path, and though it is not easy to follow, it has pointed the way for millions to enlightenment, which is what Buddhahood means, a state of compassion, insight, peace, and steadfastness. From the time he got up from under that tree to the moment of his death as an old man, the Buddha taught people how to become enlightened: right speech, right goals, a mind focused on what is real, and a heart focused on loving others. Many Buddhists believe in God or gods, but actions are more important than beliefs. There are nearly a billion Buddhists in the world today, mostly in East, Southeast, and South Asia. 2,000 years ago in Judaism's Promised Land, Christianity was born. Just as Hindus called Krishna "God in Human Form," Christians say the same thing about Jesus, and Christianity grew out of Judaism just as Buddhism grew out of Hinduism. The angel Gabriel was sent by the God of Abraham to ask a young woman named Mary to become the mother of his son. The son was Jesus, raised as a carpenter by Mary and her husband Joseph, until he turned 30, when he began his public career as the living word of God. Less interested in religiousness than in justice and mercy, Jesus healed the sick in order to draw crowds and then taught them about his heavenly father -- affectionate, forgiving, and attentive. Then, he would invite everyone to a common table to illustrate his Kingdom of God, outcasts, sinners, and saints all eating together. He had only three years before his unconventional wisdom got him into trouble. His enemies had him arrested, and he was executed by Rome in the standard means by which rabble-rousers were put to death, crucifixion. But shortly after he was buried, women found his tomb empty and quickly spread word, convinced that he had been raised from the dead. The first Christians described his resurrected appearances, inspiring confidence that his message was true. The message: love one another as I have loved you. Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus in December at Christmas, and his suffering, death, and resurrection during Holy Week in the spring. In the ceremony of baptism, a washing away of sin and welcoming into the Christian community, recall Jesus's own baptism when he left his life as a carpenter. In the rite of Communion, Christians eat the bread and drink the wine blessed as the body and blood of Jesus, recalling Jesus's last supper. There are two billion Christians worldwide, representing almost a third of the world's people. Islam began 1400 years ago with a man of great virtue, meditating in a mountain cave in the Arabian desert. The man was Muhammad. He was visited by a divine messenger, again the angel Gabriel, in Arabic, Jibril, delivering to him the words of Allah, the one God of Abraham. In the next few years, more and more messages came, and he memorized and taught them. The verses he recited were full of wise sayings, beautiful rhymes, and mysterious metaphors. But Muhammad was a merchant, not a poet. Many agreed the verses were indeed the words of God, and these believers became the first Muslims. The word Muslim means one who surrenders, meaning a person who submits to the will of God. A Muslim's five most important duties are called the Five Pillars: Shahada, Muslims declare publicly, there is no other God but Allah, and Muhammad is his final prophet; Salat, they pray five times a day facing Mecca; Zakat, every Muslim is required to give 2 or 3% of their net worth to the poor; Sawm, they fast during daylight hours for the lunar month of Ramadan to strengthen their willpower and their reliance on God; and Hajj, once in a lifetime, every Muslim who is able must make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, rehearsing for the time when they will stand before God to be judged worthy or unworthy of eternal life with Him. The words of God, revealed to the prophet over 23 years, are collected in the Quran, which literally translates into "the recitation." Muslims believe it to be the only holy book free of human corruption. It's also considered by many to be the finest work of literature in the Arabic language. Islam is the world's second largest religion, practiced by over one and a half billion Muslims around the globe. Religion has been an aspect of culture for as long as it has existed, and there are countless variations of its practice. But common to all religions is an appeal for meaning beyond the empty vanities and lowly realities of existence, beyond sin, suffering, and death, beyond fear, and beyond ourselves.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby In all times and places in our history, human beings have wondered, "Where did we come from? What's our place in the world? What happens to us after we die?" Religions are systems of belief that have developed and evolved over time in response to these and other eternal mysteries, driven by the feeling that some questions can only be answered by faith and based on an intuition that there is something greater than ourselves, a higher power we must answer to, or some source we all spring from and to which we must return.

The angel Gabriel was sent by the God of Abraham to ask a young woman named Mary to become the mother of his son. The son was Jesus, raised as a carpenter by Mary and her husband Joseph, until he turned 30, when he began his public career as the living word of God. Less interested in religiousness than in justice and mercy, Jesus healed the sick in order to draw crowds and then taught them about his heavenly father -- affectionate, forgiving, and attentive. Then, he would invite everyone to a common table to illustrate his Kingdom of God, outcasts, sinners, and saints all eating together. He had only three years before his unconventional wisdom got him into trouble. His enemies had him arrested, and he was executed by Rome in the standard means by which rabble-rousers were put to death, crucifixion. But shortly after he was buried, women found his tomb empty and quickly spread word, convinced that he had been raised from the dead. The first Christians described his resurrected appearances, inspiring confidence that his message was true. The message: love one another as I have loved you. Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus in December at Christmas, and his suffering, death, and resurrection during Holy Week in the spring. In the ceremony of baptism, a washing away of sin and welcoming into the Christian community, recall Jesus's own baptism when he left his life as a carpenter. In the rite of Communion, Christians eat the bread and drink the wine blessed as the body and blood of Jesus, recalling Jesus's last supper. There are two billion Christians worldwide, representing almost a third of the world's people. Islam began 1400 years ago with a man of great virtue, meditating in a mountain cave in the Arabian desert. The man was Muhammad. He was visited by a divine messenger, again the angel Gabriel, in Arabic, Jibril, delivering to him the words of Allah, the one God of Abraham. In the next few years, more and more messages came, and he memorized and taught them. The verses he recited were full of wise sayings, beautiful rhymes, and mysterious metaphors. But Muhammad was a merchant, not a poet. Many agreed the verses were indeed the words of God, and these believers became the first Muslims. The word Muslim means one who surrenders, meaning a person who submits to the will of God. A Muslim's five most important duties are called the Five Pillars: Shahada, Muslims declare publicly, there is no other God but Allah, and Muhammad is his final prophet; Salat, they pray five times a day facing Mecca; Zakat, every Muslim is required to give 2 or 3% of their net worth to the poor; Sawm, they fast during daylight hours for the lunar month of Ramadan to strengthen their willpower and their reliance on God; and Hajj, once in a lifetime, every Muslim who is able must make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, rehearsing for the time when they will stand before God to be judged worthy or unworthy of eternal life with Him. The words of God, revealed to the prophet over 23 years, are collected in the Quran, which literally translates into "the recitation." Muslims believe it to be the only holy book free of human corruption. It's also considered by many to be the finest work of literature in the Arabic language. Islam is the world's second largest religion, practiced by over one and a half billion Muslims around the globe. Religion has been an aspect of culture for as long as it has existed, and there are countless variations of its practice. But common to all religions is an appeal for meaning beyond the empty vanities and lowly realities of existence, beyond sin, suffering, and death, beyond fear, and beyond ourselves.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby In all times and places in our history, human beings have wondered, "Where did we come from? What's our place in the world? What happens to us after we die?" Religions are systems of belief that have developed and evolved over time in response to these and other eternal mysteries, driven by the feeling that some questions can only be answered by faith and based on an intuition that there is something greater than ourselves, a higher power we must answer to, or some source we all spring from and to which we must return. Hinduism means the religions of India. It's not a single religion but rather a variety of related beliefs and spiritual practices. It dates back five millennia to the time of Krishna, a man of such virtue that he became known as an avatar of Vishnu, an incarnation of the god in human form. He taught that all life follows karma, the law of cause and effect, and our job is to do our duty, or dharma, according to our place in society without worrying how things turn out. When we die, we are reincarnated into a new body. If we followed our dharma and did our proper duty in our past life, we get good karma, which sends our soul upward in the social scale. Our rebirth into the next life is thus determined by what we do in this one. The wheel of rebirths is called samsara. It's possible for a very holy person to lead a life with enough good karma to escape the wheel. This escape is called moksha. Hinduism teaches that everything is one. The whole universe is one transcendent reality called Brahman, and there's just one Brahman but many gods within it, and their roles, aspects, and forms differ according to various traditions. Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the preserver who sometimes takes on human form, and Shiva is the transformer, or Lord of the Dance. Durga is the fiercely protective divine mother. Ganesha has an elephant head and is the wise patron of success. Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world. And although most Hindus live in India, they can be found on every continent, one billion strong. Now, let's travel west, across deserts and mountains to the fertile crescent about 4,000 years ago. Judaism began with God calling Abraham and Sarah to leave Mesopotamia and migrate to the land of Canaan. In return for their faith in the one true God, a revolutionary concept in the polytheistic world of that time, they would have land and many descendants. From this promise came the land of Israel and the chosen people, but staying in that land and keeping those people together was going to be very difficult. The Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, but God freed them with the help of the prophet Moses, who received the Ten Commandments and later hundreds more. They conquered the Promised Land, but could only keep it for a few hundred years. Israel sits at a crossroads through which many armies marched over the centuries. And in the year 70, the Romans destroyed the temple in their capital, Jerusalem. So, the religion transformed itself from a temple religion with sacrifices and priests to a religion of the book. Because of this, Judaism is a faith of symbolism, reverence, and deep meanings tied to the literature of its history. The many sacred scriptures make up the Hebrew bible, or Tanakh, and hundreds of written discussions and interpretations are contained in an expansive compendium of deeper meanings, called the Talmud. Jews find rich, symbolic meaning in daily life. At the Passover meal, every item on the menu symbolizes an aspect of the escape from slavery. The importance of growing up is emphasized when young people reach the age of bar and bat mitzvah, ceremonies during which they assume responsibility for their actions and celebrate the weaving of their own lives into the faith, history, and texts of the Jewish people. There are 14 million Jews in the world today, 6 million in Israel, which became independent following the horrors of genocide in World War II, and 5 million in the United States. But now let's go back 2500 years and return to India where Buddhism began with a young prince named Siddhartha. On the night he was conceived, his mother, Queen Maya, is said to have been visited in her sleep by a white elephant who entered her side. Ten months later, Prince Siddartha was born into a life of luxury. Venturing forth from his sheltered existence as a young man, he witnessed the human suffering that had been hidden from him and immediately set out to investigate its sources. Why must people endure suffering? Must we reincarnate through hundreds of lives? At first he thought the problem was attachment to material things, so he gave up his possessions. He became a wandering beggar, which he discovered certainly made him no happier. Then he overheard a music teacher telling a student, "Don't tighten the string too much, it will break. But don't let it go too slack, or it will not sound." In a flash, he realized that looking for answers at the extremes was a mistake. The middle way between luxury and poverty seemed wisest. And while meditating under a bodhi tree, the rest of the answer came to him. All of life abounds with suffering. It's caused by selfish craving for one's own fulfillment at the expense of others. Following an eight-step plan can teach us to reduce that craving, and thus reduce the suffering. On that day, Siddhartha became the Buddha, the enlightened one. Not the only one, but the first one. The Buddhist plan is called the Eightfold Path, and though it is not easy to follow, it has pointed the way for millions to enlightenment, which is what Buddhahood means, a state of compassion, insight, peace, and steadfastness. From the time he got up from under that tree to the moment of his death as an old man, the Buddha taught people how to become enlightened: right speech, right goals, a mind focused on what is real, and a heart focused on loving others. Many Buddhists believe in God or gods, but actions are more important than beliefs. There are nearly a billion Buddhists in the world today, mostly in East, Southeast, and South Asia. 2,000 years ago in Judaism's Promised Land, Christianity was born. Just as Hindus called Krishna "God in Human Form," Christians say the same thing about Jesus, and Christianity grew out of Judaism just as Buddhism grew out of Hinduism.

**Transcript**:
Energy is not easy to define. Things have energy, but you can't hold a bushel of energy in your hands. You can see what it does, but you can't see it directly. There are different types of energy, but the differences between them are manifested only in how they make stuff behave. We do know that the total amount of all the different types of energy in the universe is always the same. And, for chemists, two important types of energy are chemical potential energy and kinetic energy. Potential energy is energy waiting to happen. Think of a stretched rubber band. If you cut it, all that potential energy gets converted to kinetic energy, which is registered by you as pain. Like a stretched rubber band, chemical bonds also store energy, and when those bonds are broken, that potential energy gets converted to other types of energy, like heat or light, or gets used to make different bonds. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and molecules are always moving. They're not necessarily going somewhere, though they could be, but they are vibrating, stretching, bending, and/or spinning. Take methane, which is four hydrogens attached to a central carbon, as an example. Drawn on paper, it's just a still tetrahedron. But in real life, it's a jiggling mess. The kinetic energy of molecules is exactly the same type of energy as the energy you have when you're moving around, except that you can be still and molecules can't. If you suck the kinetic energy out of a group of molecules, they'll move less, but they'll never fully stop. Now, in any group of molecules, some will have more kinetic energy than others. And if we calculate the average kinetic energy of the group, we'd have a number mathematically related to temperature. So, the more kinetic energy a group of molecules has, the higher its temperature. And that means that on a hot day, the molecules in the air around you are spinning, stretching, bending, and generally shooting around much faster than on a cold day. Now, hot and cold, by the way, are relative terms. They're always used to compare one thing to something else. So, on that hot summer day, the air molecules have more kinetic energy than the molecules in your skin. So, when those air molecules crash into you, they transfer some of their energy to the molecules in your skin, and you feel that as heat. On a cold day, the air molecules have less kinetic energy than the molecules in your skin, so when you crash into those air molecules, you actually transfer some of your kinetic energy to them, and you feel that as cold. You can trace the path of energy around you. Try it at your next cookout. You burn charcoal and the release of that chemical potential energy shows up as extreme heat and light. The heat then makes the molecules of your burgers, your hot dogs, or your vegetables vibrate until their own bonds break and new chemical structures are formed. Too much heat and you have a charred mess; just enough and you have dinner. Once in your body, the food molecules in your delicious, or charred, dinner get broken down, and the energy released is used to either keep you alive right now or it's stored for later in different molecules. As night falls, the hot summer air cools and the flow of energy into you slows. Then, as the air reaches your skin temperature, for the briefest of moments, the flow stops. And then it starts up again in the opposite direction as energy leaves the warmer surface of your skin to return to the universe around you, that energy, neither created nor destroyed, but ever shape-shifting, the chameleon phoenix of our physical world.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Energy is not easy to define. Things have energy, but you can't hold a bushel of energy in your hands. You can see what it does, but you can't see it directly. There are different types of energy, but the differences between them are manifested only in how they make stuff behave. We do know that the total amount of all the different types of energy in the universe is always the same. And, for chemists, two important types of energy are chemical potential energy and kinetic energy. Potential energy is energy waiting to happen. Think of a stretched rubber band. If you cut it, all that potential energy gets converted to kinetic energy, which is registered by you as pain. Like a stretched rubber band, chemical bonds also store energy, and when those bonds are broken, that potential energy gets converted to other types of energy, like heat or light, or gets used to make different bonds. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and molecules are always moving. They're not necessarily going somewhere, though they could be, but they are vibrating, stretching, bending, and/or spinning. Take methane, which is four hydrogens attached to a central carbon, as an example. Drawn on paper, it's just a still tetrahedron. But in real life, it's a jiggling mess. The kinetic energy of molecules is exactly the same type of energy as the energy you have when you're moving around, except that you can be still and molecules can't. If you suck the kinetic energy out of a group of molecules, they'll move less, but they'll never fully stop. Now, in any group of molecules, some will have more kinetic energy than others. And if we calculate the average kinetic energy of the group, we'd have a number mathematically related to temperature. So, the more kinetic energy a group of molecules has, the higher its temperature. And that means that on a hot day, the molecules in the air around you are spinning, stretching, bending, and generally shooting around much faster than on a cold day. Now, hot and cold, by the way, are relative terms. They're always used to compare one thing to something else. So, on that hot summer day, the air molecules have more kinetic energy than the molecules in your skin. So, when those air molecules crash into you, they transfer some of their energy to the molecules in your skin, and you feel that as heat. On a cold day, the air molecules have less kinetic energy than the molecules in your skin, so when you crash into those air molecules, you actually transfer some of your kinetic energy to them, and you feel that as cold. You can trace the path of energy around you. Try it at your next cookout. You burn charcoal and the release of that chemical potential energy shows up as extreme heat and light. The heat then makes the molecules of your burgers, your hot dogs, or your vegetables vibrate until their own bonds break and new chemical structures are formed. Too much heat and you have a charred mess; just enough and you have dinner. Once in your body, the food molecules in your delicious, or charred, dinner get broken down, and the energy released is used to either keep you alive right now or it's stored for later in different molecules. As night falls, the hot summer air cools and the flow of energy into you slows. Then, as the air reaches your skin temperature, for the briefest of moments, the flow stops. And then it starts up again in the opposite direction as energy leaves the warmer surface of your skin to return to the universe around you, that energy, neither created nor destroyed, but ever shape-shifting, the chameleon phoenix of our physical world.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Every chicken was once an egg, every oak tree an acorn, every frog a tadpole. The patch of mold on that old piece of bread in the back of your fridge, not so long ago that was one, solitary cell. Even you were once but a gleam in your parents' eyes. All these organisms share the same basic goal: to perpetuate their own existence. All lifeforms that we've discovered so far stay alive by using basically the same rules, materials, and machinery. Imagine a factory full of robots. These robots have two missions: one, keep the factory running, and two, when the time is right, set up an entirely new factory. To do those things, they need assembly instructions, raw materials, plenty of energy, a few rules about when to work normally, when to work quickly, or when to stop, and some exchange currencies because even robots need to get paid. Each factory has a high security office with blueprints for all the possible factory configurations and complete sets of instructions to make all the different types of robots a factory could ever need. Special robots photocopy these instructions and send them off to help make the building blocks of more robots. Their colleagues assemble those parts into still more robots, which are transported to the right location in the factory and given the tools they need to start working. Every robot draws energy from the central power plant, a giant furnace that can burn regular fuel but also scrap materials if not enough regular fuel is available. Certain zones in the factory have harsher working conditions, so these areas are walled off. But the robots inside can at least communicate with the rest of the factory through specialized portals embedded directly into the walls. And as you've probably figured out, what we're describing here is a cell. The high security office is the nucleus. It stores the blueprints and instructions as deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. The photocopied instructions are RNA. The robots themselves are mostly proteins built from amino acids, but they'll often use special tools that are, or are derived from, vitamins and minerals. The walls between factory zones and around the factory itself are mostly made up of lipids, a.k.a. fats. In most organisms, the primary fuel source are sugars, but in a pinch, fats and proteins can be broken down and burned in the furnace as well. The portals are membrane proteins which allow very specific materials and information to pass through the walls at the right times. Many interactions between robot proteins require some kind of push, think robot minimum wage. A few small but crucial forms of money are transferred between proteins to provide this push. Electrons, protons, oxygen, and phosphate groups are the main chemical currencies, and they're kept in small molecular wallets or larger tote bags to keep them safe. This is biochemistry, the study of how every part of the factory interacts to keep your life running smoothly in the face of extreme challenges. Maybe there's too much fuel; your body will store the excess as glycogen or fat. Maybe there's not enough; your body will use up those energy reserves. Maybe a virus or bacteria tries to invade; your body will mobilize the immune system. Maybe you touched something hot or sharp; your nerves will let you know so you can stop. Maybe it's time to create a new cell or a new person. Amazingly, oak trees, chickens, frogs, and, yes, even you share so many of the same basic robot and factory designs that biochemists can learn a lot about all of them all at the same time.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Every chicken was once an egg, every oak tree an acorn, every frog a tadpole. The patch of mold on that old piece of bread in the back of your fridge, not so long ago that was one, solitary cell. Even you were once but a gleam in your parents' eyes. All these organisms share the same basic goal: to perpetuate their own existence. All lifeforms that we've discovered so far stay alive by using basically the same rules, materials, and machinery. Imagine a factory full of robots. These robots have two missions: one, keep the factory running, and two, when the time is right, set up an entirely new factory. To do those things, they need assembly instructions, raw materials, plenty of energy, a few rules about when to work normally, when to work quickly, or when to stop, and some exchange currencies because even robots need to get paid. Each factory has a high security office with blueprints for all the possible factory configurations and complete sets of instructions to make all the different types of robots a factory could ever need. Special robots photocopy these instructions and send them off to help make the building blocks of more robots. Their colleagues assemble those parts into still more robots, which are transported to the right location in the factory and given the tools they need to start working. Every robot draws energy from the central power plant, a giant furnace that can burn regular fuel but also scrap materials if not enough regular fuel is available. Certain zones in the factory have harsher working conditions, so these areas are walled off. But the robots inside can at least communicate with the rest of the factory through specialized portals embedded directly into the walls. And as you've probably figured out, what we're describing here is a cell. The high security office is the nucleus. It stores the blueprints and instructions as deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. The photocopied instructions are RNA. The robots themselves are mostly proteins built from amino acids, but they'll often use special tools that are, or are derived from, vitamins and minerals. The walls between factory zones and around the factory itself are mostly made up of lipids, a.k.a. fats. In most organisms, the primary fuel source are sugars, but in a pinch, fats and proteins can be broken down and burned in the furnace as well. The portals are membrane proteins which allow very specific materials and information to pass through the walls at the right times. Many interactions between robot proteins require some kind of push, think robot minimum wage. A few small but crucial forms of money are transferred between proteins to provide this push. Electrons, protons, oxygen, and phosphate groups are the main chemical currencies, and they're kept in small molecular wallets or larger tote bags to keep them safe. This is biochemistry, the study of how every part of the factory interacts to keep your life running smoothly in the face of extreme challenges. Maybe there's too much fuel; your body will store the excess as glycogen or fat. Maybe there's not enough; your body will use up those energy reserves. Maybe a virus or bacteria tries to invade; your body will mobilize the immune system. Maybe you touched something hot or sharp; your nerves will let you know so you can stop. Maybe it's time to create a new cell or a new person. Amazingly, oak trees, chickens, frogs, and, yes, even you share so many of the same basic robot and factory designs that biochemists can learn a lot about all of them all at the same time.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
When the next general election rolls around, who will be eligible to show up at the polls and vote for the President of the United States? It's really pretty simple. If you are at least 18 years old, a citizen of the U.S., and a resident of a state, you can vote, assuming, that is, you are not a felon. Seems about right. After all, the United States prides itself on being a democracy, or a government in which the ultimate authority lies with the citizens of the nation. But it was not always this way. In 1789, George Washington won the electoral college with 100% of the vote, but whose vote was it? Probably not yours. Only 6% of the entire United States population was allowed to vote at all. Voting was a right that only white, male property owners were allowed to exercise. By the 1820s and 1830s, the American population was booming from the east coast into the western frontier. Frontier farmers were resilient, self-reliant, and mostly ineligible to vote because they did not own land. As these new areas of the nation became states, they typically left out the property requirement for voting. Leaders such as Andrew Jackson, the United State's first common man President, promoted what he called universal suffrage. Of course, by universal suffrage, Jackson really meant universal white, male suffrage. All he emphasized was getting rid of the property requirement for voting, not expanding the vote beyond white men. By the 1850s, about 55% of the adult population was eligible to vote in the U.S., much better than 6%, but far from everybody. Then, in 1861, the American Civil War began largely over the issue of slavery and states' rights in the United States. When it was all over, the U.S. ratified the 15th Amendment, which promised that a person's right to vote could not be denied based on race, color, or previous condition as a slave. This meant that black men, newly affirmed as citizens of the U.S., would now be allowed to vote. Of course, laws are far from reality. Despite the promise of the 15th Amendment, intimidation kept African-Americans from exercising their voting rights. States passed laws that limited the rights of African-Americans to vote, including things like literacy tests, which were rigged so that not even literate African-Americans were allowed to pass, and poll taxes. So, despite the 15th Amendment, by 1892, only about 6% of black men in Mississippi were registered to vote. By 1960, it was only 1%. And, of course, women were still totally out of the national voting picture. It wasn't until 1920 that the women's suffrage movement won their 30-year battle, and the 19th Amendment finally gave women the vote, well, white women. The restrictions on African-Americans, including African-American women, remained. After World War II, many Americans began to question the state of U.S. democracy. How could a nation that fought for freedom and human rights abroad come home and deny suffrage based on race? The modern civil rights movement began in the 1940s with those questions in mind. After years of sacrifice, bloodshed, and pain, the United States passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, finally eliminating restrictions such as literacy tests and protecting the voting rights promised under the 15th Amendment to the Constitution. Now, any citizen over the age of 21 could vote. All seemed well until the United States went to war. When the Vietnam War called up all men age 18 and over for the draft, many wondered whether it was fair to send men who couldn't vote to war. In 1971, the 26th Amendment to the Constitution made all citizens 18 and older eligible to vote, the last major expansion of voting rights in the United States. Today, the pool of eligible voters in the U.S. is far broader and more inclusive than ever before in U.S. history. But, of course, it's not perfect. There are still active efforts to suppress some groups from voting, and only about 60% of those who can vote do. Now that you know all the hard work that went into securing the right to vote, what do you think? Do enough citizens have the right to vote now? And among those who can vote, why don't more of them do it?

It wasn't until 1920 that the women's suffrage movement won their 30-year battle, and the 19th Amendment finally gave women the vote, well, white women. The restrictions on African-Americans, including African-American women, remained. After World War II, many Americans began to question the state of U.S. democracy. How could a nation that fought for freedom and human rights abroad come home and deny suffrage based on race? The modern civil rights movement began in the 1940s with those questions in mind. After years of sacrifice, bloodshed, and pain, the United States passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, finally eliminating restrictions such as literacy tests and protecting the voting rights promised under the 15th Amendment to the Constitution. Now, any citizen over the age of 21 could vote. All seemed well until the United States went to war. When the Vietnam War called up all men age 18 and over for the draft, many wondered whether it was fair to send men who couldn't vote to war. In 1971, the 26th Amendment to the Constitution made all citizens 18 and older eligible to vote, the last major expansion of voting rights in the United States. Today, the pool of eligible voters in the U.S. is far broader and more inclusive than ever before in U.S. history. But, of course, it's not perfect. There are still active efforts to suppress some groups from voting, and only about 60% of those who can vote do. Now that you know all the hard work that went into securing the right to vote, what do you think? Do enough citizens have the right to vote now? And among those who can vote, why don't more of them do it?

**Transcript**:
When the next general election rolls around, who will be eligible to show up at the polls and vote for the President of the United States? It's really pretty simple. If you are at least 18 years old, a citizen of the U.S., and a resident of a state, you can vote, assuming, that is, you are not a felon. Seems about right. After all, the United States prides itself on being a democracy, or a government in which the ultimate authority lies with the citizens of the nation. But it was not always this way. In 1789, George Washington won the electoral college with 100% of the vote, but whose vote was it? Probably not yours. Only 6% of the entire United States population was allowed to vote at all. Voting was a right that only white, male property owners were allowed to exercise. By the 1820s and 1830s, the American population was booming from the east coast into the western frontier. Frontier farmers were resilient, self-reliant, and mostly ineligible to vote because they did not own land. As these new areas of the nation became states, they typically left out the property requirement for voting. Leaders such as Andrew Jackson, the United State's first common man President, promoted what he called universal suffrage. Of course, by universal suffrage, Jackson really meant universal white, male suffrage. All he emphasized was getting rid of the property requirement for voting, not expanding the vote beyond white men. By the 1850s, about 55% of the adult population was eligible to vote in the U.S., much better than 6%, but far from everybody. Then, in 1861, the American Civil War began largely over the issue of slavery and states' rights in the United States. When it was all over, the U.S. ratified the 15th Amendment, which promised that a person's right to vote could not be denied based on race, color, or previous condition as a slave. This meant that black men, newly affirmed as citizens of the U.S., would now be allowed to vote. Of course, laws are far from reality. Despite the promise of the 15th Amendment, intimidation kept African-Americans from exercising their voting rights. States passed laws that limited the rights of African-Americans to vote, including things like literacy tests, which were rigged so that not even literate African-Americans were allowed to pass, and poll taxes. So, despite the 15th Amendment, by 1892, only about 6% of black men in Mississippi were registered to vote. By 1960, it was only 1%. And, of course, women were still totally out of the national voting picture. It wasn't until 1920 that the women's suffrage movement won their 30-year battle, and the 19th Amendment finally gave women the vote, well, white women. The restrictions on African-Americans, including African-American women, remained. After World War II, many Americans began to question the state of U.S. democracy.

**Transcript**:
Water is the liquid of life. We drink it, we bathe in it, we farm, cook, and clean with it. It's the most abundant molecule in our bodies. In fact, every life form we know of would die without it. But most importantly, without water, we wouldn't have iced tea. Mmmm, iced tea. Why do these ice cubes float? If these were cubes of solid argon in a cup of liquid argon, they would sink. And the same goes for most other substances. But solid water, a.k.a. ice, is somehow less dense than liquid water. How's that possible? You already know that every water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. Let's look at a few of the molecules in a drop of water, and let's say the temperature is 25 degrees Celcius. The molecules are bending, stretching, spinning, and moving through space. Now, let's lower the temperature, which will reduce the amount of kinetic energy each of these molecules has so they'll bend, stretch, spin, and move less. And that means that on average, they'll take up less space. Now, you'd think that as the liquid water starts to freeze, the molecules would just pack together more and more closely, but that's not what happens. Water has a special kind of interaction between molecules that most other substances don't have, and it's called a hydrogen bond. Now, remember that in a covalent bond two electrons are shared, usually unequally, between atoms. In a hydrogen bond, a hydrogen atom is shared, also unequally, between atoms. One hydrogen bond looks like this. Two look like this. Here's three and four and five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, I could go on. In a single drop of water, hydrogen bonds form extended networks between hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, trillions of molecules, and these bonds are constantly breaking and reforming. Now, back to our water as it cools down. Above 4 degrees Celcius, the kinetic energy of the water molecules keeps their interactions with each other short. Hydrogen bonds form and break like high school relationships, that is to say, quickly. But below 4 degrees, the kinetic energy of the water molecules starts to fall below the energy of the hydrogen bonds. So, hydrogen bonds form much more frequently than they break and beautiful structures start to emerge from the chaos. This is what solid water, ice, looks like on the molecular level. Notice that the ordered, hexagonal structure is less dense than the disordered structure of liquid water. And you know that if an object is less dense than the fluid it's in, it will float. So, ice floats on water, so what? Well, let's consider a world without floating ice. The coldest part of the ocean would be the pitch-black ocean floor, once frozen, always frozen. Forget lobster rolls since crustaceans would lose their habitats, or sushi since kelp forests wouldn't grow. What would Canadian kids do in winter without pond hockey or ice fishing? And forget James Cameron's Oscar because the Titanic totally would have made it. Say goodbye to the white polar ice caps reflecting sunlight that would otherwise bake the planet. In fact, forget the oceans as we know them, which at over 70% of the Earth's surface area, regulate the atmosphere of the whole planet. But worst of all, there would be no iced tea. Mmmmm, iced tea.

**Transcript**:
Water is the liquid of life. We drink it, we bathe in it, we farm, cook, and clean with it. It's the most abundant molecule in our bodies. In fact, every life form we know of would die without it. But most importantly, without water, we wouldn't have iced tea. Mmmm, iced tea. Why do these ice cubes float? If these were cubes of solid argon in a cup of liquid argon, they would sink. And the same goes for most other substances. But solid water, a.k.a. ice, is somehow less dense than liquid water. How's that possible? You already know that every water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. Let's look at a few of the molecules in a drop of water, and let's say the temperature is 25 degrees Celcius. The molecules are bending, stretching, spinning, and moving through space. Now, let's lower the temperature, which will reduce the amount of kinetic energy each of these molecules has so they'll bend, stretch, spin, and move less. And that means that on average, they'll take up less space. Now, you'd think that as the liquid water starts to freeze, the molecules would just pack together more and more closely, but that's not what happens. Water has a special kind of interaction between molecules that most other substances don't have, and it's called a hydrogen bond. Now, remember that in a covalent bond two electrons are shared, usually unequally, between atoms. In a hydrogen bond, a hydrogen atom is shared, also unequally, between atoms. One hydrogen bond looks like this. Two look like this. Here's three and four and five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, I could go on. In a single drop of water, hydrogen bonds form extended networks between hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, trillions of molecules, and these bonds are constantly breaking and reforming. Now, back to our water as it cools down. Above 4 degrees Celcius, the kinetic energy of the water molecules keeps their interactions with each other short. Hydrogen bonds form and break like high school relationships, that is to say, quickly. But below 4 degrees, the kinetic energy of the water molecules starts to fall below the energy of the hydrogen bonds. So, hydrogen bonds form much more frequently than they break and beautiful structures start to emerge from the chaos. This is what solid water, ice, looks like on the molecular level. Notice that the ordered, hexagonal structure is less dense than the disordered structure of liquid water. And you know that if an object is less dense than the fluid it's in, it will float. So, ice floats on water, so what? Well, let's consider a world without floating ice. The coldest part of the ocean would be the pitch-black ocean floor, once frozen, always frozen. Forget lobster rolls since crustaceans would lose their habitats, or sushi since kelp forests wouldn't grow. What would Canadian kids do in winter without pond hockey or ice fishing? And forget James Cameron's Oscar because the Titanic totally would have made it. Say goodbye to the white polar ice caps reflecting sunlight that would otherwise bake the planet. In fact, forget the oceans as we know them, which at over 70% of the Earth's surface area, regulate the atmosphere of the whole planet. But worst of all, there would be no iced tea. Mmmmm, iced tea.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Most atoms don't ride solo, instead they bond with other atoms. And bonds can form between atoms of the same element or atoms of different elements. You've probably imagined bonding as a tug of war. If one atom is really strong, it can pull one or more electrons off another atom. Then you end up with one negatively charged ion and one positively charged ion. And the attraction between these opposite charges is called an ionic bond. This is the kind of sharing where you just give away your toy to someone else and then never get it back. Table salt, sodium chloride, is held together by ionic bonds. Every atom of sodium gives up one electron to every atom of chlorine, ions are formed, and those ions arrange themselves in a 3D grid called a lattice, in which every sodium ion is bonded to six chloride ions, and every chloride ion is bonded to six sodium ions. The chlorine atoms never give the sodium atoms their electrons back. Now, these transactions aren't always so cut-and-dried. If one atom doesn't completely overwhelm the other, they can actually share each other's electrons. This is like a pot luck where you and a friend each bring a dish and then both of you share both dishes. Each atom is attracted to the shared electrons in between them, and this attraction is called a covalent bond. The proteins and DNA in our bodies, for example, are held together largely by these covalent bonds. Some atoms can covalently bond with just one other atom, others with many more. The number of other atoms one atom can bond with depends on how its electrons are arranged. So, how are electrons arranged? Every atom of a pure, unbonded element is electrically neutral because it contains the same number of protons in the nucleus as it does electrons around the nucleus. And not all of those electrons are available for bonding. Only the outermost electrons, the ones in orbitals furthest from the nucleus, the ones with the most energy, only those participate in bonding. By the way, this applies to ionic bonding too. Remember sodium chloride? Well, the electron that sodium loses is the one furthest from its nucleus, and the orbital that electron occupies when it goes over to chlorine is also the one furthest from its nucleus. But back to covalent bonding. Carbon has four electrons that are free to bond, nitrogen has three, oxygen two. So, carbon is likely to form four bonds, nitrogen three, and oxygen two. Hydrogen only has one electron, so it can only form one bond. In some special cases, atoms can form more bonds than you'd expect, but they better have a really good reason to do so, or things tend to fly apart. Groups of atoms that share electrons covalently with each other are called molecules. They can be small. For example, every molecule of oxygen gas is made up of just two oxygen atoms bonded to each other. Or they could be really, really big. Human chromosome 13 is just two molecules, but each one has over 37 billion atoms. And this neighborhood, this city of atoms, is held together by the humble chemical bond.

Evaluation Prompt:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Most atoms don't ride solo, instead they bond with other atoms. And bonds can form between atoms of the same element or atoms of different elements. You've probably imagined bonding as a tug of war. If one atom is really strong, it can pull one or more electrons off another atom. Then you end up with one negatively charged ion and one positively charged ion. And the attraction between these opposite charges is called an ionic bond. This is the kind of sharing where you just give away your toy to someone else and then never get it back. Table salt, sodium chloride, is held together by ionic bonds. Every atom of sodium gives up one electron to every atom of chlorine, ions are formed, and those ions arrange themselves in a 3D grid called a lattice, in which every sodium ion is bonded to six chloride ions, and every chloride ion is bonded to six sodium ions. The chlorine atoms never give the sodium atoms their electrons back. Now, these transactions aren't always so cut-and-dried. If one atom doesn't completely overwhelm the other, they can actually share each other's electrons. This is like a pot luck where you and a friend each bring a dish and then both of you share both dishes. Each atom is attracted to the shared electrons in between them, and this attraction is called a covalent bond. The proteins and DNA in our bodies, for example, are held together largely by these covalent bonds. Some atoms can covalently bond with just one other atom, others with many more. The number of other atoms one atom can bond with depends on how its electrons are arranged. So, how are electrons arranged? Every atom of a pure, unbonded element is electrically neutral because it contains the same number of protons in the nucleus as it does electrons around the nucleus. And not all of those electrons are available for bonding. Only the outermost electrons, the ones in orbitals furthest from the nucleus, the ones with the most energy, only those participate in bonding. By the way, this applies to ionic bonding too. Remember sodium chloride? Well, the electron that sodium loses is the one furthest from its nucleus, and the orbital that electron occupies when it goes over to chlorine is also the one furthest from its nucleus. But back to covalent bonding. Carbon has four electrons that are free to bond, nitrogen has three, oxygen two. So, carbon is likely to form four bonds, nitrogen three, and oxygen two. Hydrogen only has one electron, so it can only form one bond. In some special cases, atoms can form more bonds than you'd expect, but they better have a really good reason to do so, or things tend to fly apart. Groups of atoms that share electrons covalently with each other are called molecules. They can be small. For example, every molecule of oxygen gas is made up of just two oxygen atoms bonded to each other. Or they could be really, really big. Human chromosome 13 is just two molecules, but each one has over 37 billion atoms. And this neighborhood, this city of atoms, is held together by the humble chemical bond.

**Transcript**:
There's a prevailing attitude that art doesn't matter in the real world. But the study of art can enhance our perception and our ability to translate to others what we see. Those skills are useful. Those skills can save lives. Doctors, nurses, and law enforcement agents can use painting, sculpture, and photography as tools to improve their visual acuity and communication skills, which are critical during investigations and emergencies. If you're treating an injury, investigating a crime scene, or trying to describe either of those things to a colleague, art can make you better at it. Here, imagine you're a seasoned cop or a dedicated doctor, but also imagine you are at a museum and let's look at a painting. Rene Magritte's "Time Transfixed" of 1938 depicts a mysterious and complex interior that invites analysis not unlike that required of a patient's symptoms or the scene of a crime. A miniature train whose origin and destination are unknown is emerging from a fireplace, and the smoke from the locomotive appears to flow up the chimney as if from the fire that is conspicuously absent below. The eeriness of the scene is echoed in the empty living room, enhanced by wood-grain floors and decorative wall moldings to the right of the fireplace. Perched atop the mantelpiece are two candlesticks and a clock. Behind these objects is a large mirror that reveals an empty interior and only a partial reflection of the objects before it. The juxtaposition of the objects surrounding the moving train raises numerous questions for which there seem to be no apparent answers. Did I summarize the painting accurately or leave any details out? It's no big deal if you see something else in a painting, but what if we're both seasoned cops? I call you for back-up. You show up only to realize the two bank robbing ninjas I'd mentioned were actually six bank robbing ninjas with lasers. Close study of art can train viewers to study thoroughly, analyze the elements observed, articulate them succinctly, and formulate questions to address the seeming inconsistencies. Scrutinizing the details of an unfamiliar scene, in this case the work of art, and accurately conveying any observable contradictions is a critically important skill for both people who look at x-rays and those who interrogate suspects. Let's interrogate this painting, shall we? Okay, Magritte, that's quite a little picture you've painted. But why aren't there any train tracks? Why no fire? What happened to the candles? Why doesn't the fireplace have a little tunnel for the train? It just comes straight through the wall. And the clock says it's about quarter to one, but I'm not sure the light that comes through the window at an angle says it's just past noontime. What's this painting all about, anyway? That's when you, my trusty partner, hold me back, then I leave. You give Magritte a cup of coffee and keep grilling him to see if this painting would hold up in court. Viewers can provide a more detailed and accurate description of a situation by articulating what is seen and what is not seen. This is particularly important in medicine. If an illness is evidenced by three symptoms and only two are present in a patient, a medical professional must explicitly state the absence of that third symptom, signifying that the patient may not have the condition suspected. Articulating the absence of a specific detail or behavior known as the pertinent negative is as critical as stating the details and behaviors that are present in order to treat the patient. And conspicuous absences are only conspicuous to eyes trained to look for them. Art teaches professionals across a wide spectrum of fields not only how to ask more effective questions about what cannot be readily answered, but also, and more importantly, how to analyze complex, real world situations from a new and different perspective, ultimately solving difficult problems. Intense attention to detail, the ability to take a step back and look differently, we want first responders to have the analytical skills of master art historians at least. Art trains us to investigate, and that's a real world skill if there ever was one.

**Transcript**:
There's a prevailing attitude that art doesn't matter in the real world. But the study of art can enhance our perception and our ability to translate to others what we see. Those skills are useful. Those skills can save lives. Doctors, nurses, and law enforcement agents can use painting, sculpture, and photography as tools to improve their visual acuity and communication skills, which are critical during investigations and emergencies. If you're treating an injury, investigating a crime scene, or trying to describe either of those things to a colleague, art can make you better at it. Here, imagine you're a seasoned cop or a dedicated doctor, but also imagine you are at a museum and let's look at a painting. Rene Magritte's "Time Transfixed" of 1938 depicts a mysterious and complex interior that invites analysis not unlike that required of a patient's symptoms or the scene of a crime. A miniature train whose origin and destination are unknown is emerging from a fireplace, and the smoke from the locomotive appears to flow up the chimney as if from the fire that is conspicuously absent below. The eeriness of the scene is echoed in the empty living room, enhanced by wood-grain floors and decorative wall moldings to the right of the fireplace. Perched atop the mantelpiece are two candlesticks and a clock. Behind these objects is a large mirror that reveals an empty interior and only a partial reflection of the objects before it. The juxtaposition of the objects surrounding the moving train raises numerous questions for which there seem to be no apparent answers. Did I summarize the painting accurately or leave any details out? It's no big deal if you see something else in a painting, but what if we're both seasoned cops? I call you for back-up. You show up only to realize the two bank robbing ninjas I'd mentioned were actually six bank robbing ninjas with lasers. Close study of art can train viewers to study thoroughly, analyze the elements observed, articulate them succinctly, and formulate questions to address the seeming inconsistencies. Scrutinizing the details of an unfamiliar scene, in this case the work of art, and accurately conveying any observable contradictions is a critically important skill for both people who look at x-rays and those who interrogate suspects. Let's interrogate this painting, shall we? Okay, Magritte, that's quite a little picture you've painted. But why aren't there any train tracks? Why no fire? What happened to the candles? Why doesn't the fireplace have a little tunnel for the train? It just comes straight through the wall. And the clock says it's about quarter to one, but I'm not sure the light that comes through the window at an angle says it's just past noontime. What's this painting all about, anyway? That's when you, my trusty partner, hold me back, then I leave. You give Magritte a cup of coffee and keep grilling him to see if this painting would hold up in court. Viewers can provide a more detailed and accurate description of a situation by articulating what is seen and what is not seen. This is particularly important in medicine. If an illness is evidenced by three symptoms and only two are present in a patient, a medical professional must explicitly state the absence of that third symptom, signifying that the patient may not have the condition suspected. Articulating the absence of a specific detail or behavior known as the pertinent negative is as critical as stating the details and behaviors that are present in order to treat the patient. And conspicuous absences are only conspicuous to eyes trained to look for them. Art teaches professionals across a wide spectrum of fields not only how to ask more effective questions about what cannot be readily answered, but also, and more importantly, how to analyze complex, real world situations from a new and different perspective, ultimately solving difficult problems. Intense attention to detail, the ability to take a step back and look differently, we want first responders to have the analytical skills of master art historians at least. Art trains us to investigate, and that's a real world skill if there ever was one.

**Transcript**:
Many elements of traditional Japanese culture, such as cuisine and martial arts, are well-known throughout the world. Kabuki, a form of classical theater performance, may not be as well understood in the West but has evolved over 400 years to still maintain influence and popularity to this day. The word Kabuki is derived from the Japanese verb kabuku, meaning out of the ordinary or bizarre. Its history began in early 17th century Kyoto, where a shrine maiden named Izumo no Okuni would use the city's dry Kamo Riverbed as a stage to perform unusual dances for passerby, who found her daring parodies of Buddhist prayers both entertaining and mesmerizing. Soon other troops began performing in the same style, and Kabuki made history as Japan's first dramatic performance form catering to the common people. By relying on makeup, or keshou, and facial expressions instead of masks and focusing on historical events and everyday life rather than folk tales, Kabuki set itself apart from the upper-class dance theater form known as Noh and provided a unique commentary on society during the Edo period. At first, the dance was practiced only by females and commonly referred to as Onna-Kabuki. It soon evolved to an ensemble performance and became a regular attraction at tea houses, drawing audiences from all social classes. At this point, Onna-Kabuki was often risque as geishas performed not only to show off their singing and dancing abilities but also to advertise their bodies to potential clients. A ban by the conservative Tokugawa shogunate in 1629 led to the emergence of Wakashu-Kabuki with young boys as actors. But when this was also banned for similar reasons, there was a transition to Yaro-Kabuki, performed by men, necessitating elaborate costumes and makeup for those playing female roles, or onnagata. Attempts by the government to control Kabuki didn't end with bans on the gender or age of performers. The Tokugawa military group, or Bakufu, was fueled by Confucian ideals and often enacted sanctions on costume fabrics, stage weaponry, and the subject matter of the plot. At the same time, Kabuki became closely associated with and influenced by Bunraku, an elaborate form of puppet theater. Due to these influences, the once spontaneous, one-act dance evolved into a structured, five-act play often based on the tenets of Confucian philosophy. Before 1868, when the Tokugawa shogunate fell and Emperor Meiji was restored to power, Japan had practiced isolation from other countries, or Sakoku. And thus, the development of Kabuki had mostly been shaped by domestic influences. But even before this period, European artists, such as Claude Monet, had become interested in and inspired by Japanese art, such as woodblock prints, as well as live performance. After 1868, others such as Vincent van Gogh and composer Claude Debussy began to incorporate Kabuki influences in their work, while Kabuki itself underwent much change and experimentation to adapt to the new modern era. Like other traditional art forms, Kabuki suffered in popularity in the wake of World War II. But innovation by artists such as director Tetsuji Takechi led to a resurgence shortly after. Indeed, Kabuki was even considered a popular form of entertainment amongst American troops stationed in Japan despite initial U.S. censorship of Japanese traditions. Today, Kabuki still lives on as an integral part of Japan's rich cultural heritage, extending its influence beyond the stage to television, film, and anime. The art form pioneered by Okuni continues to delight audiences with the actors' elaborate makeup, extravagant and delicately embroidered costumes, and the unmistakable melodrama of the stories told on stage.

It soon evolved to an ensemble performance and became a regular attraction at tea houses, drawing audiences from all social classes. At this point, Onna-Kabuki was often risque as geishas performed not only to show off their singing and dancing abilities but also to advertise their bodies to potential clients. A ban by the conservative Tokugawa shogunate in 1629 led to the emergence of Wakashu-Kabuki with young boys as actors. But when this was also banned for similar reasons, there was a transition to Yaro-Kabuki, performed by men, necessitating elaborate costumes and makeup for those playing female roles, or onnagata. Attempts by the government to control Kabuki didn't end with bans on the gender or age of performers. The Tokugawa military group, or Bakufu, was fueled by Confucian ideals and often enacted sanctions on costume fabrics, stage weaponry, and the subject matter of the plot. At the same time, Kabuki became closely associated with and influenced by Bunraku, an elaborate form of puppet theater. Due to these influences, the once spontaneous, one-act dance evolved into a structured, five-act play often based on the tenets of Confucian philosophy. Before 1868, when the Tokugawa shogunate fell and Emperor Meiji was restored to power, Japan had practiced isolation from other countries, or Sakoku. And thus, the development of Kabuki had mostly been shaped by domestic influences. But even before this period, European artists, such as Claude Monet, had become interested in and inspired by Japanese art, such as woodblock prints, as well as live performance. After 1868, others such as Vincent van Gogh and composer Claude Debussy began to incorporate Kabuki influences in their work, while Kabuki itself underwent much change and experimentation to adapt to the new modern era. Like other traditional art forms, Kabuki suffered in popularity in the wake of World War II. But innovation by artists such as director Tetsuji Takechi led to a resurgence shortly after. Indeed, Kabuki was even considered a popular form of entertainment amongst American troops stationed in Japan despite initial U.S. censorship of Japanese traditions. Today, Kabuki still lives on as an integral part of Japan's rich cultural heritage, extending its influence beyond the stage to television, film, and anime. The art form pioneered by Okuni continues to delight audiences with the actors' elaborate makeup, extravagant and delicately embroidered costumes, and the unmistakable melodrama of the stories told on stage.

**Transcript**:
Many elements of traditional Japanese culture, such as cuisine and martial arts, are well-known throughout the world. Kabuki, a form of classical theater performance, may not be as well understood in the West but has evolved over 400 years to still maintain influence and popularity to this day. The word Kabuki is derived from the Japanese verb kabuku, meaning out of the ordinary or bizarre. Its history began in early 17th century Kyoto, where a shrine maiden named Izumo no Okuni would use the city's dry Kamo Riverbed as a stage to perform unusual dances for passerby, who found her daring parodies of Buddhist prayers both entertaining and mesmerizing. Soon other troops began performing in the same style, and Kabuki made history as Japan's first dramatic performance form catering to the common people. By relying on makeup, or keshou, and facial expressions instead of masks and focusing on historical events and everyday life rather than folk tales, Kabuki set itself apart from the upper-class dance theater form known as Noh and provided a unique commentary on society during the Edo period. At first, the dance was practiced only by females and commonly referred to as Onna-Kabuki. It soon evolved to an ensemble performance and became a regular attraction at tea houses, drawing audiences from all social classes. At this point, Onna-Kabuki was often risque as geishas performed not only to show off their singing and dancing abilities but also to advertise their bodies to potential clients. A ban by the conservative Tokugawa shogunate in 1629 led to the emergence of Wakashu-Kabuki with young boys as actors. But when this was also banned for similar reasons, there was a transition to Yaro-Kabuki, performed by men, necessitating elaborate costumes and makeup for those playing female roles, or onnagata.

**Transcript**:
What if you could only see one color? Imagine, for instance, that you could only see things that were red and that everything else was completely invisible to you. As it turns out, that's how you live your life all the time because your eyes can only see a minuscule part of the full spectrum of light. Different kinds of light are all around you everyday but are invisible to the human eye, from the radio waves that carry your favorite songs, to the x-rays doctors use to see inside of you, to the microwaves that heat up your food. In order to understand how these can all be light, we'll need to know a thing or two about what light is. Light is electromagnetic radiation that acts like both a wave and a particle. Light waves are kind of like waves on the ocean. There are big waves and small waves, waves that crash on the shore one right after the other, and waves that only roll in every so often. The size of a wave is called its wavelength, and how often it comes by is called its frequency. Imagine being a boat in that ocean, bobbing up and down as the waves go by. If the waves that day have long wavelengths, they'll make you bob only so often, or at a low frequency. If the waves, instead, have short wavelengths, they'll be close together, and you'll bob up and down much more often, at a high frequency. Different kinds of light are all waves, they just have different wavelengths and frequencies. If you know the wavelength or frequency of a wave of light, you can also figure out its energy. Long wavelengths have low energies, while short wavelengths have high energies. It's easy to remember if you think about being in that boat. If you were out sailing on a day with short, choppy waves, you'd probably be pretty high energy yourself, running around to keep things from falling over. But on a long wavelength sea, you'd be rolling along, relaxed, low energy. The energy of light tells us how it will interact with matter, for example, the cells of our eyes. When we see, it's because the energy of light stimulates a receptor in our eye called the retina. Our retina are only sensitive to light with a very small range in energy, and so we call that range of light visible light. Inside our retina are special receptors called rods and cones. The rods measure brightness, so we know how much light there is. The cones are in charge of what color of light we see because different cones are sensitive to different energies of light. Some cones are more excited by light that is long wavelength and low energy, and other cones are more excited by short wavelength, high-energy light. When light hits our eye, the relative amount of energy each cone measures signals our brain to perceive colors. The rainbow we perceive is actually visible light in order of its energy. At one side of the rainbow is low-energy light we see as red, and at the other side is high-energy light we see as blue. If light shines on us that has an energy our retina can't measure, we won't be able to see it. Light that is too short wavelength or high energy gets absorbed by the eye's surface before it can even get to the retina, and light that is too long wavelength doesn't have enough energy to stimulate our retina at all. The only thing that makes one kind of light different from another is its wavelength. Radio waves have long wavelengths, while x-rays have short wavelengths. And visible light, the kind you can actually see, is somewhere in between. Even though our eyes can't detect light outside of the visible range, we can build special detectors that are stimulated by these other wavelengths of light, kind of like digital eyes. With these devices, we can measure the light that is there, even though we can't see it ourselves. So, take a step back and think about all of this for a moment. Even though they seem different, the warmth you feel from a crackling fire is the same as the sun shining on you on a beautiful day, the same as ultraviolet light you put on sunscreen to protect yourself from, the same thing as your TV, your radio, and your microwave. Now, those examples are all things here on Earth, things you experience in your everyday life, but here's something even more amazing. Our universe gives off the full spectrum of light, too. When you think of the night sky, you probably think of being able to see the stars shining with your own eyes, but that's just visible light, which you now know is only a tiny part of the full spectrum. If we had to draw the universe and could only use visible light, it would be like having only one crayon -- pretty sad. To see the universe in its full spectrum, we need to have the right eyes, and that means using special telescopes that can help us see beyond visible light. You've probably heard of the Hubble Space Telescope and seen its beautiful pictures taken in visible and ultraviolet light. But you might not know that there are 20 space telescopes in orbit, missions that can each see part of the full spectrum of light. With telescopes acting as our virtual eyes, both in space and here on Earth, we can see some amazing things. And the coolest thing of all, no matter the wavelength or energy, the light that we see out in the distant universe is the same thing as the light that we can experience and study here on Earth. So, since we know the physics of how x-ray, ultraviolet light, or microwaves work here, we can study the light of a distant star or galaxy and know what kinds of things are happening there too. So, as you go about your daily life, think beyond what your eyes can and can't see. Knowing just a little bit about the natural world can help you perceive the full spectrum around you all the time.

Today ,more than half of all people in the world live in an urban area. By mid-century, this will increase to 70%. But as recently as 100 years ago, only two out of ten people lived in a city, and before that, it was even less. How have we reached such a high degree of urbanization, and what does it mean for our future? In the earliest days of human history, humans were hunter-gatherers, often moving from place to place in search of food. But about 10,000 years ago, our ancestors began to learn the secrets of selective breeding and early agricultural techniques. For the first time, people could raise food rather than search for it, and this led to the development of semi-permanent villages for the first time in history. "Why only semi-permanent?" you might ask. Well, at first, the villages still had to relocate every few years as the soil became depleted. It was only with the advent of techniques like irrigation and soil tilling about 5,000 years ago that people could rely on a steady and long-term supply of food, making permanent settlements possible. And with the food surpluses that these techniques produced, it was no longer necessary for everyone to farm. This allowed the development of other specialized trades, and, by extension, cities. With cities now producing surplus food, as well as tools, crafts, and other goods, there was now the possibility of commerce and interaction over longer distances. And as trade flourished, so did technologies that facilitated it, like carts, ships, roads, and ports. Of course, these things required even more labor to build and maintain, so more people were drawn from the countryside to the cities as more jobs and opportunities became available. If you think modern cities are overcrowded, you may be surprised to learn that some cities in 2000 B.C. had population densities nearly twice as high as that of Shanghai or Calcutta. One reason for this was that transportation was not widely available, so everything had to be within walking distance, including the few sources of clean water that existed then. And the land area of the city was further restricted by the need for walls to defend against attacks. The Roman Empire was able to develop infrastructure to overcome these limitations, but other than that, modern cities as we know them, didn't really get their start until the Industrial Revolution, when new technology deployed on a mass scale allowed cities to expand and integrate further, establishing police, fire, and sanitation departments, as well as road networks, and later electricity distribution. So, what is the future of cities? Global population is currently more than 7 billion and is predicted to top out around 10 billion. Most of this growth will occur in the urban areas of the world's poorest countries. So, how will cities need to change to accommodate this growth? First, the world will need to seek ways to provide adequate food, sanitation, and education for all people. Second, growth will need to happen in a way that does not damage the land that provides us with the goods and services that support the human population. Food production might move to vertical farms and skyscrapers, rooftop gardens, or vacant lots in city centers, while power will increasingly come from multiple sources of renewable energy. Instead of single-family homes, more residences will be built vertically. We may see buildings that contain everything that people need for their daily life, as well as a smaller, self-sufficient cities focused on local and sustainable production. The future of cities is diverse, malleable, and creative, no longer built around a single industry, but reflecting an increasingly connected and global world.

**Transcript**:
Today ,more than half of all people in the world live in an urban area. By mid-century, this will increase to 70%. But as recently as 100 years ago, only two out of ten people lived in a city, and before that, it was even less. How have we reached such a high degree of urbanization, and what does it mean for our future? In the earliest days of human history, humans were hunter-gatherers, often moving from place to place in search of food. But about 10,000 years ago, our ancestors began to learn the secrets of selective breeding and early agricultural techniques. For the first time, people could raise food rather than search for it, and this led to the development of semi-permanent villages for the first time in history. "Why only semi-permanent?" you might ask. Well, at first, the villages still had to relocate every few years as the soil became depleted. It was only with the advent of techniques like irrigation and soil tilling about 5,000 years ago that people could rely on a steady and long-term supply of food, making permanent settlements possible. And with the food surpluses that these techniques produced, it was no longer necessary for everyone to farm. This allowed the development of other specialized trades, and, by extension, cities. With cities now producing surplus food, as well as tools, crafts, and other goods, there was now the possibility of commerce and interaction over longer distances. And as trade flourished, so did technologies that facilitated it, like carts, ships, roads, and ports. Of course, these things required even more labor to build and maintain, so more people were drawn from the countryside to the cities as more jobs and opportunities became available. If you think modern cities are overcrowded, you may be surprised to learn that some cities in 2000 B.C. had population densities nearly twice as high as that of Shanghai or Calcutta. One reason for this was that transportation was not widely available, so everything had to be within walking distance, including the few sources of clean water that existed then. And the land area of the city was further restricted by the need for walls to defend against attacks. The Roman Empire was able to develop infrastructure to overcome these limitations, but other than that, modern cities as we know them, didn't really get their start until the Industrial Revolution, when new technology deployed on a mass scale allowed cities to expand and integrate further, establishing police, fire, and sanitation departments, as well as road networks, and later electricity distribution.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine two people are listening to music. What are the odds that they are listening to the exact same playlist? Probably pretty low. After all, everyone has very different tastes in music. Now, what are the odds that your body will need the exact same medical care and treatment as another person's body? Even lower. As we go through our lives, each of us will have very different needs for our own healthcare. Scientists and doctors are constantly researching ways to make medicine more personalized. One way they are doing this is by researching stem cells. Stem cells are cells that are undifferentiated, meaning they do not have a specific job or function. While skin cells protect your body, muscle cells contract, and nerve cells send signals, stem cells do not have any specific structures or functions. Stem cells do have the potential to become all other kinds of cells in your body. Your body uses stem cells to replace worn-out cells when they die. For example, you completely replace the lining of your intestines every four days. Stem cells beneath the lining of your intestines replace these cells as they wear out. Scientists hope that stem cells could be used to create a very special kind of personalized medicine in which we could replace your own body parts with, well, your own body parts. Stem cell researchers are working hard to find ways in which to use stem cells to create new tissue to replace the parts of organs that are damaged by injury or disease. Using stem cells to replace damaged bodily tissue is called regenerative medicine. For example, scientists currently use stem cells to treat patients with blood diseases such as leukemia. Leukemia is a form of cancer that affects your bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside your bones where your blood cells are created. In leukemia, some of the cells inside your bone marrow grow uncontrollably, crowding out the healthy stem cells that form your blood cells. Some leukemia patients can receive a stem cell transplant. These new stem cells will create the blood cells needed by the patient's body. There are actually multiple kinds of stem cells that scientists can use for medical treatments and research. Adult stem cells or tissue-specific stem cells are found in small numbers in most of your body's tissues. Tissue-specific stem cells replace the existing cells in your organs as they wear out and die. Embryonic stem cells are created from leftover embryos that are willingly donated by patients from fertility clinics. Unlike tissue-specific stem cells, embryonic stem cells are pluripotent. This means that they can be grown into any kind of tissue in the body. A third kind of stem cells is called induced pluripotent stem cells. These are regular skin, fat, liver, or other cells that scientists have changed to behave like embryonic stem cells. Like embryonic stem cells, they, too, can become any kind of cell in the body. While scientists and doctors hope to use all of these kinds of stem cells to create new tissue to heal your body, they can also use stem cells to help understand how the body works. Scientists can watch stem cells develop into tissue to understand the mechnanisms that the body uses to create new tissue in a controlled and regulated way. Scientists hope that with more research, they can not only develop specialized medicine that is specific to your body but also better understand how your body functions, both when it's healthy and when it's not.

These new stem cells will create the blood cells needed by the patient's body. There are actually multiple kinds of stem cells that scientists can use for medical treatments and research. Adult stem cells or tissue-specific stem cells are found in small numbers in most of your body's tissues. Tissue-specific stem cells replace the existing cells in your organs as they wear out and die. Embryonic stem cells are created from leftover embryos that are willingly donated by patients from fertility clinics. Unlike tissue-specific stem cells, embryonic stem cells are pluripotent. This means that they can be grown into any kind of tissue in the body. A third kind of stem cells is called induced pluripotent stem cells. These are regular skin, fat, liver, or other cells that scientists have changed to behave like embryonic stem cells. Like embryonic stem cells, they, too, can become any kind of cell in the body. While scientists and doctors hope to use all of these kinds of stem cells to create new tissue to heal your body, they can also use stem cells to help understand how the body works. Scientists can watch stem cells develop into tissue to understand the mechnanisms that the body uses to create new tissue in a controlled and regulated way. Scientists hope that with more research, they can not only develop specialized medicine that is specific to your body but also better understand how your body functions, both when it's healthy and when it's not.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine two people are listening to music. What are the odds that they are listening to the exact same playlist? Probably pretty low. After all, everyone has very different tastes in music. Now, what are the odds that your body will need the exact same medical care and treatment as another person's body? Even lower. As we go through our lives, each of us will have very different needs for our own healthcare. Scientists and doctors are constantly researching ways to make medicine more personalized. One way they are doing this is by researching stem cells. Stem cells are cells that are undifferentiated, meaning they do not have a specific job or function. While skin cells protect your body, muscle cells contract, and nerve cells send signals, stem cells do not have any specific structures or functions. Stem cells do have the potential to become all other kinds of cells in your body. Your body uses stem cells to replace worn-out cells when they die. For example, you completely replace the lining of your intestines every four days. Stem cells beneath the lining of your intestines replace these cells as they wear out. Scientists hope that stem cells could be used to create a very special kind of personalized medicine in which we could replace your own body parts with, well, your own body parts. Stem cell researchers are working hard to find ways in which to use stem cells to create new tissue to replace the parts of organs that are damaged by injury or disease. Using stem cells to replace damaged bodily tissue is called regenerative medicine. For example, scientists currently use stem cells to treat patients with blood diseases such as leukemia. Leukemia is a form of cancer that affects your bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside your bones where your blood cells are created. In leukemia, some of the cells inside your bone marrow grow uncontrollably, crowding out the healthy stem cells that form your blood cells. Some leukemia patients can receive a stem cell transplant. These new stem cells will create the blood cells needed by the patient's body. There are actually multiple kinds of stem cells that scientists can use for medical treatments and research. Adult stem cells or tissue-specific stem cells are found in small numbers in most of your body's tissues. Tissue-specific stem cells replace the existing cells in your organs as they wear out and die. Embryonic stem cells are created from leftover embryos that are willingly donated by patients from fertility clinics. Unlike tissue-specific stem cells, embryonic stem cells are pluripotent. This means that they can be grown into any kind of tissue in the body. A third kind of stem cells is called induced pluripotent stem cells.
