**Transcript**:
so here we have a sample of barium so berium is going towards the bottom of the the group two or alkaline metals so this is a rod of barium we've got in here okay so what I'm going to do I'm going to hopefully if I can get the top off it's really hard I've got four pairs of gloves on here um so it's all quite hard everything's very very difficult to move I'm have to put it down for a second barium is a heavy element I believe that this is a sort of beum or and it's really heavy piece of mineral much heavier than you might expect seeing its size and um where'd you go that I found this just lying around when on a walk somewhere I think it may be be him sulfate but I'm not a mineralist so I may be completely wrong but it's a nice piece and I have it as an ornament in my office I'm hoping it'll come out aha there we go so that's the end of our Rod of barium so what we can do um it's barium is quite soft so we should be able to file a little bit of berium off and we do that so we have some berium starting material so we can react it with things and make berium compounds there it is so this is 100 G Rod of barium I don't think we've used too much so they're probably is close on 100 G there because barium is a heavy element it has quite an important medical use because heavy elements scatter x-rays so that if you shine x-rays on a solution or suspension of barium it looks black and because the x-rays don't go through so if you want to take pictures of the soft part of somebody's body it's easy to take pictures of their bones but if you want to look at their gut or their um throat or their intestin SS they don't show up on x-rays so you feed them what is called a Barian meal if they take it through their mouth or a barium enema if they take it through the other end and you pump in quite large quantities of some barium salt and then when you X-ray them the part that's filled up or just has been coated with it looks black or white if you look at the X-ray and negative which people quite often do so it's very useful for a fairly straightforward x-ray Imaging of people's bodies have you ever had a Barian meal fortunately not it's not meant to taste very nice I think they put peppermint or something into it to pretend that you're enjoying it but drinking a large quantity of berium I think is not enormous fun and people use berium because it's really non-toxic if you took that amount of lead or Mercury you might get a better a picture but you'd be dead so what we should be able to do hopefully cuz this barium is soft we should be able to file a little bit of the barium onto this foil this is what I'm hoping to do let's see if I'm a girly girl now oh I can see little bits coming off actually they're very very small so they're very that was a bigger bit so I'll show you this again in a in a minute but you can see how we're kind of starting to clean off the surface so we're kind of taking that tarnish layer off many elements suddenly become fashionable and in the 1980s late 1980s barium became fashionable as one of the components of the so-called high temperature superconductors a superconductor is a material which has zero electrical resistance and people discovered that a compounds of barium yum and copper barium yum cuprate and related comp compounds when they were cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature 77° absolute minus 196 CRA became superconductors o apart from shaky hands so I've got hopefully some very sort of fine barium turnings now so you can see that okay we have a little bit of tarnish in there but also they we have you know quite a shiny Lester as well on some of the bits so there's my berium nitrate and again I'm going to add some of my combustion mixture now we're using the energy of that combustion of the sugar to excite the barium so that we can observe its emission spectrum or the flame test color again pour it out onto a heat proof mat so again so this time again we saw the same exciting chemical reaction we saw that same exothermic reaction lots of CO2 lots of steam again but this time the flame was colored green and this is the the characteristic apple green which is associated with barium salts so much more exciting flame test all the elements in this group group two have fluorides that are insoluble and they're very nice materials they look like glass and you can put them in water and they don't dissolve and this is extremely useful for technique called infrared spectroscopy where you're putting essentially heat Rays through some sort of liquid to measure the Spectrum how the light is absorbed and especially if you're using water or something that's wet salts of calcium fluoride barium fluoride are really good for making the windows here's quite a large window you can see my eye through it this one unfortunately is cracked so it's no use anymore this is calcium fluoride and calcium fluoride is much cheaper than barium fluoride so if you can get away with it you use calcium fluoride for an experiment the problem is that calcium ions are quite light and the fluoride and calcium ions vibrate in the crystal through thermal energy and these vibrations absorb infrared light barium is much heavier so barium fluoride vibrates more slowly and so it absorbs much longer wavelength light so in a particular experiment if you need to get that region of a spectrum you have to go for barium fluoride instead I tried calling one of my colleagues in the other office see if you had a piece of barium fluoride a barium fluoride window can't find it so you can see calcium fluoride Barum fluoride will look exactly the same but honestly makes us say this is not baring fluoride so we have this one Big Blob and we have the finally divided barium as well okay we're going to try and put that in water and and see how it reacts okay so what's happening is we are seeing um the barium reacting with the water I think our Big Blob is still going actually so the barium is reacting with the water what we're doing is producing hydrogen gas and what I think is probably berium hydroxide um so that's what's precipitating out of solution

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the professor's guess of the composition of the heavy white mineral he found on a walk. The closest generated MCQ is not available, but Question 5 mentions barium fluoride, and Question 6 compares barium fluoride with calcium fluoride.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose none of them, as none of them match the intent or content of the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I can try to find a generated MCQ that mentions barium and a compound. In that case, I would choose Question 5, but please note that this is a very weak match.

Answer: Not Available (or 5, if you insist on an answer)

What’s the next element? Hassium. I know nothing about hassium, shall
we make something up? Hassium is an element which I knew nothing
about. But now I discover it’s much more interesting than I thought. We’re here in
the German state of Hesse at the institute GSI were hassium was first made in 1984. Hassia
is the Latin name for this part of Germany Hesse and hence it is named after the place
it was discovered. So down here we have the accelerator that accelerated atoms of iron
to bang into a lead target to make element 108 Hassium. Element 108 is actually in the
same group of the periodic table as iron, that much I knew when I first talked about
it. But what I didn’t realise is that the element has a few atoms that are long enough
lived that you can really do chemistry. So once the atom flies off from the back of the
target when it has been created you can pass it through an atmosphere of oxygen and make
the oxide hassium tetroxide Hs04. And the iron of this molecule, this oxide can then
be followed to see how volatile it is and compared with osmium tetroxide. Osmium tetroxide
is a white solid which is quite volatile, it easily evaporates and you can show that
hassium tetroxide does not evaporate quite so easily. But it’s amazing this is an element
only forty atoms have been made but you can tell how its oxide behaves. Osmium has one
of the highest melting points of any element that’s known. The people who make periodic
tables where you have a sample of each element have great trouble melting osmium to make
a sample, so it may be that hassium would have an even higher melting point, it could
be that it’s the highest melting point in the periodic table. But one would have to
make a lot more atoms than that if you were going to find out what the melting point was.
I think people may be able to calculate it, but the melting point depends on the strength
of the interaction between the atoms and unless you have quite a few atoms that’s very difficult
to measure. And quite a few means many tens of millions because even a small particle,
a so called nanoparticle, of metal can have quite different properties from a large lump.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Which atoms were accelerated at a lead target, in the accelerator the professor showed us at GSI?
Options: A. Iron, B. Ruthenium, C. Osmium
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQs**:
Question 1: Where was hassium first made? Options: A. In a laboratory in the United States, B. In the German state of Hesse at the institute GSI, C. In a factory in China, D. In a research center in France Correct Option: None
Question 2: What is the Latin name for the German state of Hesse? Options: A. Germania, B. Hassia, C. Europa, D. Allemagne Correct Option: None
Question 3: What is the name of the accelerator that accelerated atoms of iron to make element 108? Options: A. Particle accelerator, B. Atom smasher, C. Lead accelerator, D. Not mentioned in the transcript Correct Option: None
Question 4: What is the name of the oxide of hassium? Options: A. Hassium dioxide, B. Hassium tetroxide, C. Hassium pentoxide, D. Hassium hexoxide Correct Option: None
Question 5: What is the name of the element that hassium tetroxide is compared with? Options: A. Osmium, B. Iron, C. Copper, D. Gold Correct Option: None
Question 6: What is a notable property of osmium tetroxide? Options: A. It is highly volatile, B. It is a white solid, C. It has a low melting point, D. It is highly reactive Correct Option: None
Question 7: What is a possible property of hassium? Options: A. It has a low melting point, B. It has a high melting point, C. It is highly reactive, D. It is highly volatile Correct Option: None
Question 8: Why is it difficult to measure the melting point of an element? Options: A. Because it is a complex process, B. Because it depends on the strength of the interaction between the atoms, C. Because it requires a lot of equipment, D. Because it is a rare property Correct Option: None
Question 9: What is a nanoparticle? Options: A. A small particle of metal, B. A large particle of metal, C. A particle of a non-metal, D. A particle of a gas Correct Option: None
Question 10: How many atoms of hassium have been made? Options: A. A few hundred, B. A few thousand, C. A few tens of millions, D. A few billion Correct Option: None

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the information in the transcript, a similar question can be identified.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the atoms that were accelerated at a lead target in the accelerator at GSI. The correct answer is iron.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 mentions the acceleration of atoms of iron to make element 108, but it asks about the name of the accelerator, which is not the same as the ground truth MCQ.

However, if we consider the content and intent of the questions, Question 3 is the closest match, as it mentions the acceleration of iron atoms, which is the key information in the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 3.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 4 does not ask about the oxidation state of hassium, but rather the name of the oxide of hassium, it's not a perfect match.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the properties or behavior of hassium, specifically its oxidation state. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the oxidation state of hassium.

That being said, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content and intent, I would choose Question 4, as it is related to the properties of hassium.

**Transcript**:
So here, this is a really quite unusual sample
from Goodfellow and you see this is samarium, so this is one of the
lanthanides. Ok so samarium is a beautiful element to work
with as it can change what we refer to as oxidation states very
easily which gives it many more things it can do in chemistry. It’s
also a fascinating element in the sense that we can use it to date samples from
the moon. So this is a sample of samarium and there’s
is a very small amount of it here, perhaps half of a gram. But you know
there's some interesting things we can see about this package because
we can see on this label it says “packed in argon – handle with care.”
Now it’s packed in argon because argon is very, very inert, it doesn’t
react with anything, so it’s used to store, safely, this sample so that
we can get it to carry out research. But I think that this sample has
perhaps become damaged because, I think, the packets maybe broken
because the samarium is gone and all you can see there inside is this
white powder which, I suspect, is samarium oxide, so unfortunately
not elemental samarium, but close. Samarium is also very important because it’s
a neutron absorber, which means it’s got a lot of use in nuclear
power stations. Basically to stop them going ‘boom’.

So this a really beautiful sample of chromium.
So chromium is a transition metal, right in the middle of the transition metals series
there and it is used to protect metal components and very often you see chromium plated components
on cars perhaps some of the older cars, you know, the wheel trims or perhaps the grills
on the front, but if you look at the sample it is really lustrous, really beautiful and
shiny. So there are some elements that one is really
fond of and chromium is one of the metals that I really like. It is a metal you would
have seen it in many places it is used for plating materials. This may actually be stainless steel but chromium
looks very similar and it was very popular for plating bumpers, all sorts of materials
in the 1930s up to the 1950s. So you can get dull chromium as well which
is where the surface is very bumpy and the light tends to be absorbed a lot more and
not reflected. My interest in chromium is that in the chemistry
one of the very first bits of chemistry research I did in school was involving copper chromate.
I spent months doing experiments on it. I did not really discover anything about it
but it was great fun. At one stage I had a whole row of test tubes of copper chromate
above my bed and my bedroom at home and more recently when I starting doing doctorates,
I did experiments with chromium, making new complexes of chromium and one of the very
first compounds that my research group ever made, that was new that nobody else had made
before, was a compound of ethene and chromium  - chromium pentacarbonyl ethene so I have
very warm feelings about it.

[Music] [Applause] thank you very much please excuse me for sitting I'm very old well the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is in a certain sense very peculiar because it's very old roughness is part of human life forever and forever and ancient authors have written about it it was very much on controllable and in a certain sense it seemed to be the extreme of complexity just a mess a mess a mess the many different kinds of a mess now in fact by complete fluke I got involved many years ago in the study of this form of complexity and to my utter amazement I found traces very strong cases i'ma say of order in that roughness and so today I would like to present to you a few of examples of what this represents I prefer to the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity - somebody had had Latin in my long past use means the country of regularity but it is not so regularity is a country of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough so let me show you a few objects some of them artificial other of them very real in a certain sense and now this video is a cauliflower now wider short cauliflower a very ordinary an ancient vegetable because all the ancient as maybe it's very complicated and it's very simple both the same time if you try to wait of course is very easy to wait and I eat it than the way it matters but suppose suppose you try to measure its surface well it's very interesting if you'd cut with short knife one of the florets electron flower and look additi separately you think whole cauliflower was smaller and then you cut again again again again again again again again and still gets more cauliflower so the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property that each part is like the whole but smaller now what did you want to do with that very very little so what I did actually stoom is to study the this this problem and found something quite quite surprising that one can measure roughness by number number two point three one point two and sometimes much more when one day a friend of mine to bug me he brought the pictures it what is the roughness of this this curve I said well just short of one point five was 1.48 now it didn't in any time I've been looking at these things for so long so these numbers are the numbers usually denoted the roughness of the these surfaces hasten to say that each surface is completely artificial done on a computer and the only input is a number and that number is roughness and so on the left I took it the roughness copied from many landscapes to the right I took a higher roughness so the eye after a while can distinguish these two very well humanity had to learn about measuring roughness this is very rough and this is sort of smooth and is perfectly smooth very few pieces are very smooth so then he'll try to to ask questions how was surface a cauliflower well you you measure a measure measure each term look closer it gets bigger down to very very small distances what's the length of coastline of the legs the closer to measure the longer it is the concept of length across line which seems to be so natural because it's given in many places is in fact from fallacy there's no such thing you must do it differently what good is that to know these things well surprisingly enough is good in many ways to begin with especially landscapes which I invented sort of are used in in cinema all the time we see motifs in distance they may be mountains but they may be just formula just blanked on now it's very easy to do it was used to be very time-consuming but now it's nothing now look at that that's real longer now along with something very strange if you take this thing you know very well it weighs very little the volume of a long is very small but what about the area of the lung anatomist were arguing very much about that some said that normal normal males long has an area inside of a basketball and the other said no five basketballs enormous disagreements why so because in fact the area of the lung is something very ill-defined the the bronchi branch from a tree branch and the branch not because in the stop branching not because of of any matter of principle but because of physical concept consideration democracy which is in the longer so what happens is that way we have much bigger long but if it's branches the branches down to distance is about the same for well for man and for a little rodent so now what good is it to have that well surprisingly enough amazingly enough the anatomist had a very poor idea of the structure of the long until very recently and I think that my mathematics surprisingly enough has been a great help to them to the surgeons studying along illnesses and also kidney illnesses all these branching systems which were for which Tourneau geometry so I found myself in other words constructing a geometry a geometry of things which had no geometry and surprising as the it is that very often the rules of this geometry are extremely short you have formulas that long any client it several times sometimes repeatedly again again again the same a petition and at the end you get things like that this cloud is completely 100% artificial well ninety nine point nine and the only part which is natural is a number the roughness of the cloud which is taken from nature something so complicated cloud so unstable so varying should have a simple rule behind it now the simple rule doesn't is not exponential cloud and the sea of clouds had to take account of it I don't know how how it much had advanced these pictures are the old I was very much involved in it but then turn my attention to other phenomena now here is another thing which is rather interesting one of the shattering events in the history of mathematics which is not appreciated by many people occurred about ten thirty years ago around forty five years ago mathematicians began to create shapes that didn't exist mathematicians brought into into self-praise an extent which was absolutely amazing that man can invent things that nature did not know in particular it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane curve the curve a plane the plane and to won't mix well they do mix a man named piano did define such curves and it became an object of extraordinary interest it's very important but mostly interest because a kind of break a separation between the mathematics coming from reality on the one hand a numismatist coming from pure minds mind well I was very sorry to point out that the pure my man's mind has in fact seen at long last what had been seen for a long time and so here I introduce something the set of rivers of a plane filling curve and well it's a story unto itself so it was in 1825 825 an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepares itself to break out from the world and the objects which were used as examples when I was a child and an A student as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality those objects I turned them completely around I use them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature when a man named hausdorff in 1919 introduced a number which was a just mathematical joke and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness when I first told my friends in mathematics I said oh don't don't be silly it's just something well actually I was city gate painter hawks I knew it very well the things on the ground are algin he did not know the mathematics it didn't exist and he was Japanese we didn't have no contact with the West but painting for a long time had the flat side that we speak of that for a long time the Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect and I read the book that mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood this is a mess mess mess Brian loop one day I decided halfway through my career I was helped by so many things in my work I decided to test myself could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something geometrically new well as I looked at at this at this same Cobra emotion just goes around I made it I played with it for a while that may return to the origin then I was telling my assistant I don't see anything can you paint it so he painted it which means that he put inside everything so when this thing came artist stop stop stop I see it in Island and then amazing so Brian motion which happens to have roughly so number who goes around I measured it 1.33 again again again long measurements big bowel motions 1.33 mathematical problem how to prove it it took my friends 20 years three of them were having incomplete proofs they brought together and together had the proof so they got a big metal mathematics one of the three metals that people received for proving things we should have seen without being able to prove them now everybody had asked at one point another how did it all start what brought you in that strange business what brought you to be at the same time a mechanical engineer geographer a mathematician and so on a physicist well actually I started oddly enough studying stock market prices and so here I had this table to this theory and I wrote books about it financial crises increments to the left you see data over long periods with the right on that on top you see a theory which is very very fashionable it was very easy you can write many books very fast about it so the top traveling's of books on that now compare that with the real price increments and when a real price increments well these other lines includes some real price increments and some forgeries chart data so the idea there was that one must be able to undo to how to say a model price variation and it went see me well fifty years ago for 50 years people were sort of pulling this because they would do it much much much easier but I tell you at this point people listen to me this these two curves are averages thunder and poor the blue one and the red one is standard pour from which the five biggest discontinuities are are taken out now the spot annuities are a nuisance so in all of many studies of prices one push them aside well Axelrod and you have little nonsense which is left the Axelrod on this picture as are five Axelrod are as important and everything else in other words it is not Axelrod that we should put aside that is the meet the problem if you master these you master price and if you don't master this you can master the noise as well as you can but it's not important well here are the curves for it now I get the final thing which is the set of which which my name attached them in anyway it's a story of my life my adolescence was spent the German occupation of France and since I thought that I might may vanish within a day or the week I had very big dreams and after the war I saw an uncle again my own clothes very prominent a magician he told me look there's a problem which I could not solve twenty-five years ago and which nobody had to solve this is construction of man named Julia and number two if you could if you could find something new anything he will get your career mail very simple so I looked and like the thousands of people are try before I found nuttin but then the computer came and I decided to apply computer not to new problems mathematics like this legal because that were new problem to old problems and that went from what's called real numbers which two points online to imagine complex numbers which are points in the plane which is what one should do there and this shape came out this shape is of an extraordinary complication the equation is sittin there Z goes into the square plus C it's so simple so drive is so unint sting now you turn the crank one twice twice Marvel's come out I mean this comes out III don't want to explain these things this comes out this comes out shapes which are of such complication such harmony and such beauty this comes out repeatedly again again again and that was one of my major discoveries to find that these islands were the same as a whole big thing more or less and then you get these extra neighbor oak decoration all over the place all that from this little formula which have has whatever five symbols in it and then this one the color was added for two reasons first of all because these shapes are so complicated that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers and if you plot them you must choose some system and so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that another has data on that it's so complicated in 1990 I was in famous you came to see a prize from the University and a few days later a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing so where did it come from obviously from the extra-terrestrial well so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that discovery and received the next day 5,000 letters from people saying but that's simply Mandelbrot set is very big well let me finish this shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics bottomless wonders spring from simple rules which are repeated without end thank you very much [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

The ground truth MCQ is about anatomists arguing about the area of a certain organ, which is the lung. Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is about the property of a cauliflower, which is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 3 does mention the concept of "each part is like the whole but smaller," which is a fractal property that can be applied to the structure of the lung.

Although there is no direct match, I would suggest that Question 3 is the closest generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ, based on the topic of fractals and self-similarity.

if it's branches the branches down to distance is about the same for well for man and for a little rodent so now what good is it to have that well surprisingly enough amazingly enough the anatomist had a very poor idea of the structure of the long until very recently and I think that my mathematics surprisingly enough has been a great help to them to the surgeons studying along illnesses and also kidney illnesses all these branching systems which were for which Tourneau geometry so I found myself in other words constructing a geometry a geometry of things which had no geometry and surprising as the it is that very often the rules of this geometry are extremely short you have formulas that long any client it several times sometimes repeatedly again again again the same a petition and at the end you get things like that this cloud is completely 100% artificial well ninety nine point nine and the only part which is natural is a number the roughness of the cloud which is taken from nature something so complicated cloud so unstable so varying should have a simple rule behind it now the simple rule doesn't is not exponential cloud and the sea of clouds had to take account of it I don't know how how it much had advanced these pictures are the old I was very much involved in it but then turn my attention to other phenomena now here is another thing which is rather interesting one of the shattering events in the history of mathematics which is not appreciated by many people occurred about ten thirty years ago around forty five years ago mathematicians began to create shapes that didn't exist mathematicians brought into into self-praise an extent which was absolutely amazing that man can invent things that nature did not know in particular it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane curve the curve a plane the plane and to won't mix well they do mix a man named piano did define such curves and it became an object of extraordinary interest it's very important but mostly interest because a kind of break a separation between the mathematics coming from reality on the one hand a numismatist coming from pure minds mind well I was very sorry to point out that the pure my man's mind has in fact seen at long last what had been seen for a long time and so here I introduce something the set of rivers of a plane filling curve and well it's a story unto itself so it was in 1825 825 an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepares itself to break out from the world and the objects which were used as examples when I was a child and an A student as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality those objects I turned them completely around I use them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature when a man named hausdorff in 1919 introduced a number which was a just mathematical joke and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness when I first told my friends in mathematics I said oh don't don't be silly it's just something well actually I was city gate painter hawks I knew it very well the things on the ground are algin he did not know the mathematics it didn't exist and he was Japanese we didn't have no contact with the West but painting for a long time had the flat side that we speak of that for a long time the Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect and I read the book that mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood this is a mess mess mess Brian loop one day I decided halfway through my career I was helped by so many things in my work I decided to test myself could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something geometrically new well as I looked at at this at this same Cobra emotion just goes around I made it I played with it for a while that may return to the origin then I was telling my assistant I don't see anything can you paint it so he painted it which means that he put inside everything so when this thing came artist stop stop stop I see it in Island and then amazing so Brian motion which happens to have roughly so number who goes around I measured it 1.33 again again again long measurements big bowel motions 1.33 mathematical problem how to prove it it took my friends 20 years three of them were having incomplete proofs they brought together and together had the proof so they got a big metal mathematics one of the three metals that people received for proving things we should have seen without being able to prove them now everybody had asked at one point another how did it all start what brought you in that strange business what brought you to be at the same time a mechanical engineer geographer a mathematician and so on a physicist well actually I started oddly enough studying stock market prices and so here I had this table to this theory and I wrote books about it financial crises increments to the left you see data over long periods with the right on that on top you see a theory which is very very fashionable it was very easy you can write many books very fast about it so the top traveling's of books on that now compare that with the real price increments and when a real price increments well these other lines includes some real price increments and some forgeries chart data so the idea there was that one must be able to undo to how to say a model price variation and it went see me well fifty years ago for 50 years people were sort of pulling this because they would do it much much much easier but I tell you at this point people listen to me this these two curves are averages thunder and poor the blue one and the red one is standard pour from which the five biggest discontinuities are are taken out now the spot annuities are a nuisance so in all of many studies of prices one push them aside well Axelrod and you have little nonsense which is left the Axelrod on this picture as are five Axelrod are as important and everything else in other words it is not Axelrod that we should put aside that is the meet the problem if you master these you master price and if you don't master this you can master the noise as well as you can but it's not important well here are the curves for it now I get the final thing which is the set of which which my name attached them in anyway it's a story of my life my adolescence was spent the German occupation of France and since I thought that I might may vanish within a day or the week I had very big dreams and after the war I saw an uncle again my own clothes very prominent a magician he told me look there's a problem which I could not solve twenty-five years ago and which nobody had to solve this is construction of man named Julia and number two if you could if you could find something new anything he will get your career mail very simple so I looked and like the thousands of people are try before I found nuttin but then the computer came and I decided to apply computer not to new problems mathematics like this legal because that were new problem to old problems and that went from what's called real numbers which two points online to imagine complex numbers which are points in the plane which is what one should do there and this shape came out this shape is of an extraordinary complication the equation is sittin there Z goes into the square plus C it's so simple so drive is so unint sting now you turn the crank one twice twice Marvel's come out I mean this comes out III don't want to explain these things this comes out this comes out shapes which are of such complication such harmony and such beauty this comes out repeatedly again again again and that was one of my major discoveries to find that these islands were the same as a whole big thing more or less and then you get these extra neighbor oak decoration all over the place all that from this little formula which have has whatever five symbols in it and then this one the color was added for two reasons first of all because these shapes are so complicated that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers and if you plot them you must choose some system and so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that another has data on that it's so complicated in 1990 I was in famous you came to see a prize from the University and a few days later a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing so where did it come from obviously from the extra-terrestrial well so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that discovery and received the next day 5,000 letters from people saying but that's simply Mandelbrot set is very big well let me finish this shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics bottomless wonders spring from simple rules which are repeated without end thank you very much [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

**Transcript**:
An enduring myth says we use
only 10% of our brain, the other 90% standing idly by
for spare capacity. Hucksters promised to unlock
that hidden potential with methods "based on neuroscience," but all they really unlock is your wallet. Two-thirds of the public
and nearly half of science teachers mistakenly believe the 10% myth. In the 1890s, William James, the father of American psychology, said, "Most of us do not meet
our mental potential." James meant this as a challenge, not an indictment of scant brain usage. But the misunderstanding stuck. Also, scientists couldn't
figure out for a long time the purpose of our massive frontal lobes or broad areas of the parietal lobe. Damage didn't cause motor
or sensory deficits, so authorities concluded
they didn't do anything. For decades, these parts
were called silent areas, their function elusive. We've since learned that they underscore executive and integrative ability, without which, we would hardly be human. They are crucial to abstract reasoning, planning, weighing decisions and flexibly adapting to circumstances. The idea that 9/10 of your brain
sits idly by in your skull looks silly when we calculate
how the brain uses energy. Rodent and canine brains consume 5% of total body energy. Monkey brains use 10%. An adult human brain, which accounts for only 2%
of the body's mass, consumes 20% of daily glucose burned. In children, that figure is 50%, and in infants, 60%. This is far more than expected
for their relative brain sizes, which scale in proportion to body size. Human ones weigh 1.5 kilograms, elephant brains 5 kg, and whale brains 9 kg, yet on a per weight basis, humans pack in more neurons
than any other species. This dense packing
is what makes us so smart. There is a trade-off between body size and the number of neurons a primate, including us, can sustain. A 25 kg ape has to eat 8 hours a day to uphold a brain with 53 billion neurons. The invention of cooking, one and half million years ago, gave us a huge advantage. Cooked food is rendered
soft and predigested outside of the body. Our guts more easily absorb its energy. Cooking frees up time
and provides more energy than if we ate food stuffs raw and so we can sustain brains with 86 billion densely packed neurons. 40% more than the ape. Here's how it works. Half the calories a brain burns go towards simply keeping
the structure intact by pumping sodium and potassium ions across membranes
to maintain an electrical charge. To do this, the brain
has to be an energy hog. It consumes an astounding 3.4 x 10^21 ATP molecules per minute, ATP being the coal of the body's furnace. The high cost of maintaining
resting potentials in all 86 billion neurons means that little energy is left to propel signals down axons
and across synapses, the nerve discharges
that actually get things done. Even if only a tiny percentage of neurons fired in a given region at any one time, the energy burden of generating spikes
over the entire brain would be unsustainable. Here's where energy efficiency comes in. Letting just a small proportion of cells
signal at any one time, known as sparse coding, uses the least energy, but carries the most information. Because the small number of signals have thousands of possible paths
by which to distribute themselves. A drawback of sparse coding
within a huge number of neurons is its cost. Worse, if a big proportion
of cells never fire, then they are superfluous and evolution should have
jettisoned them long ago. The solution is to find
the optimum proportion of cells that the brain can have active at once. For maximum efficiency, between 1% and 16% of cells
should be active at any given moment. This is the energy limit
we have to live with in order to be conscious at all. The need to conserve resources is the reason
most of the brain's operations must happen outside of consciousness. It's why multitasking is a fool's errand. We simply lack the energy
to do two things at once, let alone three or five. When we try, we do each task less well than if we had given it
our full attention. The numbers are against us. Your brain is already smart and powerful. So powerful that it needs
a lot of power to stay powerful. And so smart that it has built in
an energy-efficiency plan. So don't let a fraudulent myth
make you guilty about your supposedly lazy brain. Guilt would be a waste of energy. After all this, don't you realize
it's dumb to waste mental energy? You have billions of
power-hungry neurons to maintain. So hop to it!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What percentage of calories a brain burns goes towards maintaining its structure? 

This question is similar in intent and content to the ground truth MCQ, which asks "To what is most the brain’s energy devoted?" and has the correct option "Maintaining electrical resting potentials." Although the wording is not identical, both questions are asking about the primary use of the brain's energy.

However, it's worth noting that the options in Question 5 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the brain's energy usage and has options that include "Maintaining electrical resting potentials" or something similar.

Since there isn't a more accurate match, I will provide the index of Question 5, which is the closest match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of energy and resource utilization in the brain, which is the main theme of the ground truth MCQ.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 7: What is the energy-efficient strategy used by the brain to conserve resources?

Although this question does not directly address the topic of cooking and energy absorption, it does relate to the brain's energy efficiency and resource utilization, which is a broader theme in the transcript.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 7 is the most similar generated MCQ, but with a low confidence score due to the lack of direct matching.

Index: 7

Please note that this is not an ideal match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the topic of cooking and energy absorption, as stated in the ground truth MCQ.

An enduring myth says we use
only 10% of our brain, the other 90% standing idly by
for spare capacity. Hucksters promised to unlock
that hidden potential with methods "based on neuroscience," but all they really unlock is your wallet. Two-thirds of the public
and nearly half of science teachers mistakenly believe the 10% myth. In the 1890s, William James, the father of American psychology, said, "Most of us do not meet
our mental potential." James meant this as a challenge, not an indictment of scant brain usage. But the misunderstanding stuck. Also, scientists couldn't
figure out for a long time the purpose of our massive frontal lobes or broad areas of the parietal lobe. Damage didn't cause motor
or sensory deficits, so authorities concluded
they didn't do anything. For decades, these parts
were called silent areas, their function elusive. We've since learned that they underscore executive and integrative ability, without which, we would hardly be human. They are crucial to abstract reasoning, planning, weighing decisions and flexibly adapting to circumstances. The idea that 9/10 of your brain
sits idly by in your skull looks silly when we calculate
how the brain uses energy. Rodent and canine brains consume 5% of total body energy. Monkey brains use 10%. An adult human brain, which accounts for only 2%
of the body's mass, consumes 20% of daily glucose burned. In children, that figure is 50%, and in infants, 60%. This is far more than expected
for their relative brain sizes, which scale in proportion to body size. Human ones weigh 1.5 kilograms, elephant brains 5 kg, and whale brains 9 kg, yet on a per weight basis, humans pack in more neurons
than any other species. This dense packing
is what makes us so smart. There is a trade-off between body size and the number of neurons a primate, including us, can sustain. A 25 kg ape has to eat 8 hours a day to uphold a brain with 53 billion neurons. The invention of cooking, one and half million years ago, gave us a huge advantage. Cooked food is rendered
soft and predigested outside of the body. Our guts more easily absorb its energy. Cooking frees up time
and provides more energy than if we ate food stuffs raw and so we can sustain brains with 86 billion densely packed neurons. 40% more than the ape. Here's how it works. Half the calories a brain burns go towards simply keeping
the structure intact by pumping sodium and potassium ions across membranes
to maintain an electrical charge. To do this, the brain
has to be an energy hog. It consumes an astounding 3.4 x 10^21 ATP molecules per minute, ATP being the coal of the body's furnace. The high cost of maintaining
resting potentials in all 86 billion neurons means that little energy is left to propel signals down axons
and across synapses, the nerve discharges
that actually get things done. Even if only a tiny percentage of neurons fired in a given region at any one time, the energy burden of generating spikes
over the entire brain would be unsustainable. Here's where energy efficiency comes in. Letting just a small proportion of cells
signal at any one time, known as sparse coding, uses the least energy, but carries the most information. Because the small number of signals have thousands of possible paths
by which to distribute themselves. A drawback of sparse coding
within a huge number of neurons is its cost. Worse, if a big proportion
of cells never fire, then they are superfluous and evolution should have
jettisoned them long ago. The solution is to find
the optimum proportion of cells that the brain can have active at once. For maximum efficiency, between 1% and 16% of cells
should be active at any given moment. This is the energy limit
we have to live with in order to be conscious at all. The need to conserve resources is the reason
most of the brain's operations must happen outside of consciousness. It's why multitasking is a fool's errand. We simply lack the energy
to do two things at once, let alone three or five. When we try, we do each task less well than if we had given it
our full attention. The numbers are against us. Your brain is already smart and powerful. So powerful that it needs
a lot of power to stay powerful. And so smart that it has built in
an energy-efficiency plan. So don't let a fraudulent myth

**Transcript**:
Norman McLaren, the great 20th century pioneer of animation technique, once said, "Animation is not the art of drawings that move, but the art of movements that are drawn. What happens between each frame is more important than what exists on each frame." What did he mean? Well, for an object to appear in motion, it necessarily has to change in position over time. If time passes and no change in position occurs, the object will appear to be still. This relationship between the passage of time and the amount of change that occurs in that time is at the heart of every time-based art form, be it music, dance, or motion pictures. Manipulating the speed and amount of change between the frames is the secret alchemy that gives animation the ability to convey the illusion of life. In animation, there are two fundamental principles we use to do this: timing and spacing. To illustrate the relationship between them, we'll use a timeless example: the bouncing ball. One way to think about timing is that it's the speed, or tempo, at which an action takes place. We determine the speed of an action by how many pictures, or frames, it takes to happen. The more frames something takes to happen, the more time it spends on screen, so the slower the action will be. The fewer frames something takes to happen, the less screen time it takes, which gives us faster action. The timing is about more than just speed, it's also about rhythm. Like a drumbeat or melody only exists when a song is being played, the timing of an action only exists while it's happening. You can describe it in words, say, something will take 6 frames, 18 frames, or so on. But to really get a sense of it, you need to act it out or experience it as it would happen in, well, real time. Now, the timing of an action all depends on the context of the scene and what you're trying to communicate. What is doing the acting, and why? Let's take our example. What makes a ball bounce? The action we're talking about here is a result of interacting physical forces, a moving ball's tendency to stay in motion, or its force of momentum vs. the constant force of gravity bringing it back down Earth. The degree to which these invisible forces apply, and the reason why the ball behaves the way it does, all depends on the physical properties of the ball. A golf ball is small, hard and light. A rubber ball is small, soft and lighter. A beach ball is large, soft and light. And a bowling ball is large, hard and heavy. So, each ball behaves very differently, according to its properties. Let's get a sense of the visual rhythm of each. Each ball plays its own beat and tells us something about itself and the time it takes to travel across the screen. The visual rhythm of these hits is the timing. Okay, let's start animating our ball, bouncing up and down with a simple cycle of drawings. We'll draw a circle here, call it point A, our starting point. We'll have it hit the ground here, point B. Let's say it takes about a second to hit the ground and come back up again. This is our timing. Our spacing is where we position the circle in the frames between point A and point B. If we were to move our ball in evenly-spaced increments, we'd get something like this. It's not really telling us anything about itself. Is it a bouncing ball or a circle on an elevator? Let's look at our footage again and think about what's going on as each ball bounces. Following each impact with the ground, the ball's upward momentum is eventually overcome by gravity. This happens at the peak of each arc. As things change direction, the motion is slowest. We see here the successive positions of the ball are close together. The ball then speeds up as it falls, and is at its fastest when it's approaching and hitting the ground. We can see here each position is further apart. The change in position between frames is the spacing. The smaller the change, the slower the action will appear. The greater the change, the faster it will appear. For an action to decelerate, each change in position must be less than the change before it. Likewise, for an action to speed up, or accelerate, each successive change must be greater. Let's change the mechanical spacing of our animated bounce to reflect what we observed in the footage. Slow at the top, fast when it's hitting the ground. Simply by adjusting the spacing, we've succeeded in suggesting the forces of momentum and gravity at play and achieved a much more realistic motion. Same timing but different spacing gives us vastly different results. And in reality, as a ball bounces, the physics of gravity eventually defeat the tendency of the ball to stay in motion. You can see this here in the decreasing height of each successive bounce. However, again, this decrease varies according to the properties of the ball. Even though these circles are the same size here, they're each telling us a different story about themselves, purely in how they move. The relationship between these principles of timing and spacing can be applied in countless ways and used to animate all types of action: a yo-yo, a punch, a gentle tap, a push, a saw, the Sun traveling across the sky, a pendulum. Animation is a time-based art form. It may incorporate the aesthetic elements of other graphic arts, like illustration or painting, but what sets animation apart is that, here, what you see is less important that what you don't see. An object's superficial appearance only tells us so much about itself. It's only when it's in motion that we really understand its nature.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can suggest a related generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about determining the speed of an action in animation. A related generated MCQ is Question 4, which asks about the timing of an action in animation. Although it's not an exact match, it's the closest one in terms of content and intent.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept of "frames" or "pictures" in animation, I would suggest Question 2. It mentions the change in position between frames, which is related to the concept of frames, but it's not directly asking about determining the speed of an action.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept:

Index: 4 (or 2, considering the broader context)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require generating new MCQs that specifically address the concept of determining the speed of an action in animation.

Let's get a sense of the visual rhythm of each. Each ball plays its own beat and tells us something about itself and the time it takes to travel across the screen. The visual rhythm of these hits is the timing. Okay, let's start animating our ball, bouncing up and down with a simple cycle of drawings. We'll draw a circle here, call it point A, our starting point. We'll have it hit the ground here, point B. Let's say it takes about a second to hit the ground and come back up again. This is our timing. Our spacing is where we position the circle in the frames between point A and point B. If we were to move our ball in evenly-spaced increments, we'd get something like this. It's not really telling us anything about itself. Is it a bouncing ball or a circle on an elevator? Let's look at our footage again and think about what's going on as each ball bounces. Following each impact with the ground, the ball's upward momentum is eventually overcome by gravity. This happens at the peak of each arc. As things change direction, the motion is slowest. We see here the successive positions of the ball are close together. The ball then speeds up as it falls, and is at its fastest when it's approaching and hitting the ground. We can see here each position is further apart. The change in position between frames is the spacing. The smaller the change, the slower the action will appear. The greater the change, the faster it will appear. For an action to decelerate, each change in position must be less than the change before it. Likewise, for an action to speed up, or accelerate, each successive change must be greater. Let's change the mechanical spacing of our animated bounce to reflect what we observed in the footage. Slow at the top, fast when it's hitting the ground. Simply by adjusting the spacing, we've succeeded in suggesting the forces of momentum and gravity at play and achieved a much more realistic motion. Same timing but different spacing gives us vastly different results. And in reality, as a ball bounces, the physics of gravity eventually defeat the tendency of the ball to stay in motion. You can see this here in the decreasing height of each successive bounce. However, again, this decrease varies according to the properties of the ball. Even though these circles are the same size here, they're each telling us a different story about themselves, purely in how they move. The relationship between these principles of timing and spacing can be applied in countless ways and used to animate all types of action: a yo-yo, a punch, a gentle tap, a push, a saw, the Sun traveling across the sky, a pendulum. Animation is a time-based art form. It may incorporate the aesthetic elements of other graphic arts, like illustration or painting, but what sets animation apart is that, here, what you see is less important that what you don't see. An object's superficial appearance only tells us so much about itself. It's only when it's in motion that we really understand its nature.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can suggest that Question 4 is the closest match.

Question 4: What does the timing of an action refer to in animation? 
Options: A. The speed at which an action takes place, B. The rhythm of an action, C. The color of an action, D. The movement of an action

Although the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are related to the concept of timing and its effect on the action's speed.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest a combination of Question 4 and the concept presented in the transcript: "The more frames something takes to happen, the more time it spends on screen, so the slower the action will be. The fewer frames something takes to happen, the less screen time it takes, which gives us faster action."

Unfortunately, this exact question is not present in the generated MCQs. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 4 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
Norman McLaren, the great 20th century pioneer of animation technique, once said, "Animation is not the art of drawings that move, but the art of movements that are drawn. What happens between each frame is more important than what exists on each frame." What did he mean? Well, for an object to appear in motion, it necessarily has to change in position over time. If time passes and no change in position occurs, the object will appear to be still. This relationship between the passage of time and the amount of change that occurs in that time is at the heart of every time-based art form, be it music, dance, or motion pictures. Manipulating the speed and amount of change between the frames is the secret alchemy that gives animation the ability to convey the illusion of life. In animation, there are two fundamental principles we use to do this: timing and spacing. To illustrate the relationship between them, we'll use a timeless example: the bouncing ball. One way to think about timing is that it's the speed, or tempo, at which an action takes place. We determine the speed of an action by how many pictures, or frames, it takes to happen. The more frames something takes to happen, the more time it spends on screen, so the slower the action will be. The fewer frames something takes to happen, the less screen time it takes, which gives us faster action. The timing is about more than just speed, it's also about rhythm. Like a drumbeat or melody only exists when a song is being played, the timing of an action only exists while it's happening. You can describe it in words, say, something will take 6 frames, 18 frames, or so on. But to really get a sense of it, you need to act it out or experience it as it would happen in, well, real time. Now, the timing of an action all depends on the context of the scene and what you're trying to communicate. What is doing the acting, and why? Let's take our example. What makes a ball bounce? The action we're talking about here is a result of interacting physical forces, a moving ball's tendency to stay in motion, or its force of momentum vs. the constant force of gravity bringing it back down Earth. The degree to which these invisible forces apply, and the reason why the ball behaves the way it does, all depends on the physical properties of the ball. A golf ball is small, hard and light. A rubber ball is small, soft and lighter. A beach ball is large, soft and light. And a bowling ball is large, hard and heavy. So, each ball behaves very differently, according to its properties. Let's get a sense of the visual rhythm of each. Each ball plays its own beat and tells us something about itself and the time it takes to travel across the screen. The visual rhythm of these hits is the timing. Okay, let's start animating our ball, bouncing up and down with a simple cycle of drawings. We'll draw a circle here, call it point A, our starting point. We'll have it hit the ground here, point B. Let's say it takes about a second to hit the ground and come back up again. This is our timing. Our spacing is where we position the circle in the frames between point A and point B. If we were to move our ball in evenly-spaced increments, we'd get something like this. It's not really telling us anything about itself. Is it a bouncing ball or a circle on an elevator? Let's look at our footage again and think about what's going on as each ball bounces. Following each impact with the ground, the ball's upward momentum is eventually overcome by gravity. This happens at the peak of each arc. As things change direction, the motion is slowest. We see here the successive positions of the ball are close together. The ball then speeds up as it falls, and is at its fastest when it's approaching and hitting the ground. We can see here each position is further apart. The change in position between frames is the spacing. The smaller the change, the slower the action will appear. The greater the change, the faster it will appear. For an action to decelerate, each change in position must be less than the change before it. Likewise, for an action to speed up, or accelerate, each successive change must be greater. Let's change the mechanical spacing of our animated bounce to reflect what we observed in the footage. Slow at the top, fast when it's hitting the ground. Simply by adjusting the spacing, we've succeeded in suggesting the forces of momentum and gravity at play and achieved a much more realistic motion. Same timing but different spacing gives us vastly different results. And in reality, as a ball bounces, the physics of gravity eventually defeat the tendency of the ball to stay in motion. You can see this here in the decreasing height of each successive bounce. However, again, this decrease varies according to the properties of the ball. Even though these circles are the same size here, they're each telling us a different story about themselves, purely in how they move. The relationship between these principles of timing and spacing can be applied in countless ways and used to animate all types of action: a yo-yo, a punch, a gentle tap, a push, a saw, the Sun traveling across the sky, a pendulum. Animation is a time-based art form.

An object's superficial appearance only tells us so much about itself. It's only when it's in motion that we really understand its nature.

**Transcript**:
How fast are you moving right now? That seems like an easy question. The first tempting answer is, "I'm not moving." Upon further reflection, you realize that maybe the Earth's motion counts. So, a second tempting answer is, "19 miles/second around the Sun." But then you recall learning that the Sun moves around the center of the Milky Way galaxy, and the Milky Way moves within the Local Group of galaxies, and the Local Group moves within the Virgo Cluster, and the Virgo Cluster moves within... "How fast are you moving?" is not an easy question. When Mission Control tells astronauts how fast they're going, there's always an assumed standard of rest. At the start of the voyage, speeds are given relative to the launchpad. But later, when the launchpad is just one more arbritrary place down there on Earth's spinning surface, speeds are given relative to the idealized, non-spinning pinpoint center of Earth. On their way to the Moon, Apollo astronauts had a hard time answering the question, "How fast are you moving?" Speed away from Earth was one thing, and speed toward the Moon was quite another. That's because the Earth and the Moon move relative to one another. Ah, of course! Speed is a relative quantity. When Captain Kirk ask Lieutenant Sulu if the Starship Enterprise has reached a speed of warp 7, Sulu should reply,  "Relative to what, Captain?" Such a sassy reply may get subordinate Starfleet officers in trouble, but it is the only good answer to the question, "How fast are you moving?" This is basic relatively talking. Not fancy Einsteinian relativity, but good old fashioned (and still correct) Galilean relativity. Galileo seems to have been the first person to realize that there is no such thing as an absolute speed. Speeds are relative. This means that speeds only have meaning when they are referred to a reference frame. Presumably that reference frame is itself at rest. But then we have to ask again, "At rest relative to what?" Because even the concept of rest has lost any hint of absolute meaning. Speed is relative, and rest is relative. Earth's speed is 19 miles/second relative to the Sun. The Enterprise's speed is warp 7 relative to the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Your speed is zero relative to your easy chair. But depending on where you sit, it is hundreds of miles/hour relative to Earth's center. When we furrow a brow and ask, "But how fast is Earth really moving?" we imagine Spaceship Earth plowing through the ocean of space as it orbits the Sun. But space is not an ocean. It has no substance as water does. Space is not a thing; space is nothing. Space is no thing. You can move between two points in space, say between Earth and Mars, but you can't move through space. There's nothing to move through. It's like trying to say how much a hole weighs. A hole weighs exactly nothing because a hole is nothing. It's a void, and so is space. To move relative to nothing is meaningless. The concepts of speed and of rest have only relative meaning. They are absolutely meaningless. They mean something only with respect to arbitrarily chosen, artificial frames of reference. If, someday, you are buckled into your spaceship, and you see from the side window, say, a space station whizz by at constant speed, there is no way to know which of you is really moving. Neither of you is really moving because there is no deep reality about constant speed. Constant speed in a straight line has only relative meaning, a kind of relative reality. Does this mean that all motion is relative? No! Some motions have only relative meaning, but some motions have absolute meaning, are absolutely real. For example, constant speed is relative, but change in speed is absolute. Calling something absolute in science means that arbitrary standards are not used in its measurement. It is unambiguously measurable. When your spaceship fires its engines, your change in speed is beyond doubt. You feel it in your stomach, and your ship's sensors can measure it. Outside your window, the passing space station may seem to be changing speed, but the beings inside the station will not feel it. And no sensors can measure it. You are really changing speed, and they are really are not. There's something absolutely real about changes in speed. The same goes for rotation. If your spaceship is spinning, you can feel it, and your ship's sensors can measure it. The space station outside may seem to be going around you, but it is you who feels queasy, not the folks in the space station. You are really spinning, and they really are not. There's something absolutely real about rotation. So, some motions are relative, and some are not. There is no deep reality about constant speed, but changes in speed are deeply real, and so are rotations. We have to be thoughtful in our analysis of everyday experience in order to identify what is deeply real. Since we can be fooled by perceptions as basic as speed, maybe every perception deserves careful scrutiny. This is what inspired Einstein to his incredible insights about the speed of light and forward time travel. Knowing how to identify what is deeply real is tough and important work. If a police officer ever pulls you over for speeding and asks, &quot;Do you know how fast you were going?&quot; an insightful, though perhaps unwise, reply would be, "Relative to what?" And then, as you sit in the backseat of the police car and feel it accelerate toward jail, you can add, &quot;But some things are absolute!&quot;

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the reference frame used to measure the speed of Apollo astronauts traveling from Earth to the Moon. The closest generated MCQ that touches on the concept of reference frames is Question 1, which asks about the main idea of Galilean relativity. However, this question does not specifically address the reference frame used for measuring speed.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the reference frame used for measuring speed, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
How fast are you moving right now? That seems like an easy question. The first tempting answer is, "I'm not moving." Upon further reflection, you realize that maybe the Earth's motion counts. So, a second tempting answer is, "19 miles/second around the Sun." But then you recall learning that the Sun moves around the center of the Milky Way galaxy, and the Milky Way moves within the Local Group of galaxies, and the Local Group moves within the Virgo Cluster, and the Virgo Cluster moves within... "How fast are you moving?" is not an easy question. When Mission Control tells astronauts how fast they're going, there's always an assumed standard of rest. At the start of the voyage, speeds are given relative to the launchpad. But later, when the launchpad is just one more arbritrary place down there on Earth's spinning surface, speeds are given relative to the idealized, non-spinning pinpoint center of Earth. On their way to the Moon, Apollo astronauts had a hard time answering the question, "How fast are you moving?" Speed away from Earth was one thing, and speed toward the Moon was quite another. That's because the Earth and the Moon move relative to one another. Ah, of course! Speed is a relative quantity. When Captain Kirk ask Lieutenant Sulu if the Starship Enterprise has reached a speed of warp 7, Sulu should reply,  "Relative to what, Captain?" Such a sassy reply may get subordinate Starfleet officers in trouble, but it is the only good answer to the question, "How fast are you moving?" This is basic relatively talking. Not fancy Einsteinian relativity, but good old fashioned (and still correct) Galilean relativity. Galileo seems to have been the first person to realize that there is no such thing as an absolute speed. Speeds are relative. This means that speeds only have meaning when they are referred to a reference frame. Presumably that reference frame is itself at rest. But then we have to ask again, "At rest relative to what?" Because even the concept of rest has lost any hint of absolute meaning. Speed is relative, and rest is relative. Earth's speed is 19 miles/second relative to the Sun. The Enterprise's speed is warp 7 relative to the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Your speed is zero relative to your easy chair. But depending on where you sit, it is hundreds of miles/hour relative to Earth's center. When we furrow a brow and ask, "But how fast is Earth really moving?" we imagine Spaceship Earth plowing through the ocean of space as it orbits the Sun. But space is not an ocean. It has no substance as water does. Space is not a thing; space is nothing. Space is no thing. You can move between two points in space, say between Earth and Mars, but you can't move through space. There's nothing to move through. It's like trying to say how much a hole weighs. A hole weighs exactly nothing because a hole is nothing. It's a void, and so is space. To move relative to nothing is meaningless. The concepts of speed and of rest have only relative meaning. They are absolutely meaningless. They mean something only with respect to arbitrarily chosen, artificial frames of reference. If, someday, you are buckled into your spaceship, and you see from the side window, say, a space station whizz by at constant speed, there is no way to know which of you is really moving. Neither of you is really moving because there is no deep reality about constant speed. Constant speed in a straight line has only relative meaning, a kind of relative reality. Does this mean that all motion is relative? No! Some motions have only relative meaning, but some motions have absolute meaning, are absolutely real. For example, constant speed is relative, but change in speed is absolute. Calling something absolute in science means that arbitrary standards are not used in its measurement. It is unambiguously measurable. When your spaceship fires its engines, your change in speed is beyond doubt. You feel it in your stomach, and your ship's sensors can measure it. Outside your window, the passing space station may seem to be changing speed, but the beings inside the station will not feel it. And no sensors can measure it. You are really changing speed, and they are really are not. There's something absolutely real about changes in speed. The same goes for rotation. If your spaceship is spinning, you can feel it, and your ship's sensors can measure it. The space station outside may seem to be going around you, but it is you who feels queasy, not the folks in the space station. You are really spinning, and they really are not. There's something absolutely real about rotation. So, some motions are relative, and some are not. There is no deep reality about constant speed, but changes in speed are deeply real, and so are rotations. We have to be thoughtful in our analysis of everyday experience in order to identify what is deeply real. Since we can be fooled by perceptions as basic as speed, maybe every perception deserves careful scrutiny. This is what inspired Einstein to his incredible insights about the speed of light and forward time travel. Knowing how to identify what is deeply real is tough and important work. If a police officer ever pulls you over for speeding and asks, &quot;Do you know how fast you were going?&quot; an insightful, though perhaps unwise, reply would be, "Relative to what?" And then, as you sit in the backseat of the police car and feel it accelerate toward jail, you can add, &quot;But some things are absolute!&quot;

series and it’s also used for dating meteorites. And, it’s a very small sample. It weighs
a few milligrams but it’s a very, very nice sample, stirred under an inert atmosphere

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the electronic configuration of lutetium, while the generated MCQs are asking about various other aspects of lutetium.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the fact that it at least mentions lutetium and its properties, I would choose:

Question 1: What series of lanthanides does lutetium belong to? 

This question is the most similar because it mentions lutetium and its classification as a lanthanide, which is related to its electronic configuration. However, the question intent and options are still quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the origin of hafnium's name, while the generated MCQs are about hafnium's properties, uses, and potential.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of hafnium, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I really had to choose one, I would say Question 6 is the most similar, but only because it is the least dissimilar. Question 6 asks about the speaker's opinion on the current uses of hafnium, which is still quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

Index: 6 (Note: This is a very weak match and should be taken as an indication that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.)

**Transcript**:
Just a minute ago, this oil helped make a delicious meal possible. But now, it's just some nasty goop. What should we do with it? Well, the easiest thing would be to pour it down the drain; that makes it seem like it's gone, but it's not really gone. Instead, it's collecting bits of food and other random stuff, producing monstrous, greasy blockages that clog not only your own drain but entire sewage systems, causing flooding and pollution. Many places have laws for proper disposal of grease, but we can go one step further. Instead of just throwing it away safely, we can turn it into something useful. And if you're wondering what anyone could possibly want with a bunch of digusting, used cooking oil, the answer is: biodiesel. You've probably heard of diesel engines. They power farming and construction equipment, trucks, buses, ships, trains, backup generators, and even some cars. Most of the fuel that feeds these engines is refined from petroleum, which comes from long-dead dinosaurs and other ancient fossils. But diesel fuel can also be derived from more recently-dead organisms, like plants and animals. And this type of fuel is what we call biodiesel. Biodiesel is a biodegradable energy source, made from plant oils or animal fats, that can usually be burned in regular diesel engines. You guessed it, it's the 'bio' version of diesel. It's cleaner than normal diesel, so there has been a push to generate it from crops like soybeans. Now, growing plants for fuel, instead of food, comes with its own problems. But fortunately, we already have some oils and fats right here. Preparing your used cooking grease for recycling is easy. First, let it cool down to room temperature. Then, transfer it to a clean container. You can use any old bottles you have lying around, like milk jugs, as long as they're completely empty, rinsed, and dried. Use a funnel to avoid spills and a sieve to filter out any small food particles. You can even add bacon grease and other animal fats or the excess oil from canned food, like tuna or sardines, just make sure it's really oil and not brine. So, what happens now that your oil is safely contained? Well, many cities have recycling services that will pick up large amounts of grease from restaurants and other establishments. But there are locations where individuals can drop off their containers, as well. All of this grease will end up at a processing plant, where it can be converted to useable biodiesel. How does this conversion work? Well, all these oils and fats you donated are made up of triglycerides, a glycerol molecule connected to three fatty acid chains. To convert fats to fuel, they react with an alcohol, usually methanol or ethanol, which produces long-chain esters and glycerol. To compare, here are some molecules of regular diesel fuel. Now, here are the molecules we created by breaking apart the triglycerides. Glycerol is the odd man out, so it's removed at the end of the process. But look at these esters! If you squint, their structures look pretty similar to those of the long-chain hydrocarbons in regular diesel. And diesel engines, with a few small modifications, can also be made to squint and burn these esters like regular diesel fuel. Et voila! Biodiesel. Now, you might be wondering whether all this hassle over recycling used cooking oil is even worth it. After all, how much energy can it possibly generate? Well, if all the grease that New Yorkers throw away in one day were converted to jet fuel, it would be enough to power several hundred flights from New York to Los Angeles. And let's not forget that using waste oil instead of burning more fossil fuels will limit our negative effects on the environment. Recycling used cooking grease turns goop into good. By contributing a little bit, individuals and businesses can help create an alternative, stable source of diesel oil, while protecting the environment and keeping our cities cleaner. And that's pretty slick.

**Transcript**:
Just a minute ago, this oil helped make a delicious meal possible. But now, it's just some nasty goop. What should we do with it? Well, the easiest thing would be to pour it down the drain; that makes it seem like it's gone, but it's not really gone. Instead, it's collecting bits of food and other random stuff, producing monstrous, greasy blockages that clog not only your own drain but entire sewage systems, causing flooding and pollution. Many places have laws for proper disposal of grease, but we can go one step further. Instead of just throwing it away safely, we can turn it into something useful. And if you're wondering what anyone could possibly want with a bunch of digusting, used cooking oil, the answer is: biodiesel. You've probably heard of diesel engines. They power farming and construction equipment, trucks, buses, ships, trains, backup generators, and even some cars. Most of the fuel that feeds these engines is refined from petroleum, which comes from long-dead dinosaurs and other ancient fossils. But diesel fuel can also be derived from more recently-dead organisms, like plants and animals. And this type of fuel is what we call biodiesel. Biodiesel is a biodegradable energy source, made from plant oils or animal fats, that can usually be burned in regular diesel engines. You guessed it, it's the 'bio' version of diesel. It's cleaner than normal diesel, so there has been a push to generate it from crops like soybeans. Now, growing plants for fuel, instead of food, comes with its own problems. But fortunately, we already have some oils and fats right here. Preparing your used cooking grease for recycling is easy. First, let it cool down to room temperature. Then, transfer it to a clean container. You can use any old bottles you have lying around, like milk jugs, as long as they're completely empty, rinsed, and dried. Use a funnel to avoid spills and a sieve to filter out any small food particles. You can even add bacon grease and other animal fats or the excess oil from canned food, like tuna or sardines, just make sure it's really oil and not brine. So, what happens now that your oil is safely contained? Well, many cities have recycling services that will pick up large amounts of grease from restaurants and other establishments. But there are locations where individuals can drop off their containers, as well. All of this grease will end up at a processing plant, where it can be converted to useable biodiesel. How does this conversion work? Well, all these oils and fats you donated are made up of triglycerides, a glycerol molecule connected to three fatty acid chains. To convert fats to fuel, they react with an alcohol, usually methanol or ethanol, which produces long-chain esters and glycerol. To compare, here are some molecules of regular diesel fuel. Now, here are the molecules we created by breaking apart the triglycerides. Glycerol is the odd man out, so it's removed at the end of the process. But look at these esters! If you squint, their structures look pretty similar to those of the long-chain hydrocarbons in regular diesel. And diesel engines, with a few small modifications, can also be made to squint and burn these esters like regular diesel fuel. Et voila! Biodiesel. Now, you might be wondering whether all this hassle over recycling used cooking oil is even worth it. After all, how much energy can it possibly generate? Well, if all the grease that New Yorkers throw away in one day were converted to jet fuel, it would be enough to power several hundred flights from New York to Los Angeles. And let's not forget that using waste oil instead of burning more fossil fuels will limit our negative effects on the environment. Recycling used cooking grease turns goop into good. By contributing a little bit, individuals and businesses can help create an alternative, stable source of diesel oil, while protecting the environment and keeping our cities cleaner. And that's pretty slick.

This is Ytterbium. Again, a Lanthanide. Stored in a very old  glass bowl. Ytterbium is one of three Lanthanides, which was named after a Swedish town called Ytterby which is where They were all discovered. Ytterbium, Terbium and Erbium  were all derivatives of that town name. The town's done well out of it, hasn't it? -The town's did very well out of it, yeah.  Have you ever been there?  No, not personally. -You should go! Yeah, I should.  It's quite moving, and quite... Quite stirring to be here  in this place because this is  where science and industry  came together, for one of the earliest times I suppose. And quite a significant place  of discovery and economic vibrancy  for the local area.  It's almost spiritual, It's really quite,  quite different. What does it look like? Ytterbium, it depends on  whether talk about metal  or as an element. Often,  Ytterbium 2 compounds as sort of yellows  and oranges. Where did I get it from? From a catalogue. So Ytterbium, it's a rare  earth element, it's a metal. It's a silvery lustrous metal. It's very soft and it reacts very readily  with oxygen to form  a very nice protective oxide layer which sits over the metal. So it preserves itself after a reaction  with oxygen.  It was first identified  or first isolated from a sample  of a mineral which was recovered  from this very quarry, where were in Ytterby near Stockholm in Sweden. But it took a very long time  to make that extraction  and to purify the metal. It's a rare Earth element, It's one of 15. And it's actually the least abandoned of the rare Earths.  But the name "rare earth" makes you think that it's really rare. But if you look at its occurrence  in the Earth's crust, it was a surprise to find  that actually it's twice as abundant as tin. But that said, total production  of Ytterbium is only 50 tons per year. So it's still very little utilized, and that's probably  because its chemistry  is least understood.  And it's least understood  because we really aren't able  to isolate significant meant  of Ytterbium  in the late 1950s. Like many other rare earth elements, it's main applications lie in electronics industry. It's used as a dopant for phosphorus, it's used as a dopant for ceramic capacitors,  and other electronic devices. So really niche applications,  but research is broadening  these applications day on day. The metal itself is really quite unusual  because its properties change as a function of pressure. So it's a metal, so it's a conductor.  But when you push it  under extreme pressure,  say 14,000 atmospheres of pressure, it becomes a semiconductor. And that semi conductor ability  changes as a function of temperature so it's used as a pressure sensor  in extreme environments.  And in fact, one of the major applications as an electronic devices  for the monitoring  sort of measurement of pressure especially within nuclear explosions. So quite a significant element, and quite a recent discovery.  . . . . . . . . . . . .

**Transcript**:
So this is a sample of osmium. Osmium, again,
is a precious metal, platinum-group metal, and this is an
osmium sponge which is very nicely packaged up in this box.
So let’s have a look and see if we can find it. So osmium is another one of the elements in
the so-called ‘platinum group’ and it is quite unusual
in that its oxide – osmium tetroxide is a stable compound which
is really quite easily evaporated. It has quite a strong smell
which is unusual for metal compounds and it can be evaporated
quite easily and it is used in organic chemistry because
if you have compounds with double bonds between two carbon
atoms, osmium tetroxide reacts with it really quite
easily. So here the osmium itself, it is a very, very
reactive metal, it is sealed in this glass ampule under an inert
atmosphere of argon so that it can’t oxidise. The argon
is very inert and it stops the metal reacting. So here you can
see this very dark black metal, very fine spongy-type material,
at the bottom of this glass vial. Again, osmium has played some role in my life
because I did some of the early work in my doctorate involved
osmium compound, it was ruthenium and osmium and
iron. The ruthenium compound was orange, the osmium
compound a rather fetching pale yellow and the iron compound
a very dark green. And the osmium compound was perhaps
the most boring because it behaved in exactly the way
that was predicted. So osmium reacts with the air to form osmium
tetroxide, which is a very, very toxic material, it makes
us go blind so we have very careful with storing the osmium. Since then, I think in my life I have made
one osmium compound that nobody had ever made before,
it wasn’t enough to see but I could see the absorption
of light by this compound, so I was really quite excited. Do you remember what it was it in it? What? Do you remember what it was, the compound? The compound was osmium dicarbonyl dinitrosyl
and it was interesting because nobody had ever made this
compound before, but it was similar to a compound of
iron which was quite well known. The compound of iron looked
like blood; it was a really quite dramatic compound. I never
found out what the colour of the osmium compound was,
I never made enough, but I am not a very good synthetic
chemist.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What is the name of the compound that the speaker mentions as being similar to a compound of iron, but with a different colour? Options: A. Osmium dicarbonyl dinitrosyl, B. Osmium tetroxide, C. Osmium compound with iron, D. Ruthenium compound.

However, a more similar match is Question 9: What is the significance of osmium dicarbonyl dinitrosyl in the context of the speaker's work? Options: A. It is a compound that the speaker made for the first time, B. It is a compound that the speaker was unable to make, C. It is a compound that the speaker made in order to study its properties, D. It is a compound that the speaker was not interested in.

But since Question 9 does not ask for the name of the compound, but rather its significance, and its options do not include other compounds, the closest match would be Question 5.

However, if we consider the intent of the question, the closest match is indeed Question 9.

Therefore, I will provide the index of Question 9 as the most similar generated MCQ.

So actinium: it’s often said about radioactivity
that you might be glowing in the dark if you work with radioactive elements.
By-and-large it’s not true. However, actinium is one of them which
might do that because the element itself glows blue in the dark. And actinium is actually more dangerous than
plutonium, and plutonium was once described as the most deadly and
toxic substance known to Man. So it’s pretty dangerous. I’ll avoid it! Have you had anything to
do with it at all? No, because it’s so dangerous. When I was an undergraduate I saw this book
here, which was written by Seaborg, and I really liked the cover because
I think it looked really nice and I was also quite interested about
the transuranium elements because I didn’t really know much about
them. And he, probably more than anybody else, discovered more of these
elements than any other scientist, probably more elements than most
if not all scientists. And he wrote in this book about the chemistry of
the different elements and, although we consider that these are pretty
radioactive and so on, they at least managed to isolate enough material so
you could see it in the bottom of a small glass tube. It may not have
been bigger than the tip of a pin or something like that, but it’s a
huge amount compared to the one or two atoms that were formed of some of these
elements very near the end of the periodic table.

I'm changing my tie to an alkali metal tie.  You have an alkali metal tie? It's a new tie I just got. This one's a Dutch one. I was given it on Saturday  So here you can see we have the alkali metals (And where are they?) Here. And the alkali metals are very reactive.  So, we've seen that lithium doesn't react very much  but then as you go to sodium  and then to potassium  and rubidium  the violence of the reaction gets more and more and more. In cesium it's even greater.  I don't know wether the people making this tie were so frightened that they didn't put it on. But in each of these cases the reaction is removing one electron after another, one electron from the outer shell of the atom, and the bigger the atom, the easier it is to remove the electron. And as you go down the periodic table,  the size of the atom increases so it's easier to remove the electron. So francium would almost certainly be even bigger than cesium, because it's a whole row lower down.  And so, that should react with water with enormous violence. But, unfortunately, francium is very radioactive  and you can't get a nice lump of francium the sort of size that you'd like to throw in water to make the YouTube video of the century.  Francium was named after France, was discovered by one of Madame Curie's pupils in 1939, five years after Madame Curie herself died. I always thought it was Madame Curie herself that discovered it but in fact it was discovered after her death.  But its properties would probably be  similar to those of cesium if it was not very radioactive.  But radioactivity like that makes it very difficult for chemists to study the chemistry in enormous detail.  Chemical reactions are really quite sensitive to temperature and radioactive materials, as they decay, give out energy so the compounds themselves tend to heat up.  A lump of Plutonium, which is very radioactive, is really quite warm to touch. And francium, which I think is more radioactive, is probably very warm. So I think the melting point of francium will be lower than that of cesium because the melting points go down the group,  and because it will be generating heat,  almost certainly francium will be liquid at room temperature. But I've never seen it.   It might well be colored, as well, because cesium is golden colored so I would not be surprised if francium was red.  But I have no idea. And I'm not sure if anybody knows. . . . . . . . . . . . .

So, we've seen that lithium doesn't react very much  but then as you go to sodium  and then to potassium  and rubidium  the violence of the reaction gets more and more and more. In cesium it's even greater.  I don't know wether the people making this tie were so frightened that they didn't put it on. But in each of these cases the reaction is removing one electron after another, one electron from the outer shell of the atom, and the bigger the atom, the easier it is to remove the electron. And as you go down the periodic table,  the size of the atom increases so it's easier to remove the electron. So francium would almost certainly be even bigger than cesium, because it's a whole row lower down.  And so, that should react with water with enormous violence. But, unfortunately, francium is very radioactive  and you can't get a nice lump of francium the sort of size that you'd like to throw in water to make the YouTube video of the century.  Francium was named after France, was discovered by one of Madame Curie's pupils in 1939, five years after Madame Curie herself died. I always thought it was Madame Curie herself that discovered it but in fact it was discovered after her death.  But its properties would probably be  similar to those of cesium if it was not very radioactive.  But radioactivity like that makes it very difficult for chemists to study the chemistry in enormous detail.  Chemical reactions are really quite sensitive to temperature and radioactive materials, as they decay, give out energy so the compounds themselves tend to heat up.  A lump of Plutonium, which is very radioactive, is really quite warm to touch. And francium, which I think is more radioactive, is probably very warm. So I think the melting point of francium will be lower than that of cesium because the melting points go down the group,  and because it will be generating heat,  almost certainly francium will be liquid at room temperature. But I've never seen it.   It might well be colored, as well, because cesium is golden colored so I would not be surprised if francium was red.  But I have no idea. And I'm not sure if anybody knows. . . . . . . . . . . . .

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the amount of francium present in the Earth's crust, which is not directly related to any of the generated MCQs. However, Question 10 is about the difficulty of obtaining a lump of francium, which is related to the fact that francium is very radioactive and has a short half-life.

Based on this analysis, I would suggest that Question 10 is the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
I just think it's so wonderful. We always think of these scientists in the past as being saints. And here he is sitting in his office thinking "Hee hee I've made my competitor feel uncomfortable" And in a way it's sad that we lose these bits of information because it makes science seem so much more exciting. We're in the library of the Royal Society Looking at letters about Radon. Radon is the heaviest of the noble gases and in the early nineteen hundreds there was still a big argument about the work and trying to isolate Radon. Radon is given off as a gas in the radioactive decay of Radium. Radium decays radioactively emitting an alpha particle - that's a nucleus of Helium with the mass 4 - and generates Radon. Radon is itself radioactive and decays so you have to have it, as it were, freshly made. Rather like you can only get fresh meat. If you keep it for a long time it decays away. The half life of the most stable isotope of Radon is just over three days so it's really relatively short lived. That means if you have a certain amount of gas, after three days you'll only have half of it. Another three days a quarter of it. And by the time you come back from your holidays most of it's gone. In the days that this letter was written, the way they were getting it was from the decay of Radium. In fact I've read - and this is quite exciting. It's the first time you've ever seen a glass in the library because they're strictly forbidden. - The way they did it was to take a glass vessel and fill it with water. Imagine now you have a container of water with a piece of Radium metal at the bottom. It is breaking down, generating Radon gas and bubbles of this gas will go up to the top. very small amounts of gas, bacause Radium doesn't decay very fast. And so, we can imagine that Rutherford and Ramsay are really competing to get the first sample to characterize it. And because it also contains alpha particles, it will be contaminated with Helium. You've got to realize that these famous scientists were extraordinarily competitive. They wanted to get there first. And they considered the other one, really a bit of a scoundrel. And so there was a sort of competition which is difficult for us now to imagine. And in fact Rutherford was really rude about Ramsay's work. He says, his work - that's Ramsay's work - is all right superficially, on the surface, but when you get down in it you begin to see the nothingness of it all. So he thinks it's rubbish. So this is in a private letter to his friend Schuster - Schuster was his surname -and he begins, "My dear Schuster", because in those days you called your friends by their surnames. No first names; It wasn't right. And this was written on July 30th 1908, so more than a hundred years ago. The reason he's written this letter, is because he's real excited he has got a spectrum of this Radon gas. It wasn't called Radon then; It was called Radium Emanation - Emanation means "coming out of Radium." And he's got a spectrum, and Ramsay hasn't. It was really quite exciting. And so he sent a photograph. And, this is the photograph. So, Rutherford has signed this and he said, "Some of the lines run together in the reproduction" - that's the print - " and ??? they're quite clear in the negative" So, he had an experiment in which he had a small amount of this gas, not more than 0.2 of a cubic centimeter, so it's not very much, in which presumably, though he doesn't say so, he put an electric discharge through it so that the gas glowed. Rather like a Neon sign glows red in a shopping center. And he then photographed this light coming out with a photographic film, using a spectroscope to spread out the different colours. All these gases give a whole series of lines and this is a print of his photograph, because you get a negative in the pho... originally and then he's printed it. If you come close you can see it says the "SPECTRUM OF RADIUM EMANATION" There are actually three spectra here. At the top and the bottom are the spectra of Helium gas as a calibration so that he can see what the wavelengths are. And he's written, all the way down here, the wavelengths of the Helium lines. You can see Rutherford has fantastically good small handwriting, or it might have been his assistant, Kay, who wrote this, because his handwriting looks pretty difficult to read. And then, in the middle, is the spectrum of Radon - Radium Emanation It shows that Radon is a completely separate element. And he's really excited because this is the first spectrum that he believes in. Ramsay claims to have got a spectrum, but Rutherford doesn't believe him. I don't know, because it doesn't say here, whether Rutherford ever published this spectrum apart from just sending it to his friend, but it sounds as if he's going to publish it, because he wrote, "I think Royds" - that's his colleague - "and I, have certainly succeeded in making Ramsay temporally very unhappy." We always think of these scientists in the past as being saints. And here he is sitting in his office thinking, "Hee hee I've made my competitor feel uncomfortable." Do you ever feel like that when you get one up on your scientific colleagues/collaborators/rivals? You say it's a wonderful thing and a human thing. Let me put you on the spot. Do you ever take delight in beating people to things? I don't usually get quite so aggressive, perhaps it's not my nature, though I did get quite excited when I made a compound that my German friend, Friedrich, couldn't and I felt really quite good about that, but in a friendly sort of way. I was not hoping that he would be sitting there, um, crying or whatever, but there are stories of Nobel prize winners tearing up journals or jumping up and down on the journals when their rival has published something else. And I think it's important to realize that it's good to feel emotional about these things because then you may have better ideas. If you're sitting there, cold and calculating and not very involved, perhaps you won't have the brilliant breakthrough that you might do otherwise. I don't know what happened. I suspect that Rutherford became more interested in the structure of the atom and, having got this and so on, lost his enthusiasm or got more excited about something else, because in the end, if you look in the books, it's Ramsay who's credited with discovering Radon, though according to some sources, he didn't want to call it Radon and he thought of a nice name, he wanted to call it Niton for some rather obscure Latin derivation. But I think Radon is a nice name. It sounds a bit like Argon or Xenon and also, it connects it very nicely with Radium. So, as names go, it's really quite a good and understandable name. As far as I know nobody has really studied the chemistry of Radon in much detail but, because it's below Xenon in the periodic table there will be quite an extensive chemistry. You will be able to make Fluorine compunds, probably oxides and a variety of other ones. And generally, as you go down the periodic table the chemistry of the noble gases gets richer and richer. A couple of years ago, Brady and I went to an institute in Germany, in Darmstadt, and they had a display for the public of a cloud chamber. Ok we have a cloud chamber here and I will now inject radioactive Radon gas into the chamber and you will see that there is a lot of radioactive decay going on when I inject it. So now we have to wait a second for the gas inside And Brady and I sat there for some time, watching these trails, which look really very beautiful.

This question is related to the concept of half-life, which is also the focus of the ground truth MCQ. Although the question wording and options are not identical, the intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the amount of radon-222 remaining after 6 days, which requires an understanding of the half-life concept.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What is the name of the scientist who claimed to have obtained a spectrum of Radon gas, but Rutherford did not believe? 

However, the options provided for this question do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be Question 1, if the options were changed to focus on who recorded the "Spectrum of Radon Emanation". 

But based on the provided options, the closest match is Question 5's opposite, which would be the person who recorded the spectrum that they believed in. In this case, Question 1 is the closest match.

However, another generated MCQ, Question 5, when modified to "What is the name of the scientist who recorded the Spectrum of Radon Emanation?" would be an exact match.

Since this is not an option, the closest match is Question 1: What is the name of the scientist who wrote the letter to his friend Schuster on July 30th, 1908? 

This question is about the same person and the details provided in the question are related to the context of the ground truth MCQ.

The correct index is: 1

**Transcript**:
I just think it's so wonderful. We always think of these scientists in the past as being saints. And here he is sitting in his office thinking "Hee hee I've made my competitor feel uncomfortable" And in a way it's sad that we lose these bits of information because it makes science seem so much more exciting. We're in the library of the Royal Society Looking at letters about Radon. Radon is the heaviest of the noble gases and in the early nineteen hundreds there was still a big argument about the work and trying to isolate Radon. Radon is given off as a gas in the radioactive decay of Radium. Radium decays radioactively emitting an alpha particle - that's a nucleus of Helium with the mass 4 - and generates Radon. Radon is itself radioactive and decays so you have to have it, as it were, freshly made. Rather like you can only get fresh meat. If you keep it for a long time it decays away. The half life of the most stable isotope of Radon is just over three days so it's really relatively short lived. That means if you have a certain amount of gas, after three days you'll only have half of it. Another three days a quarter of it. And by the time you come back from your holidays most of it's gone. In the days that this letter was written, the way they were getting it was from the decay of Radium. In fact I've read - and this is quite exciting. It's the first time you've ever seen a glass in the library because they're strictly forbidden. - The way they did it was to take a glass vessel and fill it with water. Imagine now you have a container of water with a piece of Radium metal at the bottom. It is breaking down, generating Radon gas and bubbles of this gas will go up to the top. very small amounts of gas, bacause Radium doesn't decay very fast. And so, we can imagine that Rutherford and Ramsay are really competing to get the first sample to characterize it. And because it also contains alpha particles, it will be contaminated with Helium. You've got to realize that these famous scientists were extraordinarily competitive. They wanted to get there first. And they considered the other one, really a bit of a scoundrel. And so there was a sort of competition which is difficult for us now to imagine. And in fact Rutherford was really rude about Ramsay's work. He says, his work - that's Ramsay's work - is all right superficially, on the surface, but when you get down in it you begin to see the nothingness of it all. So he thinks it's rubbish. So this is in a private letter to his friend Schuster - Schuster was his surname -and he begins, "My dear Schuster", because in those days you called your friends by their surnames. No first names; It wasn't right. And this was written on July 30th 1908, so more than a hundred years ago. The reason he's written this letter, is because he's real excited he has got a spectrum of this Radon gas. It wasn't called Radon then; It was called Radium Emanation - Emanation means "coming out of Radium." And he's got a spectrum, and Ramsay hasn't. It was really quite exciting. And so he sent a photograph. And, this is the photograph. So, Rutherford has signed this and he said, "Some of the lines run together in the reproduction" - that's the print - " and ??? they're quite clear in the negative" So, he had an experiment in which he had a small amount of this gas, not more than 0.2 of a cubic centimeter, so it's not very much, in which presumably, though he doesn't say so, he put an electric discharge through it so that the gas glowed. Rather like a Neon sign glows red in a shopping center. And he then photographed this light coming out with a photographic film, using a spectroscope to spread out the different colours. All these gases give a whole series of lines and this is a print of his photograph, because you get a negative in the pho... originally and then he's printed it. If you come close you can see it says the "SPECTRUM OF RADIUM EMANATION" There are actually three spectra here. At the top and the bottom are the spectra of Helium gas as a calibration so that he can see what the wavelengths are. And he's written, all the way down here, the wavelengths of the Helium lines. You can see Rutherford has fantastically good small handwriting, or it might have been his assistant, Kay, who wrote this, because his handwriting looks pretty difficult to read. And then, in the middle, is the spectrum of Radon - Radium Emanation It shows that Radon is a completely separate element. And he's really excited because this is the first spectrum that he believes in. Ramsay claims to have got a spectrum, but Rutherford doesn't believe him. I don't know, because it doesn't say here, whether Rutherford ever published this spectrum apart from just sending it to his friend, but it sounds as if he's going to publish it, because he wrote, "I think Royds" - that's his colleague - "and I, have certainly succeeded in making Ramsay temporally very unhappy." We always think of these scientists in the past as being saints. And here he is sitting in his office thinking, "Hee hee I've made my competitor feel uncomfortable." Do you ever feel like that when you get one up on your scientific colleagues/collaborators/rivals? You say it's a wonderful thing and a human thing. Let me put you on the spot. Do you ever take delight in beating people to things? I don't usually get quite so aggressive, perhaps it's not my nature, though I did get quite excited when I made a compound that my German friend, Friedrich, couldn't and I felt really quite good about that, but in a friendly sort of way. I was not hoping that he would be sitting there, um, crying or whatever, but there are stories of Nobel prize winners tearing up journals or jumping up and down on the journals when their rival has published something else. And I think it's important to realize that it's good to feel emotional about these things because then you may have better ideas. If you're sitting there, cold and calculating and not very involved, perhaps you won't have the brilliant breakthrough that you might do otherwise. I don't know what happened. I suspect that Rutherford became more interested in the structure of the atom and, having got this and so on, lost his enthusiasm or got more excited about something else, because in the end, if you look in the books, it's Ramsay who's credited with discovering Radon, though according to some sources, he didn't want to call it Radon and he thought of a nice name, he wanted to call it Niton for some rather obscure Latin derivation. But I think Radon is a nice name. It sounds a bit like Argon or Xenon and also, it connects it very nicely with Radium. So, as names go, it's really quite a good and understandable name. As far as I know nobody has really studied the chemistry of Radon in much detail but, because it's below Xenon in the periodic table there will be quite an extensive chemistry. You will be able to make Fluorine compunds, probably oxides and a variety of other ones. And generally, as you go down the periodic table the chemistry of the noble gases gets richer and richer. A couple of years ago, Brady and I went to an institute in Germany, in Darmstadt, and they had a display for the public of a cloud chamber. Ok we have a cloud chamber here and I will now inject radioactive Radon gas into the chamber and you will see that there is a lot of radioactive decay going on when I inject it. So now we have to wait a second for the gas inside And Brady and I sat there for some time, watching these trails, which look really very beautiful.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so since I was here last no.6 we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue so we covered that fairly extensively in skeptic magazine we investigate all kinds of scientific and quasi scientific controversies but it turns out we don't really have to worry about any of this because the world's gonna end in 2012 another update you will call so I introduced you guys to the Quadro tracker it's a like a water dowsing device it's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around and you walk around and it points to things like if you're looking for marijuana and students lockers it'll you know like point right to some somebody I'm sorry this particular one that was given to me finds golf balls especially if you're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes well under the category of what's the harm of silly stuff like this this device the a de 651 was sold to the Iraqi government for $40,000 apiece it's just like this one completely worthless in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction which translates to pseudo scientific baloney would be the nice word which you string together a bunch of words that sound good but it does absolutely nothing in this case allowing at trespass points allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay actually cost lives so there is a danger to pseudoscience and believing in this sort of thing so what I want to talk about today is belief I want to believe and and you do too and in fact I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things it is the default option we just believe we believe all sorts of things belief is natural disbelief skepticism science is not natural it's it's more difficult it's uncomfortable to not believe things so like Fox Mulder on x-files who wants to believe in UFOs what we all do and the reason for that is because we are we have a belief engine in our brains essentially we are pattern-seeking primates we connect the dots a is connected to B B is connected to C and sometimes they really is connected to B and that's called association learning we find patterns we make those connections whether it's Pavlov's dog here associating the sound of the Bell with the food and then he celebrates to the sound of the Bell or whether it's thus Canarian rat in which he's having an association between his behavior and a reward for it and therefore he repeats the behavior in fact what Skinner discovered is that if you put a pigeon in a box like this and he has to press one of these two keys and he tries to figure out what the pattern is and you give them a little reward in the hopper box there if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern they will figure out any kind of pattern and whatever they were doing just before they got the reward they repeat that particular pattern sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise once clockwise and peck the key twice and that's called superstition and that I'm afraid we will always have with us I called this process pattern issah T that is the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise when we do this process we make two types of errors a type 1 error or false positive is believing a pattern is real when it's not our second type of error is a false negative a type 2 error is not believed in a pattern is real when it is so let's do a thought experiment you are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of Africa your name is Lucy okay and and you hear a rustle in the grass is it a dangerous predator is it just the wind your next decision could be the most important one of your life well if you think that the rustle in the grass is is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind you've made an error in cognition you made a type 1 error false positive but no harm you just move away you're more cautious you're more vigilant on the other hand if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind and it turns out it's a dangerous predator your lunch you've just won a Darwin Award you've been taken out of the gene pool now the problem here is that pattern is cities will occur whenever the of making a type 1 error is less than the cost of making a type 2 error is the only equation in the talk by the way we have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a type 1 and a type 2 error is highly problematic especially in split-second life-and-death situations so the default position is just believe all patterns are real all rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind and so I think that we evolved there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines are pattern-seeking brain processes to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to so for example what do you see here it's a horse head that's right it looks like a horse must be a horse that's a pattern and is it really a horse or is it more like a frog see our pattern detection device which is appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex it's our little sort of detection device there can be easily fooled and this is the problem for example what do you see here yes of course it's a cow once I primed the brains called cognitive priming once I prime the brain to see it it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it and what do you see here some people see a Dalmatian dog yes there it is and there's the prime so when I go back without the prime your brain already has the model so you can see it again what do you see here planet Saturn yes that's good how about here just shout out anything you see that's a good audience Chris because there's nothing in this well allegedly there's nothing this is an experiment done by Jennifer whitson at at UT Austin on corporate environments and whether uncertain feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns that is almost everybody sees the planet Saturn people that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this which is allegedly patternless in other words the propensity to feel these are fine these patterns goes up when there's a lack of control for example baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they're batting but not so much when they're fielding because fielder's are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time the best batters fail seven out of ten times so their superstitions their pattern issah tees are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth what do you see on this particular one here in this field anybody see a object there there actually is something here but it's degraded while you're thinking about that this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore a psychologist in England who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an ESP test how much do they believe in the paranormal supernatural angels and and so forth and those who scored high on the ESP scale tended to see I only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns here is what you show subjects the fish is degraded 20% 50% and then the one I showed you 70 percent a similar experiment was done by another British psychologist named Peter Berger who found significantly more patterns meaningful patterns are received perceived on the right hemisphere via the left visual field in the left hemisphere so if you present subjects the image is such that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left then they're more likely to see patterns than if you've put it on the left hemisphere our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this pattern issah T occurs so what we're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens Berger and his colleague Christine Moore gave subjects Aldo l-dopa is a drug as you know given for treating parkinson's disease which is related to a decrease in dopamine l-dopa increases dopamine an increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine so dopamine appears to be the drug associated with pattern isset II in fact neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior things like paranoia delusions and hallucinations these are pattern isset 'is there incorrect patterns or false positives or type 1 errors and if you give them drugs that are a'dope Amin antagonists they go away that is you decrease the amount of dopamine and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases on the other hand and feta means like in cocaine our dopamine agonist they increase the amount of dopamine so you're more likely to be feeling a euphoric state creativity find more patterns in fact I saw Robin Williams recently talked about how he he was thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine when he had that issue than that now so perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity dopamine I think changes our signal-to-noise ratio that is how accurate we are in finding patterns if it's too low you're more likely to make too many type 2 errors you missed the real patterns you don't want to be too skeptical if you're too skeptical you miss the really interesting good ideas just right you're creative and yet you don't fall for too much baloney too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere every time somebody looks at you you think people are staring at you you think people are talking about you and if you go too far on that that's just simply labelled as madness it's a distinction perhaps we might make between two Nobel laureates Richard Fineman and John Nash one sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a Nobel Prize the other one also but maybe too many patterns and we then call that schizophrenia so the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern detection problem and of course you all know exactly what this is right and what pattern do you see here again I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here causing you conflicting pattern detection you know of course this is via uno shoes these are sandals pretty sexy feet I must say maybe a little photoshopped and of course the ambiguous figures that seem to flip-flop back and forth turns out what you're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see and I'm and you see the lamp here I know because it lights on here of course thanks to the environmentalist movement we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals so what you see in this in this particular ambiguous figures of course the Dolphins right you see a dolphin here and and there's a dolphin and there's a dolphin this is adult that's a dolphin tail there guys [Applause] if if we can give you conflicting data again your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive if you look down here it's fine if you look up here then you get conflicting data and then we have to flip the image for you to see that it's a setup impossible cradle lusion it's easy to fool the brain and 2d so you say well come on trimmer anybody can do that in a psych 101 text with a illusion like that well here's the late great Jerry Andrus is impossible create illusion in 3d in which Jerry is standing inside the impossible crate and he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal of course camera angle is everything the photographer is over there and this board appears to overlap with this one and this one at that one and so on but even when I take it away the illusion is so powerful because of how our brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns this is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle in fact it's the exact same picture side-by-side so what you're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one but with that one and so your brain is fooled yet again your pattern detection devices are fooled faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes here are some faces on the side of Iraq I'm actually not even sure if this is this might be Photoshop but anyway the point is still made but which one of these looks odd to you in a quick reaction which one looks odd the one on the left ok I'll rotate it so it'll be the one on the right and you are correct fairly famous illusion was first done with Margaret Thatcher now they trade up to politicians every time well why is this happening well we know exactly where it happens in the temporal lobe right across a sort of above your ear there in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus and there's two types of cells that do this that record facial features either globally or specifically these large rapid-firing cells first look at the general face so you recognize Obama immediately and then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes in the mouth especially when they're upside down you're engaging that general facial recognition software there now I said back in our little thought experiment you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa is it just the wind or a dangerous predator what's the difference between those well a wind is inanimate a dangerous predator is an intentional agent and I call this process agent issah T that is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning and tension and agency often invisible beings from the top down this is an idea that we got from a fellow tedster here Dan Dennett who talked about and taking the intentional stance so it's a type of that expanded to explain I think a lot of different things soul spirits ghosts gods demons angels aliens intelligent designers government conspiracists in all manner of invisible agents with power and intention or believe to haunt our world and control our lives I think it's the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism it's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us more moral than us and the narratives always are that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high the intelligent designer is always portrayed as this super intelligent moral being that comes down to design life even the idea that government can rescue us that's no longer the wave of the future but that is I think a type of agent isset II they're projecting somebody up there big and powerful will come rescue us and this is also I think the basis of conspiracy theories there's somebody hiding behind they're pulling the strings whether it's the Illuminati or the Bilderbergers but this is a pattern detection problem isn't it some patterns are real and some are not was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin well if you go there there's people there on any given day like when I went there here showing me where the different shooters were my favorite one was he was in the manhole and he popped out at the last second took that shot but of course Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy so we can't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that because let's face it some patterns are real some conspiracies really are true explains a lot maybe at 9/11 as a conspiracy theory it is a conspiracy we did a whole issue on it 19 members of al-qaeda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy but that's not what the 9/11 truthers think they think it was an inside job by the Bush administration well that's a whole nother lecture but you know we know that 9/11 was not orchestrated by the Bush administration because it worked so we are natural-born duelists our agent is city process somes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these because we can imagine an essence continuing on we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences near-death experiences which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there or you can do it through loss of consciousness by accelerating in a centrifuge you get a hypoxia or a lower oxygen and the brain then senses that there's a out of body experience you can use which I did went out and did Michael Persinger is God helmet that bombard your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves and you get a sense of out-of-body experience so I'm going to I'm gonna end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together it's just a minute and a half it ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief go ahead and roll it this is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm we're hoping that we can use part of this in a national commercial alright and this is a test on some lip balms that we have over here and these are our models who are going to help us turn mad and we have a leading brand would you have any problem kissing our models today [Music] you think that was fine is a blind test I'm gonna ask you two to go ahead and put a blindfold on okay now can you see anything hold up so you can't even see down it's completely blind now right okay now what I'm going to be looking for in this test is [Music] and maybe if you can discern any flavor have you ever done a kissing tested okay now I'm going to ask you to pucker up pucker up big and lean in just a little bit okay [Music] for how does that feel [Music] [Applause] thank you very much thank you Thanks Thanks

pretty sexy feet I must say maybe a little photoshopped and of course the ambiguous figures that seem to flip-flop back and forth turns out what you're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see and I'm and you see the lamp here I know because it lights on here of course thanks to the environmentalist movement we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals so what you see in this in this particular ambiguous figures of course the Dolphins right you see a dolphin here and and there's a dolphin and there's a dolphin this is adult that's a dolphin tail there guys [Applause] if if we can give you conflicting data again your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive if you look down here it's fine if you look up here then you get conflicting data and then we have to flip the image for you to see that it's a setup impossible cradle lusion it's easy to fool the brain and 2d so you say well come on trimmer anybody can do that in a psych 101 text with a illusion like that well here's the late great Jerry Andrus is impossible create illusion in 3d in which Jerry is standing inside the impossible crate and he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal of course camera angle is everything the photographer is over there and this board appears to overlap with this one and this one at that one and so on but even when I take it away the illusion is so powerful because of how our brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns this is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle in fact it's the exact same picture side-by-side so what you're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one but with that one and so your brain is fooled yet again your pattern detection devices are fooled faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes here are some faces on the side of Iraq I'm actually not even sure if this is this might be Photoshop but anyway the point is still made but which one of these looks odd to you in a quick reaction which one looks odd the one on the left ok I'll rotate it so it'll be the one on the right and you are correct fairly famous illusion was first done with Margaret Thatcher now they trade up to politicians every time well why is this happening well we know exactly where it happens in the temporal lobe right across a sort of above your ear there in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus and there's two types of cells that do this that record facial features either globally or specifically these large rapid-firing cells first look at the general face so you recognize Obama immediately and then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes in the mouth especially when they're upside down you're engaging that general facial recognition software there now I said back in our little thought experiment you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa is it just the wind or a dangerous predator what's the difference between those well a wind is inanimate a dangerous predator is an intentional agent and I call this process agent issah T that is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning and tension and agency often invisible beings from the top down this is an idea that we got from a fellow tedster here Dan Dennett who talked about and taking the intentional stance so it's a type of that expanded to explain I think a lot of different things soul spirits ghosts gods demons angels aliens intelligent designers government conspiracists in all manner of invisible agents with power and intention or believe to haunt our world and control our lives I think it's the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism it's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us more moral than us and the narratives always are that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high the intelligent designer is always portrayed as this super intelligent moral being that comes down to design life even the idea that government can rescue us that's no longer the wave of the future but that is I think a type of agent isset II they're projecting somebody up there big and powerful will come rescue us and this is also I think the basis of conspiracy theories there's somebody hiding behind they're pulling the strings whether it's the Illuminati or the Bilderbergers but this is a pattern detection problem isn't it some patterns are real and some are not was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin well if you go there there's people there on any given day like when I went there here showing me where the different shooters were my favorite one was he was in the manhole and he popped out at the last second took that shot but of course Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy so we can't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that because let's face it some patterns are real some conspiracies really are true explains a lot maybe at 9/11 as a conspiracy theory it is a conspiracy we did a whole issue on it 19 members of al-qaeda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy but that's not what the 9/11 truthers think they think it was an inside job by the Bush administration well that's a whole nother lecture but you know we know that 9/11 was not orchestrated by the Bush administration because it worked so we are natural-born duelists our agent is city process somes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these because we can imagine an essence continuing on we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences near-death experiences which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there or you can do it through loss of consciousness by accelerating in a centrifuge you get a hypoxia or a lower oxygen and the brain then senses that there's a out of body experience you can use which I did went out and did Michael Persinger is God helmet that bombard your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves and you get a sense of out-of-body experience so I'm going to I'm gonna end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together it's just a minute and a half it ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief go ahead and roll it this is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm we're hoping that we can use part of this in a national commercial alright and this is a test on some lip balms that we have over here and these are our models who are going to help us turn mad and we have a leading brand would you have any problem kissing our models today [Music] you think that was fine is a blind test I'm gonna ask you two to go ahead and put a blindfold on okay now can you see anything hold up so you can't even see down it's completely blind now right okay now what I'm going to be looking for in this test is [Music] and maybe if you can discern any flavor have you ever done a kissing tested okay now I'm going to ask you to pucker up pucker up big and lean in just a little bit okay [Music] for how does that feel [Music] [Applause] thank you very much thank you Thanks Thanks

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so since I was here last no.6 we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue so we covered that fairly extensively in skeptic magazine we investigate all kinds of scientific and quasi scientific controversies but it turns out we don't really have to worry about any of this because the world's gonna end in 2012 another update you will call so I introduced you guys to the Quadro tracker it's a like a water dowsing device it's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around and you walk around and it points to things like if you're looking for marijuana and students lockers it'll you know like point right to some somebody I'm sorry this particular one that was given to me finds golf balls especially if you're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes well under the category of what's the harm of silly stuff like this this device the a de 651 was sold to the Iraqi government for $40,000 apiece it's just like this one completely worthless in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction which translates to pseudo scientific baloney would be the nice word which you string together a bunch of words that sound good but it does absolutely nothing in this case allowing at trespass points allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay actually cost lives so there is a danger to pseudoscience and believing in this sort of thing so what I want to talk about today is belief I want to believe and and you do too and in fact I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things it is the default option we just believe we believe all sorts of things belief is natural disbelief skepticism science is not natural it's it's more difficult it's uncomfortable to not believe things so like Fox Mulder on x-files who wants to believe in UFOs what we all do and the reason for that is because we are we have a belief engine in our brains essentially we are pattern-seeking primates we connect the dots a is connected to B B is connected to C and sometimes they really is connected to B and that's called association learning we find patterns we make those connections whether it's Pavlov's dog here associating the sound of the Bell with the food and then he celebrates to the sound of the Bell or whether it's thus Canarian rat in which he's having an association between his behavior and a reward for it and therefore he repeats the behavior in fact what Skinner discovered is that if you put a pigeon in a box like this and he has to press one of these two keys and he tries to figure out what the pattern is and you give them a little reward in the hopper box there if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern they will figure out any kind of pattern and whatever they were doing just before they got the reward they repeat that particular pattern sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise once clockwise and peck the key twice and that's called superstition and that I'm afraid we will always have with us I called this process pattern issah T that is the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise when we do this process we make two types of errors a type 1 error or false positive is believing a pattern is real when it's not our second type of error is a false negative a type 2 error is not believed in a pattern is real when it is so let's do a thought experiment you are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of Africa your name is Lucy okay and and you hear a rustle in the grass is it a dangerous predator is it just the wind your next decision could be the most important one of your life well if you think that the rustle in the grass is is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind you've made an error in cognition you made a type 1 error false positive but no harm you just move away you're more cautious you're more vigilant on the other hand if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind and it turns out it's a dangerous predator your lunch you've just won a Darwin Award you've been taken out of the gene pool now the problem here is that pattern is cities will occur whenever the of making a type 1 error is less than the cost of making a type 2 error is the only equation in the talk by the way we have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a type 1 and a type 2 error is highly problematic especially in split-second life-and-death situations so the default position is just believe all patterns are real all rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind and so I think that we evolved there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines are pattern-seeking brain processes to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to so for example what do you see here it's a horse head that's right it looks like a horse must be a horse that's a pattern and is it really a horse or is it more like a frog see our pattern detection device which is appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex it's our little sort of detection device there can be easily fooled and this is the problem for example what do you see here yes of course it's a cow once I primed the brains called cognitive priming once I prime the brain to see it it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it and what do you see here some people see a Dalmatian dog yes there it is and there's the prime so when I go back without the prime your brain already has the model so you can see it again what do you see here planet Saturn yes that's good how about here just shout out anything you see that's a good audience Chris because there's nothing in this well allegedly there's nothing this is an experiment done by Jennifer whitson at at UT Austin on corporate environments and whether uncertain feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns that is almost everybody sees the planet Saturn people that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this which is allegedly patternless in other words the propensity to feel these are fine these patterns goes up when there's a lack of control for example baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they're batting but not so much when they're fielding because fielder's are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time the best batters fail seven out of ten times so their superstitions their pattern issah tees are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth what do you see on this particular one here in this field anybody see a object there there actually is something here but it's degraded while you're thinking about that this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore a psychologist in England who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an ESP test how much do they believe in the paranormal supernatural angels and and so forth and those who scored high on the ESP scale tended to see I only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns here is what you show subjects the fish is degraded 20% 50% and then the one I showed you 70 percent a similar experiment was done by another British psychologist named Peter Berger who found significantly more patterns meaningful patterns are received perceived on the right hemisphere via the left visual field in the left hemisphere so if you present subjects the image is such that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left then they're more likely to see patterns than if you've put it on the left hemisphere our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this pattern issah T occurs so what we're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens Berger and his colleague Christine Moore gave subjects Aldo l-dopa is a drug as you know given for treating parkinson's disease which is related to a decrease in dopamine l-dopa increases dopamine an increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine so dopamine appears to be the drug associated with pattern isset II in fact neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior things like paranoia delusions and hallucinations these are pattern isset 'is there incorrect patterns or false positives or type 1 errors and if you give them drugs that are a'dope Amin antagonists they go away that is you decrease the amount of dopamine and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases on the other hand and feta means like in cocaine our dopamine agonist they increase the amount of dopamine so you're more likely to be feeling a euphoric state creativity find more patterns in fact I saw Robin Williams recently talked about how he he was thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine when he had that issue than that now so perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity dopamine I think changes our signal-to-noise ratio that is how accurate we are in finding patterns if it's too low you're more likely to make too many type 2 errors you missed the real patterns you don't want to be too skeptical if you're too skeptical you miss the really interesting good ideas just right you're creative and yet you don't fall for too much baloney too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere every time somebody looks at you you think people are staring at you you think people are talking about you and if you go too far on that that's just simply labelled as madness it's a distinction perhaps we might make between two Nobel laureates Richard Fineman and John Nash one sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a Nobel Prize the other one also but maybe too many patterns and we then call that schizophrenia so the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern detection problem and of course you all know exactly what this is right and what pattern do you see here again I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here causing you conflicting pattern detection you know of course this is via uno shoes these are sandals pretty sexy feet I must say maybe a little photoshopped and of course the ambiguous figures that seem to flip-flop back and forth turns out what you're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see and I'm and you see the lamp here I know because it lights on here of course thanks to the environmentalist movement we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals so what you see in this in this particular ambiguous figures of course the Dolphins right you see a dolphin here and and there's a dolphin and there's a dolphin this is adult that's a dolphin tail there guys [Applause] if if we can give you conflicting data again your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive if you look down here it's fine if you look up here then you get conflicting data and then we have to flip the image for you to see that it's a setup impossible cradle lusion it's easy to fool the brain and 2d so you say well come on trimmer anybody can do that in a psych 101 text with a illusion like that well here's the late great Jerry Andrus is impossible create illusion in 3d in which Jerry is standing inside the impossible crate and he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal of course camera angle is everything the photographer is over there and this board appears to overlap with this one and this one at that one and so on but even when I take it away the illusion is so powerful because of how our brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns this is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle in fact it's the exact same picture side-by-side so what you're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one but with that one and so your brain is fooled yet again your pattern detection devices are fooled faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes here are some faces on the side of Iraq I'm actually not even sure if this is this might be Photoshop but anyway the point is still made but which one of these looks odd to you in a quick reaction which one looks odd the one on the left ok I'll rotate it so it'll be the one on the right and you are correct fairly famous illusion was first done with Margaret Thatcher now they trade up to politicians every time well why is this happening well we know exactly where it happens in the temporal lobe right across a sort of above your ear there in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus and there's two types of cells that do this that record facial features either globally or specifically these large rapid-firing cells first look at the general face so you recognize Obama immediately and then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes in the mouth especially when they're upside down you're engaging that general facial recognition software there now I said back in our little thought experiment you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa is it just the wind or a dangerous predator what's the difference between those well a wind is inanimate a dangerous predator is an intentional agent and I call this process agent issah T that is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning and tension and agency often invisible beings from the top down this is an idea that we got from a fellow tedster here Dan Dennett who talked about and taking the intentional stance so it's a type of that expanded to explain I think a lot of different things soul spirits ghosts gods demons angels aliens intelligent designers government conspiracists in all manner of invisible agents with power and intention or believe to haunt our world and control our lives I think it's the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism it's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us more moral than us and the narratives always are that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high the intelligent designer is always portrayed as this super intelligent moral being that comes down to design life even the idea that government can rescue us that's no longer the wave of the future but that is I think a type of agent isset II they're projecting somebody up there big and powerful will come rescue us and this is also I think the basis of conspiracy theories there's somebody hiding behind they're pulling the strings whether it's the Illuminati or the Bilderbergers but this is a pattern detection problem isn't it some patterns are real and some are not was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin well if you go there there's people there on any given day like when I went there here showing me where the different shooters were my favorite one was he was in the manhole and he popped out at the last second took that shot but of course Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy so we can't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that because let's face it some patterns are real some conspiracies really are true explains a lot maybe at 9/11 as a conspiracy theory it is a conspiracy we did a whole issue on it 19 members of al-qaeda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy but that's not what the 9/11 truthers think they think it was an inside job by the Bush administration well that's a whole nother lecture but you know we know that 9/11 was not orchestrated by the Bush

you can do it through loss of consciousness by accelerating in a centrifuge you get a hypoxia or a lower oxygen and the brain then senses that there's a out of body experience you can use which I did went out and did Michael Persinger is God helmet that bombard your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves and you get a sense of out-of-body experience so I'm going to I'm gonna end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together it's just a minute and a half it ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief go ahead and roll it this is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm we're hoping that we can use part of this in a national commercial alright and this is a test on some lip balms that we have over here and these are our models who are going to help us turn mad and we have a leading brand would you have any problem kissing our models today [Music] you think that was fine is a blind test I'm gonna ask you two to go ahead and put a blindfold on okay now can you see anything hold up so you can't even see down it's completely blind now right okay now what I'm going to be looking for in this

**Transcript**:
In the 1920's, the German mathematician David Hilbert devised a famous thought experiment to show us just how hard it is to wrap our minds
around the concept of infinity. Imagine a hotel with an infinite
number of rooms and a very hardworking night manager. One night, the Infinite Hotel
is completely full, totally booked up
with an infinite number of guests. A man walks into the hotel
and asks for a room. Rather than turn him down, the night manager decides
to make room for him. How? Easy, he asks the guest in room number 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on. Every guest moves from room number "n" to room number "n+1". Since there are an infinite
number of rooms, there is a new room
for each existing guest. This leaves room 1 open
for the new customer. The process can be repeated for any finite number of new guests. If, say, a tour bus unloads
40 new people looking for rooms, then every existing guest just moves from room number "n" to room number "n+40", thus, opening up the first 40 rooms. But now an infinitely large bus with a countably infinite
number of passengers pulls up to rent rooms. countably infinite is the key. Now, the infinite bus
of infinite passengers perplexes the night manager at first, but he realizes there's a way to place each new person. He asks the guest in room 1
to move to room 2. He then asks the guest in room 2 to move to room 4, the guest in room 3 to move to room 6, and so on. Each current guest moves
from room number "n" to room number "2n" -- filling up only the infinite
even-numbered rooms. By doing this, he has now emptied all of the infinitely many
odd-numbered rooms, which are then taken by the people
filing off the infinite bus. Everyone's happy and the hotel's business
is booming more than ever. Well, actually, it is booming
exactly the same amount as ever, banking an infinite number
of dollars a night. Word spreads about this incredible hotel. People pour in from far and wide. One night, the unthinkable happens. The night manager looks outside and sees an infinite line
of infinitely large buses, each with a countably infinite
number of passengers. What can he do? If he cannot find rooms for them,
the hotel will lose out on an infinite amount of money, and he will surely lose his job. Luckily, he remembers
that around the year 300 B.C.E., Euclid proved that there
is an infinite quantity of prime numbers. So, to accomplish this
seemingly impossible task of finding infinite beds
for infinite buses of infinite weary travelers, the night manager assigns
every current guest to the first prime number, 2, raised to the power
of their current room number. So, the current occupant of room number 7 goes to room number 2^7, which is room 128. The night manager then takes the people
on the first of the infinite buses and assigns them to the room number of the next prime, 3, raised to the power of their seat
number on the bus. So, the person in seat
number 7 on the first bus goes to room number 3^7 or room number 2,187. This continues for all of the first bus. The passengers on the second bus are assigned powers of the next prime, 5. The following bus, powers of 7. Each bus follows: powers of 11, powers of 13, powers of 17, etc. Since each of these numbers only has 1 and the natural number powers of their prime number base as factors, there are no overlapping room numbers. All the buses' passengers
fan out into rooms using unique room-assignment schemes based on unique prime numbers. In this way, the night
manager can accommodate every passenger on every bus. Although, there will be
many rooms that go unfilled, like room 6, since 6 is not a power
of any prime number. Luckily, his bosses
weren't very good in math, so his job is safe. The night manager's strategies
are only possible because while the Infinite Hotel
is certainly a logistical nightmare, it only deals with the lowest
level of infinity, mainly, the countable infinity
of the natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. Georg Cantor called this level
of infinity aleph-zero. We use natural numbers
for the room numbers as well as the seat numbers on the buses. If we were dealing
with higher orders of infinity, such as that of the real numbers, these structured strategies
would no longer be possible as we have no way
to systematically include every number. The Real Number Infinite Hotel has negative number rooms in the basement, fractional rooms, so the guy in room 1/2 always suspects he has less room than the guy in room 1. Square root rooms, like room radical 2, and room pi, where the guests expect free dessert. What self-respecting night manager
would ever want to work there even for an infinite salary? But over at Hilbert's Infinite Hotel, where there's never any vacancy and always room for more, the scenarios faced by the ever-diligent and maybe too hospitable night manager serve to remind us of just how hard it is for our relatively finite minds to grasp a concept as large as infinity. Maybe you can help tackle these problems after a good night's sleep. But honestly, we might need you to change rooms at 2 a.m.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the topic of when Hilbert proposed his Grand Hotel.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of Hilbert's Infinite Hotel, I would say that Question 7 is the closest, but it still does not match the ground truth MCQ. Question 7 asks about the lowest level of infinity that Hilbert's Infinite Hotel deals with, which is related to the concept of Hilbert's Infinite Hotel, but it does not ask about when Hilbert proposed his Grand Hotel.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new generated MCQ that specifically asks about when Hilbert proposed his Grand Hotel would be needed to match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the 1920's, the German mathematician David Hilbert devised a famous thought experiment to show us just how hard it is to wrap our minds
around the concept of infinity. Imagine a hotel with an infinite
number of rooms and a very hardworking night manager. One night, the Infinite Hotel
is completely full, totally booked up
with an infinite number of guests. A man walks into the hotel
and asks for a room. Rather than turn him down, the night manager decides
to make room for him. How? Easy, he asks the guest in room number 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on. Every guest moves from room number "n" to room number "n+1". Since there are an infinite
number of rooms, there is a new room
for each existing guest. This leaves room 1 open
for the new customer. The process can be repeated for any finite number of new guests. If, say, a tour bus unloads
40 new people looking for rooms, then every existing guest just moves from room number "n" to room number "n+40", thus, opening up the first 40 rooms. But now an infinitely large bus with a countably infinite
number of passengers pulls up to rent rooms. countably infinite is the key. Now, the infinite bus
of infinite passengers perplexes the night manager at first, but he realizes there's a way to place each new person. He asks the guest in room 1
to move to room 2. He then asks the guest in room 2 to move to room 4, the guest in room 3 to move to room 6, and so on. Each current guest moves
from room number "n" to room number "2n" -- filling up only the infinite
even-numbered rooms. By doing this, he has now emptied all of the infinitely many
odd-numbered rooms, which are then taken by the people
filing off the infinite bus. Everyone's happy and the hotel's business
is booming more than ever. Well, actually, it is booming

**Transcript**:
In the 1920's, the German mathematician David Hilbert devised a famous thought experiment to show us just how hard it is to wrap our minds
around the concept of infinity. Imagine a hotel with an infinite
number of rooms and a very hardworking night manager. One night, the Infinite Hotel
is completely full, totally booked up
with an infinite number of guests. A man walks into the hotel
and asks for a room. Rather than turn him down, the night manager decides
to make room for him. How? Easy, he asks the guest in room number 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on. Every guest moves from room number "n" to room number "n+1". Since there are an infinite
number of rooms, there is a new room
for each existing guest. This leaves room 1 open
for the new customer. The process can be repeated for any finite number of new guests. If, say, a tour bus unloads
40 new people looking for rooms, then every existing guest just moves from room number "n" to room number "n+40", thus, opening up the first 40 rooms. But now an infinitely large bus with a countably infinite
number of passengers pulls up to rent rooms. countably infinite is the key. Now, the infinite bus
of infinite passengers perplexes the night manager at first, but he realizes there's a way to place each new person. He asks the guest in room 1
to move to room 2. He then asks the guest in room 2 to move to room 4, the guest in room 3 to move to room 6, and so on. Each current guest moves
from room number "n" to room number "2n" -- filling up only the infinite
even-numbered rooms. By doing this, he has now emptied all of the infinitely many
odd-numbered rooms, which are then taken by the people
filing off the infinite bus. Everyone's happy and the hotel's business
is booming more than ever. Well, actually, it is booming
exactly the same amount as ever, banking an infinite number
of dollars a night. Word spreads about this incredible hotel. People pour in from far and wide. One night, the unthinkable happens. The night manager looks outside and sees an infinite line
of infinitely large buses, each with a countably infinite
number of passengers. What can he do? If he cannot find rooms for them,
the hotel will lose out on an infinite amount of money, and he will surely lose his job. Luckily, he remembers
that around the year 300 B.C.E., Euclid proved that there
is an infinite quantity of prime numbers. So, to accomplish this
seemingly impossible task of finding infinite beds
for infinite buses of infinite weary travelers, the night manager assigns
every current guest to the first prime number, 2, raised to the power
of their current room number. So, the current occupant of room number 7 goes to room number 2^7, which is room 128. The night manager then takes the people
on the first of the infinite buses and assigns them to the room number of the next prime, 3, raised to the power of their seat
number on the bus. So, the person in seat
number 7 on the first bus goes to room number 3^7 or room number 2,187. This continues for all of the first bus. The passengers on the second bus are assigned powers of the next prime, 5. The following bus, powers of 7. Each bus follows: powers of 11, powers of 13, powers of 17, etc. Since each of these numbers only has 1 and the natural number powers of their prime number base as factors, there are no overlapping room numbers. All the buses' passengers
fan out into rooms using unique room-assignment schemes based on unique prime numbers. In this way, the night
manager can accommodate every passenger on every bus. Although, there will be
many rooms that go unfilled, like room 6, since 6 is not a power
of any prime number. Luckily, his bosses
weren't very good in math, so his job is safe. The night manager's strategies
are only possible because while the Infinite Hotel
is certainly a logistical nightmare, it only deals with the lowest
level of infinity, mainly, the countable infinity
of the natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. Georg Cantor called this level
of infinity aleph-zero. We use natural numbers
for the room numbers as well as the seat numbers on the buses. If we were dealing
with higher orders of infinity, such as that of the real numbers, these structured strategies
would no longer be possible as we have no way
to systematically include every number. The Real Number Infinite Hotel has negative number rooms in the basement, fractional rooms, so the guy in room 1/2 always suspects he has less room than the guy in room 1. Square root rooms, like room radical 2, and room pi, where the guests expect free dessert. What self-respecting night manager
would ever want to work there even for an infinite salary? But over at Hilbert's Infinite Hotel, where there's never any vacancy and always room for more, the scenarios faced by the ever-diligent and maybe too hospitable night manager serve to remind us of just how hard it is for our relatively finite minds to grasp a concept as large as infinity.

**Transcript**:
In the 1920's, the German mathematician David Hilbert devised a famous thought experiment to show us just how hard it is to wrap our minds
around the concept of infinity. Imagine a hotel with an infinite
number of rooms and a very hardworking night manager. One night, the Infinite Hotel
is completely full, totally booked up
with an infinite number of guests. A man walks into the hotel
and asks for a room. Rather than turn him down, the night manager decides
to make room for him. How? Easy, he asks the guest in room number 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on. Every guest moves from room number "n" to room number "n+1". Since there are an infinite
number of rooms, there is a new room
for each existing guest. This leaves room 1 open
for the new customer. The process can be repeated for any finite number of new guests. If, say, a tour bus unloads
40 new people looking for rooms, then every existing guest just moves from room number "n" to room number "n+40", thus, opening up the first 40 rooms. But now an infinitely large bus with a countably infinite
number of passengers pulls up to rent rooms. countably infinite is the key. Now, the infinite bus
of infinite passengers perplexes the night manager at first, but he realizes there's a way to place each new person. He asks the guest in room 1
to move to room 2. He then asks the guest in room 2 to move to room 4, the guest in room 3 to move to room 6, and so on. Each current guest moves
from room number "n" to room number "2n" -- filling up only the infinite
even-numbered rooms. By doing this, he has now emptied all of the infinitely many
odd-numbered rooms, which are then taken by the people
filing off the infinite bus. Everyone's happy and the hotel's business
is booming more than ever. Well, actually, it is booming
exactly the same amount as ever, banking an infinite number
of dollars a night. Word spreads about this incredible hotel. People pour in from far and wide. One night, the unthinkable happens. The night manager looks outside and sees an infinite line
of infinitely large buses, each with a countably infinite
number of passengers. What can he do? If he cannot find rooms for them,
the hotel will lose out on an infinite amount of money, and he will surely lose his job. Luckily, he remembers
that around the year 300 B.C.E., Euclid proved that there
is an infinite quantity of prime numbers. So, to accomplish this
seemingly impossible task of finding infinite beds
for infinite buses of infinite weary travelers, the night manager assigns
every current guest to the first prime number, 2, raised to the power
of their current room number. So, the current occupant of room number 7 goes to room number 2^7, which is room 128. The night manager then takes the people
on the first of the infinite buses and assigns them to the room number of the next prime, 3, raised to the power of their seat
number on the bus. So, the person in seat
number 7 on the first bus goes to room number 3^7 or room number 2,187. This continues for all of the first bus. The passengers on the second bus are assigned powers of the next prime, 5. The following bus, powers of 7. Each bus follows: powers of 11, powers of 13, powers of 17, etc. Since each of these numbers only has 1 and the natural number powers of their prime number base as factors, there are no overlapping room numbers. All the buses' passengers
fan out into rooms using unique room-assignment schemes based on unique prime numbers. In this way, the night
manager can accommodate every passenger on every bus. Although, there will be
many rooms that go unfilled, like room 6, since 6 is not a power
of any prime number. Luckily, his bosses
weren't very good in math, so his job is safe. The night manager's strategies
are only possible because while the Infinite Hotel
is certainly a logistical nightmare, it only deals with the lowest
level of infinity, mainly, the countable infinity
of the natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. Georg Cantor called this level
of infinity aleph-zero. We use natural numbers
for the room numbers as well as the seat numbers on the buses. If we were dealing
with higher orders of infinity, such as that of the real numbers, these structured strategies
would no longer be possible as we have no way
to systematically include every number. The Real Number Infinite Hotel has negative number rooms in the basement, fractional rooms, so the guy in room 1/2 always suspects he has less room than the guy in room 1. Square root rooms, like room radical 2, and room pi, where the guests expect free dessert. What self-respecting night manager
would ever want to work there even for an infinite salary? But over at Hilbert's Infinite Hotel, where there's never any vacancy and always room for more, the scenarios faced by the ever-diligent and maybe too hospitable night manager serve to remind us of just how hard it is for our relatively finite minds to grasp a concept as large as infinity. Maybe you can help tackle these problems after a good night's sleep. But honestly, we might need you to change rooms at 2 a.m.

**Transcript**:
so Now's the Time to put in your bid for the name for element 117 I think it would be really good to name an element after Richard feineman so you could have the element fem manium with the element symbol I think FY would be quite nice I'm particularly excited about element 117 you might ask why but 17 was the only element in the periodic table when we started this project where nobody had even seen one atom it's never been observed in any form at all so the fields wi wide open and I thought that it would be quite impossible to make a video when we were making videos about each element about an element when nobody's even seen one atom this Arrangement just seems to fall to bits before it can prop form then about 3 years ago our first video wasn't very good there was an exciting result from Russia from dubna where they synthesized the first atoms of element 117 no no it's really exciting because it's it's it's the generation of new matter you know it's almost like a chilas up be spying it's like wow something new something really exciting so those of you who've watched our videos for a long time will know that if you want to synthesize a new element and have your experiments accepted you have to wait till somebody else has repeated the experiments done it a different way and got the same result otherwise anybody could say oh I've seen an atom of elements so and so in fact there has been a case with element 118 where somebody did cheat and the first results were wrong and were faked I explained several times and you may have seen some of the videos how you make these elements you take a sample of a really quite heavy element and the heavier the better and then bombard it with atoms of a lighter element which you accelerate really fast after days perhaps they stick together and you make a big atom in the case of element 117 you choose elements where the atomic numbers when you add them together add up to 117 in this case they used an element 97 brachium and calcium which is element number 20 20 + 97 makes 117 and the atoms of calcium were accelerated in a huge accelerator in Germany at the GSI in damat to a speed that's about a tenth of the speed of light and banged into the sample of beum and created a few atoms now the technical problem is that beum itself is a highly radioactive and unstable element and in a very productive demonstration of international collaboration the bikum was made in America in the Oakridge National Lab and then 13 milligrams that's a tiny bit just almost too small to see just a few grains were transported to Germany in order to do this you can't just have a lamp of buium you have to have one particular isotope a single mass of beum they had beum 249 and this sample was transported to Germany and it's radioactive it has a half life of 330 days so means every 330 days half of it decays away so not only is it radioactive but you have to work quite quickly or your valuable sample is gone before you get round to doing the experiment so they did the experiment the burum was made in the Oakridge National Lab transported to Germany and then it was bombarded with calcium atoms and they looked for the signals for the decay of element 117 and they saw signals corresponding to the sorts of decays that are here on my tie from earlier radioactive elements they've made and the way these elements Decay is that they give off alpha particles these are nuclei of helium atoms and the mass changes in steps of four so the mass goes down by four units and it transforms one element into another and in fact they discovered some quite interesting isotopes of other elements that were formed which had never been observed before during this Decay if pelium is such a pain in the backside and they have to get this tiny sample which decays away why don't they use different elements why don't they use 50 and 67 I think the reason that they use these pretty light atoms is that if they get used bigger and bigger atoms for the Collision there's a likelihood that everything will smash up because the smaller elements are inherently stronger and they don't fragment when they hit the target and so I think if you used um 57 and 60 You' to just end up with a fantastic mess of fragments going everywhere you might make the OD atom of 117 but it would be lost in the noise of everything else so the next stage is that a committee Joint Committee of the international Union of pure and applied chemistry and the corresponding one of physics has to decide whether the evidence is really good enough if everybody is happy then there's the exciting thing they choose the name for the element the the people who get the honor are those that discover the element originally I'm not sure whether this will be counted as the Russians or the Germans but I suspect that everybody will sit down together and there was a huge team working on the latest project I think more than 70 scientists from all sorts of different countries and so now I'm going to put in my bid I think it would be really good to name an element after Richard feineman who was a physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project so he has connections with the oakd lab in where the bilian was made but he's also a huge figure in modern nanotechnology and a founder of much of the research that is being done now so you could have the element f manium with the element symbol I think FY would be quite nice um and that would also serve another purpose because when you see fineman's name written down a lot of people are not sure whether you should pronounce it feeman or fainman but if the element symbol is FY they will all know it has to be pronounced F so my bid for this name is fine manum a group of Russians and Germans aren't going to name it after an American though are they I think it's quite possible that they would because after all the Germans named element 112 after kopernicus who was polish and I think we have got to the stage now where elements are being named after figures or places that have a world role and nationalism is going away and I certainly think that anybody who's read anything about Fineman could imagine that he was a typical citizen of any country he is about the most unconventional scientist that has lived in the last 100 years and also one of the really influential ones as well Professor for the last year or two though I've heard you advocating the name planium we still haven't got planium have you have you abandoned Your Love of the idea of Plum I still like the name Plum but there's some other elements still 115 113 so there's still um opportunities and of course 118 as well but 1177 is an odd number and it's good to name an odd element after an odd scientist I've already got the prize the prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out the kick in a discovery the observation other people use it those are the real things the honors are unreal to me I don't believe in honors

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the periodic table.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the group of the periodic table where element 117 is to be found. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs address this specific question.

However, if I had to choose one that is vaguely related to the periodic table, I would say that Question 1 is the closest. It mentions the periodic table and element 117, although it does not ask about the group number.

So, my answer would be: Question 1.

Please note that this is a very loose match, and I would not consider it a true match. The generated MCQs do not seem to cover the same topic as the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Can you read in the car? If so, consider yourself pretty lucky. For one-third of the population, looking at a book
while moving along in a car or a boat or train or plane quickly makes them sick to their stomach. But why do we get motion sickness
in the first place? Well, believe it or not,
scientists aren't exactly sure. The most common theory has to do with mismatched sensory signals. When you travel in a car, your body
gets two different messages. Your eyes are seeing
the inside of a vehicle, which doesn't seem to be moving. Meanwhile, your ear is telling
your brain you're accelerating. Wait, your ear? Your ear has another
important function besides hearing. In its innermost part lies a group of
structures known as the vestibular system, which gives us our sense
of balance and movement. Inside there are
three semicircular tubules that can sense rotation,
one for each dimension of space. And there are also two hair-lined
sacks filled with fluid. When you move, the fluid
shifts and tickles the hairs, telling your brain if you're moving
horizontally or vertically. All this tells your body
which direction you're moving in, how much you've accelerated,
even at what angle. In a car, your vestibular system correctly
senses your movement, but your eyes don't see it,
especially when glued to a book. The opposite can happen. You're at the movies, and the camera
makes a sweeping move. This time, your eyes think you're moving while your ear knows you're sitting still. But why does this conflicting information
make us feel so terrible? Scientists aren't sure, but they think there's
an evolutionary explanation. Fast moving vehicles and video recordings have only existed
in the last couple of centuries, a blink in evolutionary time. For most of our history,
there wasn't that much that could cause this sensory mix-up, except for poisons. And because poisons
are not the best thing for survival, our bodies evolved a direct
but unpleasant way to get rid of what we ate
that was causing the confusion. It's a pretty reasonable theory,
but it leaves things unexplained, like why women are more affected
by motion sickness than men, or why passengers
get more nauseous than drivers. Another theory suggests
that the cause is more about the way some unfamiliar situations make it harder to maintain
our natural body posture. Studies show that being immersed in water
or just changing your stance can greatly reduce the effects
of motion sickness. But we don't really know what's going on. We know the more common remedies
for car queasiness -- looking at the horizon,
over-the-counter pills, chewing gum, but none are totally reliable nor can they handle
intense motion sickness and sometimes the stakes
are far higher than just not being bored during a long car ride. At NASA, where astronauts are hurled
into space at 17,000 miles per hour, motion sickness is a serious problem. In addition to researching
the latest space-age technologies, NASA also spends a lot of time figuring out how to keep astronauts
from vomiting up their space rations. Like understanding the mysteries of sleep
or curing the common cold, motion sickness is one of those
seemingly simple problems that, despite amazing scientific progress,
we still know very little about. Perhaps one day the exact cause
of motion sickness will be found, and with it, a completely
effective way to prevent it, but that day is still on the horizon.

in the last couple of centuries, a blink in evolutionary time. For most of our history,
there wasn't that much that could cause this sensory mix-up, except for poisons. And because poisons
are not the best thing for survival, our bodies evolved a direct
but unpleasant way to get rid of what we ate
that was causing the confusion. It's a pretty reasonable theory,
but it leaves things unexplained, like why women are more affected
by motion sickness than men, or why passengers
get more nauseous than drivers. Another theory suggests
that the cause is more about the way some unfamiliar situations make it harder to maintain
our natural body posture. Studies show that being immersed in water
or just changing your stance can greatly reduce the effects
of motion sickness. But we don't really know what's going on. We know the more common remedies
for car queasiness -- looking at the horizon,
over-the-counter pills, chewing gum, but none are totally reliable nor can they handle
intense motion sickness and sometimes the stakes
are far higher than just not being bored during a long car ride. At NASA, where astronauts are hurled
into space at 17,000 miles per hour, motion sickness is a serious problem. In addition to researching
the latest space-age technologies, NASA also spends a lot of time figuring out how to keep astronauts
from vomiting up their space rations. Like understanding the mysteries of sleep
or curing the common cold, motion sickness is one of those
seemingly simple problems that, despite amazing scientific progress,
we still know very little about. Perhaps one day the exact cause
of motion sickness will be found, and with it, a completely
effective way to prevent it, but that day is still on the horizon.

**Transcript**:
Element 118, Ununoctium or Uuo, is the last element in the Periodic Table, and it's in the group which contains the noble gases, going from Helium right down to radioactive Radon, so it is going to be radioactive. So far, only 3 Atoms, have been observed. First one Atom then another two. So it's more than Ununquadium, is it more? It's more than Ununquadium, where we had, only one Atom, but  it's still not very many Atoms. It's still arguable whether it will be a gass-like Radon, or it may be a solid, just like some of the other elements, perhaps a solid that's rather volatile. So that it would evaporate easily. But nobody knows. How can you know 118  is the last element, on the Periodic Table? -Well formally, they could be heavier elements than 118, but the electrons, the negatively charged particles, that surround, the positively charged nucleus, are in shells, which gradually go outwards. Rather like the skins, of an onion. So that element 118, represents the whole of a shell, being filled. So we know that there are no more electrons, that can be easily accommodated and if we make element 119, which would be an alkali metal like sodium or cesium, then we would have to put a single electron, a lot further away, from the nucleus. And as soon as you start adding electrons, that are further away, the whole system, is expected to become very much less stable. So if we can only make  3 Atoms of element 118, something that's going to be very much less stable, is not likely to be found in the short time. Though one of the  exciting things about science, is that the unexpected often happens. So, it might be that before  we've started updating, some of these videos, element 119 will be announced. And nobody will be more excited than me. www.periodicvideos.com University of Nottingham Captions by www.SubPLY.com

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that Question 4 is the closest match, as it discusses the expected behavior of Element 119, which is related to the professor's statement about the unexpected often happening in science.

However, the question intent and options are not similar. If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an index, I would say: Question 4 (but with a big caveat that it's not a good match).

It would be better to generate a new MCQ that directly addresses the ground truth question. For example:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I identified the most similar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of electrons in the outer shell of the ununoctium atom. Although none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 9: "What is the significance of the number of electrons in an atom's electron shells?" is related to the concept of electron shells and their significance.

However, a closer match is Question 5: "Why is Element 118 considered the last element in the Periodic Table?" Options: A. Because it is the heaviest element known., B. Because it has the highest atomic number., C. Because its electron shells are fully filled., D. Because it is the lightest element known.

This question is related to the concept of electron shells being fully filled, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ. The correct answer, "Because its electron shells are fully filled," implies that the outer shell of ununoctium has a full complement of electrons, which is 8 electrons in the case of noble gases.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5.

**Transcript**:
so here we have a sample of barium so berium is going towards the bottom of the the group two or alkaline metals so this is a rod of barium we've got in here okay so what I'm going to do I'm going to hopefully if I can get the top off it's really hard I've got four pairs of gloves on here um so it's all quite hard everything's very very difficult to move I'm have to put it down for a second barium is a heavy element I believe that this is a sort of beum or and it's really heavy piece of mineral much heavier than you might expect seeing its size and um where'd you go that I found this just lying around when on a walk somewhere I think it may be be him sulfate but I'm not a mineralist so I may be completely wrong but it's a nice piece and I have it as an ornament in my office I'm hoping it'll come out aha there we go so that's the end of our Rod of barium so what we can do um it's barium is quite soft so we should be able to file a little bit of berium off and we do that so we have some berium starting material so we can react it with things and make berium compounds there it is so this is 100 G Rod of barium I don't think we've used too much so they're probably is close on 100 G there because barium is a heavy element it has quite an important medical use because heavy elements scatter x-rays so that if you shine x-rays on a solution or suspension of barium it looks black and because the x-rays don't go through so if you want to take pictures of the soft part of somebody's body it's easy to take pictures of their bones but if you want to look at their gut or their um throat or their intestin SS they don't show up on x-rays so you feed them what is called a Barian meal if they take it through their mouth or a barium enema if they take it through the other end and you pump in quite large quantities of some barium salt and then when you X-ray them the part that's filled up or just has been coated with it looks black or white if you look at the X-ray and negative which people quite often do so it's very useful for a fairly straightforward x-ray Imaging of people's bodies have you ever had a Barian meal fortunately not it's not meant to taste very nice I think they put peppermint or something into it to pretend that you're enjoying it but drinking a large quantity of berium I think is not enormous fun and people use berium because it's really non-toxic if you took that amount of lead or Mercury you might get a better a picture but you'd be dead so what we should be able to do hopefully cuz this barium is soft we should be able to file a little bit of the barium onto this foil this is what I'm hoping to do let's see if I'm a girly girl now oh I can see little bits coming off actually they're very very small so they're very that was a bigger bit so I'll show you this again in a in a minute but you can see how we're kind of starting to clean off the surface so we're kind of taking that tarnish layer off many elements suddenly become fashionable and in the 1980s late 1980s barium became fashionable as one of the components of the so-called high temperature superconductors a superconductor is a material which has zero electrical resistance and people discovered that a compounds of barium yum and copper barium yum cuprate and related comp compounds when they were cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature 77° absolute minus 196 CRA became superconductors o apart from shaky hands so I've got hopefully some very sort of fine barium turnings now so you can see that okay we have a little bit of tarnish in there but also they we have you know quite a shiny Lester as well on some of the bits so there's my berium nitrate and again I'm going to add some of my combustion mixture now we're using the energy of that combustion of the sugar to excite the barium so that we can observe its emission spectrum or the flame test color again pour it out onto a heat proof mat so again so this time again we saw the same exciting chemical reaction we saw that same exothermic reaction lots of CO2 lots of steam again but this time the flame was colored green and this is the the characteristic apple green which is associated with barium salts so much more exciting flame test all the elements in this group group two have fluorides that are insoluble and they're very nice materials they look like glass and you can put them in water and they don't dissolve and this is extremely useful for technique called infrared spectroscopy where you're putting essentially heat Rays through some sort of liquid to measure the Spectrum how the light is absorbed and especially if you're using water or something that's wet salts of calcium fluoride barium fluoride are really good for making the windows here's quite a large window you can see my eye through it this one unfortunately is cracked so it's no use anymore this is calcium fluoride and calcium fluoride is much cheaper than barium fluoride so if you can get away with it you use calcium fluoride for an experiment the problem is that calcium ions are quite light and the fluoride and calcium ions vibrate in the crystal through thermal energy and these vibrations absorb infrared light barium is much heavier so barium fluoride vibrates more slowly and so it absorbs much longer wavelength light so in a particular experiment if you need to get that region of a spectrum you have to go for barium fluoride instead I tried calling one of my colleagues in the other office see if you had a piece of barium fluoride a barium fluoride window can't find it so you can see calcium fluoride Barum fluoride will look exactly the same but honestly makes us say this is not baring fluoride so we have this one Big Blob and we have the finally divided barium as well okay we're going to try and put that in water and and see how it reacts okay so what's happening is we are seeing um the barium reacting with the water I think our Big Blob is still going actually so the barium is reacting with the water what we're doing is producing hydrogen gas and what I think is probably berium hydroxide um so that's what's precipitating out of solution

so here we have a sample of barium so berium is going towards the bottom of the the group two or alkaline metals so this is a rod of barium we've got in here okay so what I'm going to do I'm going to hopefully if I can get the top off it's really hard I've got four pairs of gloves on here um so it's all quite hard everything's very very difficult to move I'm have to put it down for a second barium is a heavy element I believe that this is a sort of beum or and it's really heavy piece of mineral much heavier than you might expect seeing its size and um where'd you go that I found this just lying around when on a walk somewhere I think it may be be him sulfate but I'm not a mineralist so I may be completely wrong but it's a nice piece and I have it as an ornament in my office I'm hoping it'll come out aha there we go so that's the end of our Rod of barium so what we can do um it's barium is quite soft so we should be able to file a little bit of berium off and we do that so we have some berium starting material so we can react it with things and make berium compounds there it is so this is 100 G Rod of barium I don't think we've used too much so they're probably is close on 100 G there because barium is a heavy element it has quite an important medical use because heavy elements scatter x-rays so that if you shine x-rays on a solution or suspension of barium it looks black and because the x-rays don't go through so if you want to take pictures of the soft part of somebody's body it's easy to take pictures of their bones but if you want to look at their gut or their um throat or their intestin SS they don't show up on x-rays so you feed them what is called a Barian meal if they take it through their mouth or a barium enema if they take it through the other end and you pump in quite large quantities of some barium salt and then when you X-ray them the part that's filled up or just has been coated with it looks black or white if you look at the X-ray and negative which people quite often do so it's very useful for a fairly straightforward x-ray Imaging of people's bodies have you ever had a Barian meal fortunately not it's not meant to taste very nice I think they put peppermint or something into it to pretend that you're enjoying it but drinking a large quantity of berium I think is not enormous fun and people use berium because it's really non-toxic if you took that amount of lead or Mercury you might get a better a picture but you'd be dead so what we should be able to do hopefully cuz this barium is soft we should be able to file a little bit of the barium onto this foil this is what I'm hoping to do let's see if I'm a girly girl now oh I can see little bits coming off actually they're very very small so they're very that was a bigger bit so I'll show you this again in a in a minute but you can see how we're kind of starting to clean off the surface so we're kind of taking that tarnish layer off many elements suddenly become fashionable and in the 1980s late 1980s barium became fashionable as one of the components of the so-called high temperature superconductors a superconductor is a material which has zero electrical resistance and people discovered that a compounds of barium yum and copper barium yum cuprate and related comp compounds when they were cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature 77° absolute minus 196 CRA became superconductors o apart from shaky hands so I've got hopefully some very sort of fine barium turnings now so you can see that okay we have a little bit of tarnish in there but also they we have you know quite a shiny Lester as well on some of the bits so there's my berium nitrate and again I'm going to add some of my combustion mixture now we're using the energy of that combustion of the sugar to excite the barium so that we can observe its emission spectrum or the flame test color again pour it out onto a heat proof mat so again so this time again we saw the same exciting chemical reaction we saw that same exothermic reaction lots of CO2 lots of steam again but this time the flame was colored green and this is the the characteristic apple green which is associated with barium salts so much more exciting flame test all the elements in this group group two have fluorides that are insoluble and they're very nice materials they look like glass and you can put them in water and they don't dissolve and this is extremely useful for technique called infrared spectroscopy where you're putting essentially heat Rays through some sort of liquid to measure the Spectrum how the light is absorbed and especially if you're using water or something that's wet salts of calcium fluoride barium fluoride are really good for making the windows here's quite a large window you can see my eye through it this one unfortunately is cracked so it's no use anymore this is calcium fluoride and calcium fluoride is much cheaper than barium fluoride so if you can get away with it you use calcium fluoride for an experiment the problem is that calcium ions are quite light and the fluoride and calcium ions vibrate in the crystal through thermal energy and these vibrations absorb infrared light barium is much heavier so barium fluoride vibrates more slowly and so it absorbs much longer wavelength light so in a particular experiment if you need to get that region of a spectrum you have to go for barium fluoride instead I tried calling one of my colleagues in the other office see if you had a piece of barium fluoride a barium fluoride window can't find it so you can see calcium fluoride Barum fluoride will look exactly the same but honestly makes us say this is not baring fluoride so we have this one Big Blob and we have the finally divided barium as well okay we're going to try and put that in water and and see how it reacts okay so what's happening is we are seeing um the barium reacting with the water I think our Big Blob is still going actually so the barium is reacting with the water what we're doing is producing hydrogen gas and what I think is probably berium hydroxide um so that's what's precipitating out of solution

What’s the next element? Hassium. I know nothing about hassium, shall
we make something up? Hassium is an element which I knew nothing
about. But now I discover it’s much more interesting than I thought. We’re here in
the German state of Hesse at the institute GSI were hassium was first made in 1984. Hassia
is the Latin name for this part of Germany Hesse and hence it is named after the place
it was discovered. So down here we have the accelerator that accelerated atoms of iron
to bang into a lead target to make element 108 Hassium. Element 108 is actually in the
same group of the periodic table as iron, that much I knew when I first talked about
it. But what I didn’t realise is that the element has a few atoms that are long enough
lived that you can really do chemistry. So once the atom flies off from the back of the
target when it has been created you can pass it through an atmosphere of oxygen and make
the oxide hassium tetroxide Hs04. And the iron of this molecule, this oxide can then
be followed to see how volatile it is and compared with osmium tetroxide. Osmium tetroxide
is a white solid which is quite volatile, it easily evaporates and you can show that
hassium tetroxide does not evaporate quite so easily. But it’s amazing this is an element
only forty atoms have been made but you can tell how its oxide behaves. Osmium has one
of the highest melting points of any element that’s known. The people who make periodic
tables where you have a sample of each element have great trouble melting osmium to make
a sample, so it may be that hassium would have an even higher melting point, it could
be that it’s the highest melting point in the periodic table. But one would have to
make a lot more atoms than that if you were going to find out what the melting point was.
I think people may be able to calculate it, but the melting point depends on the strength
of the interaction between the atoms and unless you have quite a few atoms that’s very difficult
to measure. And quite a few means many tens of millions because even a small particle,
a so called nanoparticle, of metal can have quite different properties from a large lump.

So here, this is a really quite unusual sample
from Goodfellow and you see this is samarium, so this is one of the
lanthanides. Ok so samarium is a beautiful element to work
with as it can change what we refer to as oxidation states very
easily which gives it many more things it can do in chemistry. It’s
also a fascinating element in the sense that we can use it to date samples from
the moon. So this is a sample of samarium and there’s
is a very small amount of it here, perhaps half of a gram. But you know
there's some interesting things we can see about this package because
we can see on this label it says “packed in argon – handle with care.”
Now it’s packed in argon because argon is very, very inert, it doesn’t
react with anything, so it’s used to store, safely, this sample so that
we can get it to carry out research. But I think that this sample has
perhaps become damaged because, I think, the packets maybe broken
because the samarium is gone and all you can see there inside is this
white powder which, I suspect, is samarium oxide, so unfortunately
not elemental samarium, but close. Samarium is also very important because it’s
a neutron absorber, which means it’s got a lot of use in nuclear
power stations. Basically to stop them going ‘boom’.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the white powder, Pete showed us, inside the package which used to contain samarium?

So this a really beautiful sample of chromium.
So chromium is a transition metal, right in the middle of the transition metals series
there and it is used to protect metal components and very often you see chromium plated components
on cars perhaps some of the older cars, you know, the wheel trims or perhaps the grills
on the front, but if you look at the sample it is really lustrous, really beautiful and
shiny. So there are some elements that one is really
fond of and chromium is one of the metals that I really like. It is a metal you would
have seen it in many places it is used for plating materials. This may actually be stainless steel but chromium
looks very similar and it was very popular for plating bumpers, all sorts of materials
in the 1930s up to the 1950s. So you can get dull chromium as well which
is where the surface is very bumpy and the light tends to be absorbed a lot more and
not reflected. My interest in chromium is that in the chemistry
one of the very first bits of chemistry research I did in school was involving copper chromate.
I spent months doing experiments on it. I did not really discover anything about it
but it was great fun. At one stage I had a whole row of test tubes of copper chromate
above my bed and my bedroom at home and more recently when I starting doing doctorates,
I did experiments with chromium, making new complexes of chromium and one of the very
first compounds that my research group ever made, that was new that nobody else had made
before, was a compound of ethene and chromium  - chromium pentacarbonyl ethene so I have

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] thank you very much please excuse me for sitting I'm very old well the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is in a certain sense very peculiar because it's very old roughness is part of human life forever and forever and ancient authors have written about it it was very much on controllable and in a certain sense it seemed to be the extreme of complexity just a mess a mess a mess the many different kinds of a mess now in fact by complete fluke I got involved many years ago in the study of this form of complexity and to my utter amazement I found traces very strong cases i'ma say of order in that roughness and so today I would like to present to you a few of examples of what this represents I prefer to the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity - somebody had had Latin in my long past use means the country of regularity but it is not so regularity is a country of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough so let me show you a few objects some of them artificial other of them very real in a certain sense and now this video is a cauliflower now wider short cauliflower a very ordinary an ancient vegetable because all the ancient as maybe it's very complicated and it's very simple both the same time if you try to wait of course is very easy to wait and I eat it than the way it matters but suppose suppose you try to measure its surface well it's very interesting if you'd cut with short knife one of the florets electron flower and look additi separately you think whole cauliflower was smaller and then you cut again again again again again again again again and still gets more cauliflower so the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property that each part is like the whole but smaller now what did you want to do with that very very little so what I did actually stoom is to study the this this problem and found something quite quite surprising that one can measure roughness by number number two point three one point two and sometimes much more when one day a friend of mine to bug me he brought the pictures it what is the roughness of this this curve I said well just short of one point five was 1.48 now it didn't in any time I've been looking at these things for so long so these numbers are the numbers usually denoted the roughness of the these surfaces hasten to say that each surface is completely artificial done on a computer and the only input is a number and that number is roughness and so on the left I took it the roughness copied from many landscapes to the right I took a higher roughness so the eye after a while can distinguish these two very well humanity had to learn about measuring roughness this is very rough and this is sort of smooth and is perfectly smooth very few pieces are very smooth so then he'll try to to ask questions how was surface a cauliflower well you you measure a measure measure each term look closer it gets bigger down to very very small distances what's the length of coastline of the legs the closer to measure the longer it is the concept of length across line which seems to be so natural because it's given in many places is in fact from fallacy there's no such thing you must do it differently what good is that to know these things well surprisingly enough is good in many ways to begin with especially landscapes which I invented sort of are used in in cinema all the time we see motifs in distance they may be mountains but they may be just formula just blanked on now it's very easy to do it was used to be very time-consuming but now it's nothing now look at that that's real longer now along with something very strange if you take this thing you know very well it weighs very little the volume of a long is very small but what about the area of the lung anatomist were arguing very much about that some said that normal normal males long has an area inside of a basketball and the other said no five basketballs enormous disagreements why so because in fact the area of the lung is something very ill-defined the the bronchi branch from a tree branch and the branch not because in the stop branching not because of of any matter of principle but because of physical concept consideration democracy which is in the longer so what happens is that way we have much bigger long but if it's branches the branches down to distance is about the same for well for man and for a little rodent so now what good is it to have that well surprisingly enough amazingly enough the anatomist had a very poor idea of the structure of the long until very recently and I think that my mathematics surprisingly enough has been a great help to them to the surgeons studying along illnesses and also kidney illnesses all these branching systems which were for which Tourneau geometry so I found myself in other words constructing a geometry a geometry of things which had no geometry and surprising as the it is that very often the rules of this geometry are extremely short you have formulas that long any client it several times sometimes repeatedly again again again the same a petition and at the end you get things like that this cloud is completely 100% artificial well ninety nine point nine and the only part which is natural is a number the roughness of the cloud which is taken from nature something so complicated cloud so unstable so varying should have a simple rule behind it now the simple rule doesn't is not exponential cloud and the sea of clouds had to take account of it I don't know how how it much had advanced these pictures are the old I was very much involved in it but then turn my attention to other phenomena now here is another thing which is rather interesting one of the shattering events in the history of mathematics which is not appreciated by many people occurred about ten thirty years ago around forty five years ago mathematicians began to create shapes that didn't exist mathematicians brought into into self-praise an extent which was absolutely amazing that man can invent things that nature did not know in particular it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane curve the curve a plane the plane and to won't mix well they do mix a man named piano did define such curves and it became an object of extraordinary interest it's very important but mostly interest because a kind of break a separation between the mathematics coming from reality on the one hand a numismatist coming from pure minds mind well I was very sorry to point out that the pure my man's mind has in fact seen at long last what had been seen for a long time and so here I introduce something the set of rivers of a plane filling curve and well it's a story unto itself so it was in 1825 825 an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepares itself to break out from the world and the objects which were used as examples when I was a child and an A student as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality those objects I turned them completely around I use them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature when a man named hausdorff in 1919 introduced a number which was a just mathematical joke and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness when I first told my friends in mathematics I said oh don't don't be silly it's just something well actually I was city gate painter hawks I knew it very well the things on the ground are algin he did not know the mathematics it didn't exist and he was Japanese we didn't have no contact with the West but painting for a long time had the flat side that we speak of that for a long time the Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect and I read the book that mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood this is a mess mess mess Brian loop one day I decided halfway through my career I was helped by so many things in my work I decided to test myself could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something geometrically new well as I looked at at this at this same Cobra emotion just goes around I made it I played with it for a while that may return to the origin then I was telling my assistant I don't see anything can you paint it so he painted it which means that he put inside everything so when this thing came artist stop stop stop I see it in Island and then amazing so Brian motion which happens to have roughly so number who goes around I measured it 1.33 again again again long measurements big bowel motions 1.33 mathematical problem how to prove it it took my friends 20 years three of them were having incomplete proofs they brought together and together had the proof so they got a big metal mathematics one of the three metals that people received for proving things we should have seen without being able to prove them now everybody had asked at one point another how did it all start what brought you in that strange business what brought you to be at the same time a mechanical engineer geographer a mathematician and so on a physicist well actually I started oddly enough studying stock market prices and so here I had this table to this theory and I wrote books about it financial crises increments to the left you see data over long periods with the right on that on top you see a theory which is very very fashionable it was very easy you can write many books very fast about it so the top traveling's of books on that now compare that with the real price increments and when a real price increments well these other lines includes some real price increments and some forgeries chart data so the idea there was that one must be able to undo to how to say a model price variation and it went see me well fifty years ago for 50 years people were sort of pulling this because they would do it much much much easier but I tell you at this point people listen to me this these two curves are averages thunder and poor the blue one and the red one is standard pour from which the five biggest discontinuities are are taken out now the spot annuities are a nuisance so in all of many studies of prices one push them aside well Axelrod and you have little nonsense which is left the Axelrod on this picture as are five Axelrod are as important and everything else in other words it is not Axelrod that we should put aside that is the meet the problem if you master these you master price and if you don't master this you can master the noise as well as you can but it's not important well here are the curves for it now I get the final thing which is the set of which which my name attached them in anyway it's a story of my life my adolescence was spent the German occupation of France and since I thought that I might may vanish within a day or the week I had very big dreams and after the war I saw an uncle again my own clothes very prominent a magician he told me look there's a problem which I could not solve twenty-five years ago and which nobody had to solve this is construction of man named Julia and number two if you could if you could find something new anything he will get your career mail very simple so I looked and like the thousands of people are try before I found nuttin but then the computer came and I decided to apply computer not to new problems mathematics like this legal because that were new problem to old problems and that went from what's called real numbers which two points online to imagine complex numbers which are points in the plane which is what one should do there and this shape came out this shape is of an extraordinary complication the equation is sittin there Z goes into the square plus C it's so simple so drive is so unint sting now you turn the crank one twice twice Marvel's come out I mean this comes out III don't want to explain these things this comes out this comes out shapes which are of such complication such harmony and such beauty this comes out repeatedly again again again and that was one of my major discoveries to find that these islands were the same as a whole big thing more or less and then you get these extra neighbor oak decoration all over the place all that from this little formula which have has whatever five symbols in it and then this one the color was added for two reasons first of all because these shapes are so complicated that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers and if you plot them you must choose some system and so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that another has data on that it's so complicated in 1990 I was in famous you came to see a prize from the University and a few days later a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing so where did it come from obviously from the extra-terrestrial well so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that discovery and received the next day 5,000 letters from people saying but that's simply Mandelbrot set is very big well let me finish this shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics bottomless wonders spring from simple rules which are repeated without end thank you very much [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 6, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 5
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
An enduring myth says we use
only 10% of our brain, the other 90% standing idly by
for spare capacity. Hucksters promised to unlock
that hidden potential with methods "based on neuroscience," but all they really unlock is your wallet. Two-thirds of the public
and nearly half of science teachers mistakenly believe the 10% myth. In the 1890s, William James, the father of American psychology, said, "Most of us do not meet
our mental potential." James meant this as a challenge, not an indictment of scant brain usage. But the misunderstanding stuck. Also, scientists couldn't
figure out for a long time the purpose of our massive frontal lobes or broad areas of the parietal lobe. Damage didn't cause motor
or sensory deficits, so authorities concluded
they didn't do anything. For decades, these parts
were called silent areas, their function elusive. We've since learned that they underscore executive and integrative ability, without which, we would hardly be human. They are crucial to abstract reasoning, planning, weighing decisions and flexibly adapting to circumstances. The idea that 9/10 of your brain
sits idly by in your skull looks silly when we calculate
how the brain uses energy. Rodent and canine brains consume 5% of total body energy. Monkey brains use 10%. An adult human brain, which accounts for only 2%
of the body's mass, consumes 20% of daily glucose burned. In children, that figure is 50%, and in infants, 60%. This is far more than expected
for their relative brain sizes, which scale in proportion to body size. Human ones weigh 1.5 kilograms, elephant brains 5 kg, and whale brains 9 kg, yet on a per weight basis, humans pack in more neurons
than any other species. This dense packing
is what makes us so smart. There is a trade-off between body size and the number of neurons a primate, including us, can sustain. A 25 kg ape has to eat 8 hours a day to uphold a brain with 53 billion neurons. The invention of cooking, one and half million years ago, gave us a huge advantage. Cooked food is rendered
soft and predigested outside of the body. Our guts more easily absorb its energy. Cooking frees up time
and provides more energy than if we ate food stuffs raw and so we can sustain brains with 86 billion densely packed neurons. 40% more than the ape. Here's how it works. Half the calories a brain burns go towards simply keeping
the structure intact by pumping sodium and potassium ions across membranes
to maintain an electrical charge. To do this, the brain
has to be an energy hog. It consumes an astounding 3.4 x 10^21 ATP molecules per minute, ATP being the coal of the body's furnace. The high cost of maintaining
resting potentials in all 86 billion neurons means that little energy is left to propel signals down axons
and across synapses, the nerve discharges
that actually get things done. Even if only a tiny percentage of neurons fired in a given region at any one time, the energy burden of generating spikes
over the entire brain would be unsustainable. Here's where energy efficiency comes in. Letting just a small proportion of cells
signal at any one time, known as sparse coding, uses the least energy, but carries the most information. Because the small number of signals have thousands of possible paths
by which to distribute themselves. A drawback of sparse coding
within a huge number of neurons is its cost. Worse, if a big proportion
of cells never fire, then they are superfluous and evolution should have
jettisoned them long ago. The solution is to find
the optimum proportion of cells that the brain can have active at once. For maximum efficiency, between 1% and 16% of cells
should be active at any given moment. This is the energy limit
we have to live with in order to be conscious at all. The need to conserve resources is the reason
most of the brain's operations must happen outside of consciousness. It's why multitasking is a fool's errand. We simply lack the energy
to do two things at once, let alone three or five. When we try, we do each task less well than if we had given it
our full attention. The numbers are against us. Your brain is already smart and powerful. So powerful that it needs
a lot of power to stay powerful. And so smart that it has built in
an energy-efficiency plan. So don't let a fraudulent myth
make you guilty about your supposedly lazy brain. Guilt would be a waste of energy. After all this, don't you realize
it's dumb to waste mental energy? You have billions of
power-hungry neurons to maintain. So hop to it!

**Transcript**:
An enduring myth says we use
only 10% of our brain, the other 90% standing idly by
for spare capacity. Hucksters promised to unlock
that hidden potential with methods "based on neuroscience," but all they really unlock is your wallet. Two-thirds of the public
and nearly half of science teachers mistakenly believe the 10% myth. In the 1890s, William James, the father of American psychology, said, "Most of us do not meet
our mental potential." James meant this as a challenge, not an indictment of scant brain usage. But the misunderstanding stuck. Also, scientists couldn't
figure out for a long time the purpose of our massive frontal lobes or broad areas of the parietal lobe. Damage didn't cause motor
or sensory deficits, so authorities concluded
they didn't do anything. For decades, these parts
were called silent areas, their function elusive. We've since learned that they underscore executive and integrative ability, without which, we would hardly be human. They are crucial to abstract reasoning, planning, weighing decisions and flexibly adapting to circumstances. The idea that 9/10 of your brain
sits idly by in your skull looks silly when we calculate
how the brain uses energy. Rodent and canine brains consume 5% of total body energy. Monkey brains use 10%. An adult human brain, which accounts for only 2%
of the body's mass, consumes 20% of daily glucose burned. In children, that figure is 50%, and in infants, 60%. This is far more than expected
for their relative brain sizes, which scale in proportion to body size. Human ones weigh 1.5 kilograms, elephant brains 5 kg, and whale brains 9 kg, yet on a per weight basis, humans pack in more neurons
than any other species. This dense packing
is what makes us so smart. There is a trade-off between body size and the number of neurons a primate, including us, can sustain. A 25 kg ape has to eat 8 hours a day to uphold a brain with 53 billion neurons. The invention of cooking, one and half million years ago, gave us a huge advantage. Cooked food is rendered
soft and predigested outside of the body. Our guts more easily absorb its energy. Cooking frees up time
and provides more energy than if we ate food stuffs raw and so we can sustain brains with 86 billion densely packed neurons. 40% more than the ape. Here's how it works. Half the calories a brain burns go towards simply keeping
the structure intact by pumping sodium and potassium ions across membranes
to maintain an electrical charge. To do this, the brain
has to be an energy hog. It consumes an astounding 3.4 x 10^21 ATP molecules per minute, ATP being the coal of the body's furnace. The high cost of maintaining
resting potentials in all 86 billion neurons means that little energy is left to propel signals down axons
and across synapses, the nerve discharges
that actually get things done. Even if only a tiny percentage of neurons fired in a given region at any one time, the energy burden of generating spikes
over the entire brain would be unsustainable. Here's where energy efficiency comes in. Letting just a small proportion of cells
signal at any one time, known as sparse coding, uses the least energy, but carries the most information. Because the small number of signals have thousands of possible paths
by which to distribute themselves. A drawback of sparse coding
within a huge number of neurons is its cost. Worse, if a big proportion
of cells never fire, then they are superfluous and evolution should have
jettisoned them long ago. The solution is to find
the optimum proportion of cells that the brain can have active at once. For maximum efficiency, between 1% and 16% of cells
should be active at any given moment. This is the energy limit
we have to live with in order to be conscious at all. The need to conserve resources is the reason
most of the brain's operations must happen outside of consciousness. It's why multitasking is a fool's errand. We simply lack the energy
to do two things at once, let alone three or five. When we try, we do each task less well than if we had given it
our full attention. The numbers are against us. Your brain is already smart and powerful. So powerful that it needs
a lot of power to stay powerful. And so smart that it has built in
an energy-efficiency plan. So don't let a fraudulent myth
make you guilty about your supposedly lazy brain. Guilt would be a waste of energy. After all this, don't you realize
it's dumb to waste mental energy? You have billions of
power-hungry neurons to maintain. So hop to it!

**Transcript**:
Norman McLaren, the great 20th century pioneer of animation technique, once said, "Animation is not the art of drawings that move, but the art of movements that are drawn. What happens between each frame is more important than what exists on each frame." What did he mean? Well, for an object to appear in motion, it necessarily has to change in position over time. If time passes and no change in position occurs, the object will appear to be still. This relationship between the passage of time and the amount of change that occurs in that time is at the heart of every time-based art form, be it music, dance, or motion pictures. Manipulating the speed and amount of change between the frames is the secret alchemy that gives animation the ability to convey the illusion of life. In animation, there are two fundamental principles we use to do this: timing and spacing. To illustrate the relationship between them, we'll use a timeless example: the bouncing ball. One way to think about timing is that it's the speed, or tempo, at which an action takes place. We determine the speed of an action by how many pictures, or frames, it takes to happen. The more frames something takes to happen, the more time it spends on screen, so the slower the action will be. The fewer frames something takes to happen, the less screen time it takes, which gives us faster action. The timing is about more than just speed, it's also about rhythm. Like a drumbeat or melody only exists when a song is being played, the timing of an action only exists while it's happening. You can describe it in words, say, something will take 6 frames, 18 frames, or so on. But to really get a sense of it, you need to act it out or experience it as it would happen in, well, real time. Now, the timing of an action all depends on the context of the scene and what you're trying to communicate. What is doing the acting, and why? Let's take our example. What makes a ball bounce? The action we're talking about here is a result of interacting physical forces, a moving ball's tendency to stay in motion, or its force of momentum vs. the constant force of gravity bringing it back down Earth. The degree to which these invisible forces apply, and the reason why the ball behaves the way it does, all depends on the physical properties of the ball. A golf ball is small, hard and light. A rubber ball is small, soft and lighter. A beach ball is large, soft and light. And a bowling ball is large, hard and heavy. So, each ball behaves very differently, according to its properties. Let's get a sense of the visual rhythm of each. Each ball plays its own beat and tells us something about itself and the time it takes to travel across the screen. The visual rhythm of these hits is the timing. Okay, let's start animating our ball, bouncing up and down with a simple cycle of drawings. We'll draw a circle here, call it point A, our starting point. We'll have it hit the ground here, point B. Let's say it takes about a second to hit the ground and come back up again. This is our timing. Our spacing is where we position the circle in the frames between point A and point B. If we were to move our ball in evenly-spaced increments, we'd get something like this. It's not really telling us anything about itself. Is it a bouncing ball or a circle on an elevator? Let's look at our footage again and think about what's going on as each ball bounces. Following each impact with the ground, the ball's upward momentum is eventually overcome by gravity. This happens at the peak of each arc. As things change direction, the motion is slowest. We see here the successive positions of the ball are close together. The ball then speeds up as it falls, and is at its fastest when it's approaching and hitting the ground. We can see here each position is further apart. The change in position between frames is the spacing. The smaller the change, the slower the action will appear. The greater the change, the faster it will appear. For an action to decelerate, each change in position must be less than the change before it. Likewise, for an action to speed up, or accelerate, each successive change must be greater. Let's change the mechanical spacing of our animated bounce to reflect what we observed in the footage. Slow at the top, fast when it's hitting the ground. Simply by adjusting the spacing, we've succeeded in suggesting the forces of momentum and gravity at play and achieved a much more realistic motion. Same timing but different spacing gives us vastly different results. And in reality, as a ball bounces, the physics of gravity eventually defeat the tendency of the ball to stay in motion. You can see this here in the decreasing height of each successive bounce. However, again, this decrease varies according to the properties of the ball. Even though these circles are the same size here, they're each telling us a different story about themselves, purely in how they move. The relationship between these principles of timing and spacing can be applied in countless ways and used to animate all types of action: a yo-yo, a punch, a gentle tap, a push, a saw, the Sun traveling across the sky, a pendulum. Animation is a time-based art form. It may incorporate the aesthetic elements of other graphic arts, like illustration or painting, but what sets animation apart is that, here, what you see is less important that what you don't see. An object's superficial appearance only tells us so much about itself. It's only when it's in motion that we really understand its nature.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
How fast are you moving right now? That seems like an easy question. The first tempting answer is, "I'm not moving." Upon further reflection, you realize that maybe the Earth's motion counts. So, a second tempting answer is, "19 miles/second around the Sun." But then you recall learning that the Sun moves around the center of the Milky Way galaxy, and the Milky Way moves within the Local Group of galaxies, and the Local Group moves within the Virgo Cluster, and the Virgo Cluster moves within... "How fast are you moving?" is not an easy question. When Mission Control tells astronauts how fast they're going, there's always an assumed standard of rest. At the start of the voyage, speeds are given relative to the launchpad. But later, when the launchpad is just one more arbritrary place down there on Earth's spinning surface, speeds are given relative to the idealized, non-spinning pinpoint center of Earth. On their way to the Moon, Apollo astronauts had a hard time answering the question, "How fast are you moving?" Speed away from Earth was one thing, and speed toward the Moon was quite another. That's because the Earth and the Moon move relative to one another. Ah, of course! Speed is a relative quantity. When Captain Kirk ask Lieutenant Sulu if the Starship Enterprise has reached a speed of warp 7, Sulu should reply,  "Relative to what, Captain?" Such a sassy reply may get subordinate Starfleet officers in trouble, but it is the only good answer to the question, "How fast are you moving?" This is basic relatively talking. Not fancy Einsteinian relativity, but good old fashioned (and still correct) Galilean relativity. Galileo seems to have been the first person to realize that there is no such thing as an absolute speed. Speeds are relative. This means that speeds only have meaning when they are referred to a reference frame. Presumably that reference frame is itself at rest. But then we have to ask again, "At rest relative to what?" Because even the concept of rest has lost any hint of absolute meaning. Speed is relative, and rest is relative. Earth's speed is 19 miles/second relative to the Sun. The Enterprise's speed is warp 7 relative to the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Your speed is zero relative to your easy chair. But depending on where you sit, it is hundreds of miles/hour relative to Earth's center. When we furrow a brow and ask, "But how fast is Earth really moving?" we imagine Spaceship Earth plowing through the ocean of space as it orbits the Sun. But space is not an ocean. It has no substance as water does. Space is not a thing; space is nothing. Space is no thing. You can move between two points in space, say between Earth and Mars, but you can't move through space. There's nothing to move through. It's like trying to say how much a hole weighs. A hole weighs exactly nothing because a hole is nothing. It's a void, and so is space. To move relative to nothing is meaningless. The concepts of speed and of rest have only relative meaning. They are absolutely meaningless. They mean something only with respect to arbitrarily chosen, artificial frames of reference. If, someday, you are buckled into your spaceship, and you see from the side window, say, a space station whizz by at constant speed, there is no way to know which of you is really moving. Neither of you is really moving because there is no deep reality about constant speed. Constant speed in a straight line has only relative meaning, a kind of relative reality. Does this mean that all motion is relative? No! Some motions have only relative meaning, but some motions have absolute meaning, are absolutely real. For example, constant speed is relative, but change in speed is absolute. Calling something absolute in science means that arbitrary standards are not used in its measurement. It is unambiguously measurable. When your spaceship fires its engines, your change in speed is beyond doubt. You feel it in your stomach, and your ship's sensors can measure it. Outside your window, the passing space station may seem to be changing speed, but the beings inside the station will not feel it. And no sensors can measure it. You are really changing speed, and they are really are not. There's something absolutely real about changes in speed. The same goes for rotation. If your spaceship is spinning, you can feel it, and your ship's sensors can measure it. The space station outside may seem to be going around you, but it is you who feels queasy, not the folks in the space station. You are really spinning, and they really are not. There's something absolutely real about rotation. So, some motions are relative, and some are not. There is no deep reality about constant speed, but changes in speed are deeply real, and so are rotations. We have to be thoughtful in our analysis of everyday experience in order to identify what is deeply real. Since we can be fooled by perceptions as basic as speed, maybe every perception deserves careful scrutiny. This is what inspired Einstein to his incredible insights about the speed of light and forward time travel. Knowing how to identify what is deeply real is tough and important work. If a police officer ever pulls you over for speeding and asks, &quot;Do you know how fast you were going?&quot; an insightful, though perhaps unwise, reply would be, "Relative to what?" And then, as you sit in the backseat of the police car and feel it accelerate toward jail, you can add, &quot;But some things are absolute!&quot;

So this is a very, very special sample of
lutetium. Again from the bottom end of the periodic table, the lanthanides,
and you can see it’s a really quite beautiful metallic foil here. So lutetium is the last of the 4f lanthanide
series and it’s also used for dating meteorites. And, it’s a very small sample. It weighs
a few milligrams but it’s a very, very nice sample, stirred under an inert atmosphere
so that we can control the chemistry, so it’s full of un-reactive
argon so we can’t form the oxide. Lutetium, although it might not be obvious
to you, is named after a European capital city. Lutetium is also used in radionucleotide treatment
for cancers so it’s got a very useful role. And, in fact, it’s named after Paris as
Lutetia was the Roman name for Paris, when it was a Roman city, and therefore
lutetium is one of the few elements that is named after a city. Some
of the other, rarer, are named after cities in Sweden, but lutetium
is the one that is most easily recognisable, at least by people like me,
who had to learn Latin when we were children. Like thulium it is very expensive so we save
it for special occasions. When we know that something will absolutely
work for sure then we will try it with lutetium.

**Transcript**:
Just a minute ago, this oil helped make a delicious meal possible. But now, it's just some nasty goop. What should we do with it? Well, the easiest thing would be to pour it down the drain; that makes it seem like it's gone, but it's not really gone. Instead, it's collecting bits of food and other random stuff, producing monstrous, greasy blockages that clog not only your own drain but entire sewage systems, causing flooding and pollution. Many places have laws for proper disposal of grease, but we can go one step further. Instead of just throwing it away safely, we can turn it into something useful. And if you're wondering what anyone could possibly want with a bunch of digusting, used cooking oil, the answer is: biodiesel. You've probably heard of diesel engines. They power farming and construction equipment, trucks, buses, ships, trains, backup generators, and even some cars. Most of the fuel that feeds these engines is refined from petroleum, which comes from long-dead dinosaurs and other ancient fossils. But diesel fuel can also be derived from more recently-dead organisms, like plants and animals. And this type of fuel is what we call biodiesel. Biodiesel is a biodegradable energy source, made from plant oils or animal fats, that can usually be burned in regular diesel engines. You guessed it, it's the 'bio' version of diesel. It's cleaner than normal diesel, so there has been a push to generate it from crops like soybeans. Now, growing plants for fuel, instead of food, comes with its own problems. But fortunately, we already have some oils and fats right here. Preparing your used cooking grease for recycling is easy. First, let it cool down to room temperature. Then, transfer it to a clean container. You can use any old bottles you have lying around, like milk jugs, as long as they're completely empty, rinsed, and dried. Use a funnel to avoid spills and a sieve to filter out any small food particles. You can even add bacon grease and other animal fats or the excess oil from canned food, like tuna or sardines, just make sure it's really oil and not brine. So, what happens now that your oil is safely contained? Well, many cities have recycling services that will pick up large amounts of grease from restaurants and other establishments. But there are locations where individuals can drop off their containers, as well. All of this grease will end up at a processing plant, where it can be converted to useable biodiesel. How does this conversion work? Well, all these oils and fats you donated are made up of triglycerides, a glycerol molecule connected to three fatty acid chains. To convert fats to fuel, they react with an alcohol, usually methanol or ethanol, which produces long-chain esters and glycerol. To compare, here are some molecules of regular diesel fuel. Now, here are the molecules we created by breaking apart the triglycerides. Glycerol is the odd man out, so it's removed at the end of the process. But look at these esters! If you squint, their structures look pretty similar to those of the long-chain hydrocarbons in regular diesel. And diesel engines, with a few small modifications, can also be made to squint and burn these esters like regular diesel fuel. Et voila! Biodiesel. Now, you might be wondering whether all this hassle over recycling used cooking oil is even worth it. After all, how much energy can it possibly generate? Well, if all the grease that New Yorkers throw away in one day were converted to jet fuel, it would be enough to power several hundred flights from New York to Los Angeles. And let's not forget that using waste oil instead of burning more fossil fuels will limit our negative effects on the environment. Recycling used cooking grease turns goop into good. By contributing a little bit, individuals and businesses can help create an alternative, stable source of diesel oil, while protecting the environment and keeping our cities cleaner. And that's pretty slick.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 11, Ground Truth Question 3, Matched Generated Question 7
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Just a minute ago, this oil helped make a delicious meal possible. But now, it's just some nasty goop. What should we do with it? Well, the easiest thing would be to pour it down the drain; that makes it seem like it's gone, but it's not really gone. Instead, it's collecting bits of food and other random stuff, producing monstrous, greasy blockages that clog not only your own drain but entire sewage systems, causing flooding and pollution. Many places have laws for proper disposal of grease, but we can go one step further. Instead of just throwing it away safely, we can turn it into something useful. And if you're wondering what anyone could possibly want with a bunch of digusting, used cooking oil, the answer is: biodiesel. You've probably heard of diesel engines. They power farming and construction equipment, trucks, buses, ships, trains, backup generators, and even some cars. Most of the fuel that feeds these engines is refined from petroleum, which comes from long-dead dinosaurs and other ancient fossils. But diesel fuel can also be derived from more recently-dead organisms, like plants and animals. And this type of fuel is what we call biodiesel. Biodiesel is a biodegradable energy source, made from plant oils or animal fats, that can usually be burned in regular diesel engines. You guessed it, it's the 'bio' version of diesel. It's cleaner than normal diesel, so there has been a push to generate it from crops like soybeans. Now, growing plants for fuel, instead of food, comes with its own problems. But fortunately, we already have some oils and fats right here. Preparing your used cooking grease for recycling is easy. First, let it cool down to room temperature. Then, transfer it to a clean container. You can use any old bottles you have lying around, like milk jugs, as long as they're completely empty, rinsed, and dried. Use a funnel to avoid spills and a sieve to filter out any small food particles. You can even add bacon grease and other animal fats or the excess oil from canned food, like tuna or sardines, just make sure it's really oil and not brine. So, what happens now that your oil is safely contained? Well, many cities have recycling services that will pick up large amounts of grease from restaurants and other establishments. But there are locations where individuals can drop off their containers, as well. All of this grease will end up at a processing plant, where it can be converted to useable biodiesel. How does this conversion work? Well, all these oils and fats you donated are made up of triglycerides, a glycerol molecule connected to three fatty acid chains. To convert fats to fuel, they react with an alcohol, usually methanol or ethanol, which produces long-chain esters and glycerol. To compare, here are some molecules of regular diesel fuel. Now, here are the molecules we created by breaking apart the triglycerides. Glycerol is the odd man out, so it's removed at the end of the process. But look at these esters! If you squint, their structures look pretty similar to those of the long-chain hydrocarbons in regular diesel. And diesel engines, with a few small modifications, can also be made to squint and burn these esters like regular diesel fuel. Et voila! Biodiesel. Now, you might be wondering whether all this hassle over recycling used cooking oil is even worth it. After all, how much energy can it possibly generate? Well, if all the grease that New Yorkers throw away in one day were converted to jet fuel, it would be enough to power several hundred flights from New York to Los Angeles. And let's not forget that using waste oil instead of burning more fossil fuels will limit our negative effects on the environment. Recycling used cooking grease turns goop into good. By contributing a little bit, individuals and businesses can help create an alternative, stable source of diesel oil, while protecting the environment and keeping our cities cleaner. And that's pretty slick.

This is Ytterbium. Again, a Lanthanide. Stored in a very old  glass bowl. Ytterbium is one of three Lanthanides, which was named after a Swedish town called Ytterby which is where They were all discovered. Ytterbium, Terbium and Erbium  were all derivatives of that town name. The town's done well out of it, hasn't it? -The town's did very well out of it, yeah.  Have you ever been there?  No, not personally. -You should go! Yeah, I should.  It's quite moving, and quite... Quite stirring to be here  in this place because this is  where science and industry  came together, for one of the earliest times I suppose. And quite a significant place  of discovery and economic vibrancy  for the local area.  It's almost spiritual, It's really quite,  quite different. What does it look like? Ytterbium, it depends on  whether talk about metal  or as an element. Often,  Ytterbium 2 compounds as sort of yellows  and oranges. Where did I get it from? From a catalogue. So Ytterbium, it's a rare  earth element, it's a metal. It's a silvery lustrous metal. It's very soft and it reacts very readily  with oxygen to form  a very nice protective oxide layer which sits over the metal. So it preserves itself after a reaction  with oxygen.  It was first identified  or first isolated from a sample  of a mineral which was recovered  from this very quarry, where were in Ytterby near Stockholm in Sweden. But it took a very long time  to make that extraction  and to purify the metal. It's a rare Earth element, It's one of 15. And it's actually the least abandoned of the rare Earths.  But the name "rare earth" makes you think that it's really rare. But if you look at its occurrence  in the Earth's crust, it was a surprise to find  that actually it's twice as abundant as tin. But that said, total production  of Ytterbium is only 50 tons per year. So it's still very little utilized, and that's probably  because its chemistry  is least understood.  And it's least understood  because we really aren't able  to isolate significant meant  of Ytterbium  in the late 1950s. Like many other rare earth elements, it's main applications lie in electronics industry. It's used as a dopant for phosphorus, it's used as a dopant for ceramic capacitors,  and other electronic devices. So really niche applications,  but research is broadening  these applications day on day. The metal itself is really quite unusual  because its properties change as a function of pressure. So it's a metal, so it's a conductor.  But when you push it  under extreme pressure,  say 14,000 atmospheres of pressure, it becomes a semiconductor. And that semi conductor ability  changes as a function of temperature so it's used as a pressure sensor  in extreme environments.  And in fact, one of the major applications as an electronic devices  for the monitoring  sort of measurement of pressure especially within nuclear explosions. So quite a significant element, and quite a recent discovery.  . . . . . . . . . . . .

But the name "rare earth" makes you think that it's really rare. But if you look at its occurrence  in the Earth's crust, it was a surprise to find  that actually it's twice as abundant as tin. But that said, total production  of Ytterbium is only 50 tons per year. So it's still very little utilized, and that's probably  because its chemistry  is least understood.  And it's least understood  because we really aren't able  to isolate significant meant  of Ytterbium  in the late 1950s. Like many other rare earth elements, it's main applications lie in electronics industry. It's used as a dopant for phosphorus, it's used as a dopant for ceramic capacitors,  and other electronic devices. So really niche applications,  but research is broadening  these applications day on day. The metal itself is really quite unusual  because its properties change as a function of pressure. So it's a metal, so it's a conductor.  But when you push it  under extreme pressure,  say 14,000 atmospheres of pressure, it becomes a semiconductor. And that semi conductor ability  changes as a function of temperature so it's used as a pressure sensor  in extreme environments.  And in fact, one of the major applications as an electronic devices  for the monitoring  sort of measurement of pressure especially within nuclear explosions. So quite a significant element, and quite a recent discovery.  . . . . . . . . . . . .

So this is a sample of osmium. Osmium, again,
is a precious metal, platinum-group metal, and this is an
osmium sponge which is very nicely packaged up in this box.
So let’s have a look and see if we can find it. So osmium is another one of the elements in
the so-called ‘platinum group’ and it is quite unusual
in that its oxide – osmium tetroxide is a stable compound which
is really quite easily evaporated. It has quite a strong smell
which is unusual for metal compounds and it can be evaporated
quite easily and it is used in organic chemistry because
if you have compounds with double bonds between two carbon
atoms, osmium tetroxide reacts with it really quite
easily. So here the osmium itself, it is a very, very
reactive metal, it is sealed in this glass ampule under an inert
atmosphere of argon so that it can’t oxidise. The argon
is very inert and it stops the metal reacting. So here you can
see this very dark black metal, very fine spongy-type material,
at the bottom of this glass vial. Again, osmium has played some role in my life
because I did some of the early work in my doctorate involved
osmium compound, it was ruthenium and osmium and
iron. The ruthenium compound was orange, the osmium
compound a rather fetching pale yellow and the iron compound
a very dark green. And the osmium compound was perhaps
the most boring because it behaved in exactly the way
that was predicted. So osmium reacts with the air to form osmium
tetroxide, which is a very, very toxic material, it makes
us go blind so we have very careful with storing the osmium. Since then, I think in my life I have made
one osmium compound that nobody had ever made before,
it wasn’t enough to see but I could see the absorption
of light by this compound, so I was really quite excited. Do you remember what it was it in it? What? Do you remember what it was, the compound? The compound was osmium dicarbonyl dinitrosyl
and it was interesting because nobody had ever made this
compound before, but it was similar to a compound of
iron which was quite well known. The compound of iron looked
like blood; it was a really quite dramatic compound. I never
found out what the colour of the osmium compound was,
I never made enough, but I am not a very good synthetic
chemist.

So actinium: it’s often said about radioactivity
that you might be glowing in the dark if you work with radioactive elements.
By-and-large it’s not true. However, actinium is one of them which
might do that because the element itself glows blue in the dark. And actinium is actually more dangerous than
plutonium, and plutonium was once described as the most deadly and
toxic substance known to Man. So it’s pretty dangerous. I’ll avoid it! Have you had anything to
do with it at all? No, because it’s so dangerous. When I was an undergraduate I saw this book
here, which was written by Seaborg, and I really liked the cover because
I think it looked really nice and I was also quite interested about
the transuranium elements because I didn’t really know much about
them. And he, probably more than anybody else, discovered more of these
elements than any other scientist, probably more elements than most
if not all scientists. And he wrote in this book about the chemistry of
the different elements and, although we consider that these are pretty
radioactive and so on, they at least managed to isolate enough material so
you could see it in the bottom of a small glass tube. It may not have
been bigger than the tip of a pin or something like that, but it’s a
huge amount compared to the one or two atoms that were formed of some of these
elements very near the end of the periodic table.

**Transcript**:
I'm changing my tie to an alkali metal tie.  You have an alkali metal tie? It's a new tie I just got. This one's a Dutch one. I was given it on Saturday  So here you can see we have the alkali metals (And where are they?) Here. And the alkali metals are very reactive.  So, we've seen that lithium doesn't react very much  but then as you go to sodium  and then to potassium  and rubidium  the violence of the reaction gets more and more and more. In cesium it's even greater.  I don't know wether the people making this tie were so frightened that they didn't put it on. But in each of these cases the reaction is removing one electron after another, one electron from the outer shell of the atom, and the bigger the atom, the easier it is to remove the electron. And as you go down the periodic table,  the size of the atom increases so it's easier to remove the electron. So francium would almost certainly be even bigger than cesium, because it's a whole row lower down.  And so, that should react with water with enormous violence. But, unfortunately, francium is very radioactive  and you can't get a nice lump of francium the sort of size that you'd like to throw in water to make the YouTube video of the century.  Francium was named after France, was discovered by one of Madame Curie's pupils in 1939, five years after Madame Curie herself died. I always thought it was Madame Curie herself that discovered it but in fact it was discovered after her death.  But its properties would probably be  similar to those of cesium if it was not very radioactive.  But radioactivity like that makes it very difficult for chemists to study the chemistry in enormous detail.  Chemical reactions are really quite sensitive to temperature and radioactive materials, as they decay, give out energy so the compounds themselves tend to heat up.  A lump of Plutonium, which is very radioactive, is really quite warm to touch. And francium, which I think is more radioactive, is probably very warm. So I think the melting point of francium will be lower than that of cesium because the melting points go down the group,  and because it will be generating heat,  almost certainly francium will be liquid at room temperature. But I've never seen it.   It might well be colored, as well, because cesium is golden colored so I would not be surprised if francium was red.  But I have no idea. And I'm not sure if anybody knows. . . . . . . . . . . . .

**Transcript**:
I'm changing my tie to an alkali metal tie.  You have an alkali metal tie? It's a new tie I just got. This one's a Dutch one. I was given it on Saturday  So here you can see we have the alkali metals (And where are they?) Here. And the alkali metals are very reactive.  So, we've seen that lithium doesn't react very much  but then as you go to sodium  and then to potassium  and rubidium  the violence of the reaction gets more and more and more. In cesium it's even greater.  I don't know wether the people making this tie were so frightened that they didn't put it on. But in each of these cases the reaction is removing one electron after another, one electron from the outer shell of the atom, and the bigger the atom, the easier it is to remove the electron. And as you go down the periodic table,  the size of the atom increases so it's easier to remove the electron. So francium would almost certainly be even bigger than cesium, because it's a whole row lower down.  And so, that should react with water with enormous violence. But, unfortunately, francium is very radioactive  and you can't get a nice lump of francium the sort of size that you'd like to throw in water to make the YouTube video of the century.  Francium was named after France, was discovered by one of Madame Curie's pupils in 1939, five years after Madame Curie herself died. I always thought it was Madame Curie herself that discovered it but in fact it was discovered after her death.  But its properties would probably be  similar to those of cesium if it was not very radioactive.  But radioactivity like that makes it very difficult for chemists to study the chemistry in enormous detail.  Chemical reactions are really quite sensitive to temperature and radioactive materials, as they decay, give out energy so the compounds themselves tend to heat up.  A lump of Plutonium, which is very radioactive, is really quite warm to touch. And francium, which I think is more radioactive, is probably very warm. So I think the melting point of francium will be lower than that of cesium because the melting points go down the group,  and because it will be generating heat,  almost certainly francium will be liquid at room temperature. But I've never seen it.   It might well be colored, as well, because cesium is golden colored so I would not be surprised if francium was red.  But I have no idea. And I'm not sure if anybody knows. . . . . . . . . . . . .

**Transcript**:
I just think it's so wonderful. We always think of these scientists in the past as being saints. And here he is sitting in his office thinking "Hee hee I've made my competitor feel uncomfortable" And in a way it's sad that we lose these bits of information because it makes science seem so much more exciting. We're in the library of the Royal Society Looking at letters about Radon. Radon is the heaviest of the noble gases and in the early nineteen hundreds there was still a big argument about the work and trying to isolate Radon. Radon is given off as a gas in the radioactive decay of Radium. Radium decays radioactively emitting an alpha particle - that's a nucleus of Helium with the mass 4 - and generates Radon. Radon is itself radioactive and decays so you have to have it, as it were, freshly made. Rather like you can only get fresh meat. If you keep it for a long time it decays away. The half life of the most stable isotope of Radon is just over three days so it's really relatively short lived. That means if you have a certain amount of gas, after three days you'll only have half of it. Another three days a quarter of it. And by the time you come back from your holidays most of it's gone. In the days that this letter was written, the way they were getting it was from the decay of Radium. In fact I've read - and this is quite exciting. It's the first time you've ever seen a glass in the library because they're strictly forbidden. - The way they did it was to take a glass vessel and fill it with water. Imagine now you have a container of water with a piece of Radium metal at the bottom. It is breaking down, generating Radon gas and bubbles of this gas will go up to the top. very small amounts of gas, bacause Radium doesn't decay very fast. And so, we can imagine that Rutherford and Ramsay are really competing to get the first sample to characterize it. And because it also contains alpha particles, it will be contaminated with Helium. You've got to realize that these famous scientists were extraordinarily competitive. They wanted to get there first. And they considered the other one, really a bit of a scoundrel. And so there was a sort of competition which is difficult for us now to imagine. And in fact Rutherford was really rude about Ramsay's work. He says, his work - that's Ramsay's work - is all right superficially, on the surface, but when you get down in it you begin to see the nothingness of it all. So he thinks it's rubbish. So this is in a private letter to his friend Schuster - Schuster was his surname -and he begins, "My dear Schuster", because in those days you called your friends by their surnames. No first names; It wasn't right. And this was written on July 30th 1908, so more than a hundred years ago. The reason he's written this letter, is because he's real excited he has got a spectrum of this Radon gas. It wasn't called Radon then; It was called Radium Emanation - Emanation means "coming out of Radium." And he's got a spectrum, and Ramsay hasn't. It was really quite exciting. And so he sent a photograph. And, this is the photograph. So, Rutherford has signed this and he said, "Some of the lines run together in the reproduction" - that's the print - " and ??? they're quite clear in the negative" So, he had an experiment in which he had a small amount of this gas, not more than 0.2 of a cubic centimeter, so it's not very much, in which presumably, though he doesn't say so, he put an electric discharge through it so that the gas glowed. Rather like a Neon sign glows red in a shopping center. And he then photographed this light coming out with a photographic film, using a spectroscope to spread out the different colours. All these gases give a whole series of lines and this is a print of his photograph, because you get a negative in the pho... originally and then he's printed it. If you come close you can see it says the "SPECTRUM OF RADIUM EMANATION" There are actually three spectra here. At the top and the bottom are the spectra of Helium gas as a calibration so that he can see what the wavelengths are. And he's written, all the way down here, the wavelengths of the Helium lines. You can see Rutherford has fantastically good small handwriting, or it might have been his assistant, Kay, who wrote this, because his handwriting looks pretty difficult to read. And then, in the middle, is the spectrum of Radon - Radium Emanation It shows that Radon is a completely separate element. And he's really excited because this is the first spectrum that he believes in. Ramsay claims to have got a spectrum, but Rutherford doesn't believe him. I don't know, because it doesn't say here, whether Rutherford ever published this spectrum apart from just sending it to his friend, but it sounds as if he's going to publish it, because he wrote, "I think Royds" - that's his colleague - "and I, have certainly succeeded in making Ramsay temporally very unhappy." We always think of these scientists in the past as being saints. And here he is sitting in his office thinking, "Hee hee I've made my competitor feel uncomfortable." Do you ever feel like that when you get one up on your scientific colleagues/collaborators/rivals? You say it's a wonderful thing and a human thing. Let me put you on the spot. Do you ever take delight in beating people to things? I don't usually get quite so aggressive, perhaps it's not my nature, though I did get quite excited when I made a compound that my German friend, Friedrich, couldn't and I felt really quite good about that, but in a friendly sort of way. I was not hoping that he would be sitting there, um, crying or whatever, but there are stories of Nobel prize winners tearing up journals or jumping up and down on the journals when their rival has published something else. And I think it's important to realize that it's good to feel emotional about these things because then you may have better ideas. If you're sitting there, cold and calculating and not very involved, perhaps you won't have the brilliant breakthrough that you might do otherwise. I don't know what happened. I suspect that Rutherford became more interested in the structure of the atom and, having got this and so on, lost his enthusiasm or got more excited about something else, because in the end, if you look in the books, it's Ramsay who's credited with discovering Radon, though according to some sources, he didn't want to call it Radon and he thought of a nice name, he wanted to call it Niton for some rather obscure Latin derivation. But I think Radon is a nice name. It sounds a bit like Argon or Xenon and also, it connects it very nicely with Radium. So, as names go, it's really quite a good and understandable name. As far as I know nobody has really studied the chemistry of Radon in much detail but, because it's below Xenon in the periodic table there will be quite an extensive chemistry. You will be able to make Fluorine compunds, probably oxides and a variety of other ones. And generally, as you go down the periodic table the chemistry of the noble gases gets richer and richer. A couple of years ago, Brady and I went to an institute in Germany, in Darmstadt, and they had a display for the public of a cloud chamber. Ok we have a cloud chamber here and I will now inject radioactive Radon gas into the chamber and you will see that there is a lot of radioactive decay going on when I inject it. So now we have to wait a second for the gas inside And Brady and I sat there for some time, watching these trails, which look really very beautiful.

**Transcript**:
I just think it's so wonderful. We always think of these scientists in the past as being saints. And here he is sitting in his office thinking "Hee hee I've made my competitor feel uncomfortable" And in a way it's sad that we lose these bits of information because it makes science seem so much more exciting. We're in the library of the Royal Society Looking at letters about Radon. Radon is the heaviest of the noble gases and in the early nineteen hundreds there was still a big argument about the work and trying to isolate Radon. Radon is given off as a gas in the radioactive decay of Radium. Radium decays radioactively emitting an alpha particle - that's a nucleus of Helium with the mass 4 - and generates Radon. Radon is itself radioactive and decays so you have to have it, as it were, freshly made. Rather like you can only get fresh meat. If you keep it for a long time it decays away. The half life of the most stable isotope of Radon is just over three days so it's really relatively short lived. That means if you have a certain amount of gas, after three days you'll only have half of it. Another three days a quarter of it. And by the time you come back from your holidays most of it's gone. In the days that this letter was written, the way they were getting it was from the decay of Radium. In fact I've read - and this is quite exciting. It's the first time you've ever seen a glass in the library because they're strictly forbidden. - The way they did it was to take a glass vessel and fill it with water. Imagine now you have a container of water with a piece of Radium metal at the bottom. It is breaking down, generating Radon gas and bubbles of this gas will go up to the top. very small amounts of gas, bacause Radium doesn't decay very fast. And so, we can imagine that Rutherford and Ramsay are really competing to get the first sample to characterize it. And because it also contains alpha particles, it will be contaminated with Helium. You've got to realize that these famous scientists were extraordinarily competitive. They wanted to get there first. And they considered the other one, really a bit of a scoundrel. And so there was a sort of competition which is difficult for us now to imagine. And in fact Rutherford was really rude about Ramsay's work. He says, his work - that's Ramsay's work - is all right superficially, on the surface, but when you get down in it you begin to see the nothingness of it all. So he thinks it's rubbish. So this is in a private letter to his friend Schuster - Schuster was his surname -and he begins, "My dear Schuster", because in those days you called your friends by their surnames. No first names; It wasn't right. And this was written on July 30th 1908, so more than a hundred years ago. The reason he's written this letter, is because he's real excited he has got a spectrum of this Radon gas. It wasn't called Radon then; It was called Radium Emanation - Emanation means "coming out of Radium." And he's got a spectrum, and Ramsay hasn't. It was really quite exciting. And so he sent a photograph. And, this is the photograph. So, Rutherford has signed this and he said, "Some of the lines run together in the reproduction" - that's the print - " and ??? they're quite clear in the negative" So, he had an experiment in which he had a small amount of this gas, not more than 0.2 of a cubic centimeter, so it's not very much, in which presumably, though he doesn't say so, he put an electric discharge through it so that the gas glowed. Rather like a Neon sign glows red in a shopping center. And he then photographed this light coming out with a photographic film, using a spectroscope to spread out the different colours. All these gases give a whole series of lines and this is a print of his photograph, because you get a negative in the pho... originally and then he's printed it. If you come close you can see it says the "SPECTRUM OF RADIUM EMANATION" There are actually three spectra here. At the top and the bottom are the spectra of Helium gas as a calibration so that he can see what the wavelengths are. And he's written, all the way down here, the wavelengths of the Helium lines. You can see Rutherford has fantastically good small handwriting, or it might have been his assistant, Kay, who wrote this, because his handwriting looks pretty difficult to read. And then, in the middle, is the spectrum of Radon - Radium Emanation It shows that Radon is a completely separate element. And he's really excited because this is the first spectrum that he believes in. Ramsay claims to have got a spectrum, but Rutherford doesn't believe him. I don't know, because it doesn't say here, whether Rutherford ever published this spectrum apart from just sending it to his friend, but it sounds as if he's going to publish it, because he wrote, "I think Royds" - that's his colleague - "and I, have certainly succeeded in making Ramsay temporally very unhappy." We always think of these scientists in the past as being saints. And here he is sitting in his office thinking, "Hee hee I've made my competitor feel uncomfortable." Do you ever feel like that when you get one up on your scientific colleagues/collaborators/rivals? You say it's a wonderful thing and a human thing. Let me put you on the spot. Do you ever take delight in beating people to things? I don't usually get quite so aggressive, perhaps it's not my nature, though I did get quite excited when I made a compound that my German friend, Friedrich, couldn't and I felt really quite good about that, but in a friendly sort of way. I was not hoping that he would be sitting there, um, crying or whatever, but there are stories of Nobel prize winners tearing up journals or jumping up and down on the journals when their rival has published something else. And I think it's important to realize that it's good to feel emotional about these things because then you may have better ideas. If you're sitting there, cold and calculating and not very involved, perhaps you won't have the brilliant breakthrough that you might do otherwise. I don't know what happened. I suspect that Rutherford became more interested in the structure of the atom and, having got this and so on, lost his enthusiasm or got more excited about something else, because in the end, if you look in the books, it's Ramsay who's credited with discovering Radon, though according to some sources, he didn't want to call it Radon and he thought of a nice name, he wanted to call it Niton for some rather obscure Latin derivation. But I think Radon is a nice name. It sounds a bit like Argon or Xenon and also, it connects it very nicely with Radium. So, as names go, it's really quite a good and understandable name. As far as I know nobody has really studied the chemistry of Radon in much detail but, because it's below Xenon in the periodic table there will be quite an extensive chemistry. You will be able to make Fluorine compunds, probably oxides and a variety of other ones. And generally, as you go down the periodic table the chemistry of the noble gases gets richer and richer. A couple of years ago, Brady and I went to an institute in Germany, in Darmstadt, and they had a display for the public of a cloud chamber. Ok we have a cloud chamber here and I will now inject radioactive Radon gas into the chamber and you will see that there is a lot of radioactive decay going on when I inject it. So now we have to wait a second for the gas inside And Brady and I sat there for some time, watching these trails, which look really very beautiful.

Thallium, because it is heavier, has two different

of chlorine per thallium, or say three, and the different
chemistry between thallium-one and thallium-three. Thallium
salts are very poisonous, and there was quite a notorious

is so poisonous, one has to be quite careful about handling.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so since I was here last no.6 we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue so we covered that fairly extensively in skeptic magazine we investigate all kinds of scientific and quasi scientific controversies but it turns out we don't really have to worry about any of this because the world's gonna end in 2012 another update you will call so I introduced you guys to the Quadro tracker it's a like a water dowsing device it's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around and you walk around and it points to things like if you're looking for marijuana and students lockers it'll you know like point right to some somebody I'm sorry this particular one that was given to me finds golf balls especially if you're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes well under the category of what's the harm of silly stuff like this this device the a de 651 was sold to the Iraqi government for $40,000 apiece it's just like this one completely worthless in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction which translates to pseudo scientific baloney would be the nice word which you string together a bunch of words that sound good but it does absolutely nothing in this case allowing at trespass points allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay actually cost lives so there is a danger to pseudoscience and believing in this sort of thing so what I want to talk about today is belief I want to believe and and you do too and in fact I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things it is the default option we just believe we believe all sorts of things belief is natural disbelief skepticism science is not natural it's it's more difficult it's uncomfortable to not believe things so like Fox Mulder on x-files who wants to believe in UFOs what we all do and the reason for that is because we are we have a belief engine in our brains essentially we are pattern-seeking primates we connect the dots a is connected to B B is connected to C and sometimes they really is connected to B and that's called association learning we find patterns we make those connections whether it's Pavlov's dog here associating the sound of the Bell with the food and then he celebrates to the sound of the Bell or whether it's thus Canarian rat in which he's having an association between his behavior and a reward for it and therefore he repeats the behavior in fact what Skinner discovered is that if you put a pigeon in a box like this and he has to press one of these two keys and he tries to figure out what the pattern is and you give them a little reward in the hopper box there if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern they will figure out any kind of pattern and whatever they were doing just before they got the reward they repeat that particular pattern sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise once clockwise and peck the key twice and that's called superstition and that I'm afraid we will always have with us I called this process pattern issah T that is the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise when we do this process we make two types of errors a type 1 error or false positive is believing a pattern is real when it's not our second type of error is a false negative a type 2 error is not believed in a pattern is real when it is so let's do a thought experiment you are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of Africa your name is Lucy okay and and you hear a rustle in the grass is it a dangerous predator is it just the wind your next decision could be the most important one of your life well if you think that the rustle in the grass is is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind you've made an error in cognition you made a type 1 error false positive but no harm you just move away you're more cautious you're more vigilant on the other hand if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind and it turns out it's a dangerous predator your lunch you've just won a Darwin Award you've been taken out of the gene pool now the problem here is that pattern is cities will occur whenever the of making a type 1 error is less than the cost of making a type 2 error is the only equation in the talk by the way we have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a type 1 and a type 2 error is highly problematic especially in split-second life-and-death situations so the default position is just believe all patterns are real all rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind and so I think that we evolved there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines are pattern-seeking brain processes to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to so for example what do you see here it's a horse head that's right it looks like a horse must be a horse that's a pattern and is it really a horse or is it more like a frog see our pattern detection device which is appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex it's our little sort of detection device there can be easily fooled and this is the problem for example what do you see here yes of course it's a cow once I primed the brains called cognitive priming once I prime the brain to see it it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it and what do you see here some people see a Dalmatian dog yes there it is and there's the prime so when I go back without the prime your brain already has the model so you can see it again what do you see here planet Saturn yes that's good how about here just shout out anything you see that's a good audience Chris because there's nothing in this well allegedly there's nothing this is an experiment done by Jennifer whitson at at UT Austin on corporate environments and whether uncertain feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns that is almost everybody sees the planet Saturn people that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this which is allegedly patternless in other words the propensity to feel these are fine these patterns goes up when there's a lack of control for example baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they're batting but not so much when they're fielding because fielder's are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time the best batters fail seven out of ten times so their superstitions their pattern issah tees are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth what do you see on this particular one here in this field anybody see a object there there actually is something here but it's degraded while you're thinking about that this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore a psychologist in England who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an ESP test how much do they believe in the paranormal supernatural angels and and so forth and those who scored high on the ESP scale tended to see I only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns here is what you show subjects the fish is degraded 20% 50% and then the one I showed you 70 percent a similar experiment was done by another British psychologist named Peter Berger who found significantly more patterns meaningful patterns are received perceived on the right hemisphere via the left visual field in the left hemisphere so if you present subjects the image is such that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left then they're more likely to see patterns than if you've put it on the left hemisphere our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this pattern issah T occurs so what we're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens Berger and his colleague Christine Moore gave subjects Aldo l-dopa is a drug as you know given for treating parkinson's disease which is related to a decrease in dopamine l-dopa increases dopamine an increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine so dopamine appears to be the drug associated with pattern isset II in fact neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior things like paranoia delusions and hallucinations these are pattern isset 'is there incorrect patterns or false positives or type 1 errors and if you give them drugs that are a'dope Amin antagonists they go away that is you decrease the amount of dopamine and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases on the other hand and feta means like in cocaine our dopamine agonist they increase the amount of dopamine so you're more likely to be feeling a euphoric state creativity find more patterns in fact I saw Robin Williams recently talked about how he he was thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine when he had that issue than that now so perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity dopamine I think changes our signal-to-noise ratio that is how accurate we are in finding patterns if it's too low you're more likely to make too many type 2 errors you missed the real patterns you don't want to be too skeptical if you're too skeptical you miss the really interesting good ideas just right you're creative and yet you don't fall for too much baloney too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere every time somebody looks at you you think people are staring at you you think people are talking about you and if you go too far on that that's just simply labelled as madness it's a distinction perhaps we might make between two Nobel laureates Richard Fineman and John Nash one sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a Nobel Prize the other one also but maybe too many patterns and we then call that schizophrenia so the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern detection problem and of course you all know exactly what this is right and what pattern do you see here again I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here causing you conflicting pattern detection you know of course this is via uno shoes these are sandals pretty sexy feet I must say maybe a little photoshopped and of course the ambiguous figures that seem to flip-flop back and forth turns out what you're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see and I'm and you see the lamp here I know because it lights on here of course thanks to the environmentalist movement we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals so what you see in this in this particular ambiguous figures of course the Dolphins right you see a dolphin here and and there's a dolphin and there's a dolphin this is adult that's a dolphin tail there guys [Applause] if if we can give you conflicting data again your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive if you look down here it's fine if you look up here then you get conflicting data and then we have to flip the image for you to see that it's a setup impossible cradle lusion it's easy to fool the brain and 2d so you say well come on trimmer anybody can do that in a psych 101 text with a illusion like that well here's the late great Jerry Andrus is impossible create illusion in 3d in which Jerry is standing inside the impossible crate and he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal of course camera angle is everything the photographer is over there and this board appears to overlap with this one and this one at that one and so on but even when I take it away the illusion is so powerful because of how our brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns this is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle in fact it's the exact same picture side-by-side so what you're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one but with that one and so your brain is fooled yet again your pattern detection devices are fooled faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes here are some faces on the side of Iraq I'm actually not even sure if this is this might be Photoshop but anyway the point is still made but which one of these looks odd to you in a quick reaction which one looks odd the one on the left ok I'll rotate it so it'll be the one on the right and you are correct fairly famous illusion was first done with Margaret Thatcher now they trade up to politicians every time well why is this happening well we know exactly where it happens in the temporal lobe right across a sort of above your ear there in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus and there's two types of cells that do this that record facial features either globally or specifically these large rapid-firing cells first look at the general face so you recognize Obama immediately and then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes in the mouth especially when they're upside down you're engaging that general facial recognition software there now I said back in our little thought experiment you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa is it just the wind or a dangerous predator what's the difference between those well a wind is inanimate a dangerous predator is an intentional agent and I call this process agent issah T that is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning and tension and agency often invisible beings from the top down this is an idea that we got from a fellow tedster here Dan Dennett who talked about and taking the intentional stance so it's a type of that expanded to explain I think a lot of different things soul spirits ghosts gods demons angels aliens intelligent designers government conspiracists in all manner of invisible agents with power and intention or believe to haunt our world and control our lives I think it's the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism it's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us more moral than us and the narratives always are that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high the intelligent designer is always portrayed as this super intelligent moral being that comes down to design life even the idea that government can rescue us that's no longer the wave of the future but that is I think a type of agent isset II they're projecting somebody up there big and powerful will come rescue us and this is also I think the basis of conspiracy theories there's somebody hiding behind they're pulling the strings whether it's the Illuminati or the Bilderbergers but this is a pattern detection problem isn't it some patterns are real and some are not was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin well if you go there there's people there on any given day like when I went there here showing me where the different shooters were my favorite one was he was in the manhole and he popped out at the last second took that shot but of course Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy so we can't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that because let's face it some patterns are real some conspiracies really are true explains a lot maybe at 9/11 as a conspiracy theory it is a conspiracy we did a whole issue on it 19 members of al-qaeda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy but that's not what the 9/11 truthers think they think it was an inside job by the Bush administration well that's a whole nother lecture but you know we know that 9/11 was not orchestrated by the Bush administration because it worked so we are natural-born duelists our agent is city process somes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these because we can imagine an essence continuing on we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences near-death experiences which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there or you can do it through loss of consciousness by accelerating in a centrifuge you get a hypoxia or a lower oxygen and the brain then senses that there's a out of body experience you can use which I did went out and did Michael Persinger is God helmet that bombard your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves and you get a sense of out-of-body experience so I'm going to I'm gonna end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together it's just a minute and a half it ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief go ahead and roll it this is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm we're hoping that we can use part of this in a national commercial alright and this is a test on some lip balms that we have over here and these are our models who are going to help us turn mad and we have a leading brand would you have any problem kissing our models today [Music] you think that was fine is a blind test I'm gonna ask you two to go ahead and put a blindfold on okay now can you see anything hold up so you can't even see down it's completely blind now right okay now what I'm going to be looking for in this test is [Music] and maybe if you can discern any flavor have you ever done a kissing tested okay now I'm going to ask you to pucker up pucker up big and lean in just a little bit okay [Music] for how does that feel [Music] [Applause] thank you very much thank you Thanks Thanks

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so since I was here last no.6 we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue so we covered that fairly extensively in skeptic magazine we investigate all kinds of scientific and quasi scientific controversies but it turns out we don't really have to worry about any of this because the world's gonna end in 2012 another update you will call so I introduced you guys to the Quadro tracker it's a like a water dowsing device it's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around and you walk around and it points to things like if you're looking for marijuana and students lockers it'll you know like point right to some somebody I'm sorry this particular one that was given to me finds golf balls especially if you're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes well under the category of what's the harm of silly stuff like this this device the a de 651 was sold to the Iraqi government for $40,000 apiece it's just like this one completely worthless in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction which translates to pseudo scientific baloney would be the nice word which you string together a bunch of words that sound good but it does absolutely nothing in this case allowing at trespass points allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay actually cost lives so there is a danger to pseudoscience and believing in this sort of thing so what I want to talk about today is belief I want to believe and and you do too and in fact I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things it is the default option we just believe we believe all sorts of things belief is natural disbelief skepticism science is not natural it's it's more difficult it's uncomfortable to not believe things so like Fox Mulder on x-files who wants to believe in UFOs what we all do and the reason for that is because we are we have a belief engine in our brains essentially we are pattern-seeking primates we connect the dots a is connected to B B is connected to C and sometimes they really is connected to B and that's called association learning we find patterns we make those connections whether it's Pavlov's dog here associating the sound of the Bell with the food and then he celebrates to the sound of the Bell or whether it's thus Canarian rat in which he's having an association between his behavior and a reward for it and therefore he repeats the behavior in fact what Skinner discovered is that if you put a pigeon in a box like this and he has to press one of these two keys and he tries to figure out what the pattern is and you give them a little reward in the hopper box there if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern they will figure out any kind of pattern and whatever they were doing just before they got the reward they repeat that particular pattern sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise once clockwise and peck the key twice and that's called superstition and that I'm afraid we will always have with us I called this process pattern issah T that is the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise when we do this process we make two types of errors a type 1 error or false positive is believing a pattern is real when it's not our second type of error is a false negative a type 2 error is not believed in a pattern is real when it is so let's do a thought experiment you are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of Africa your name is Lucy okay and and you hear a rustle in the grass is it a dangerous predator is it just the wind your next decision could be the most important one of your life well if you think that the rustle in the grass is is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind you've made an error in cognition you made a type 1 error false positive but no harm you just move away you're more cautious you're more vigilant on the other hand if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind and it turns out it's a dangerous predator your lunch you've just won a Darwin Award you've been taken out of the gene pool now the problem here is that pattern is cities will occur whenever the of making a type 1 error is less than the cost of making a type 2 error is the only equation in the talk by the way we have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a type 1 and a type 2 error is highly problematic especially in split-second life-and-death situations so the default position is just believe all patterns are real all rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind and so I think that we evolved there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines are pattern-seeking brain processes to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to so for example what do you see here it's a horse head that's right it looks like a horse must be a horse that's a pattern and is it really a horse or is it more like a frog see our

what pattern do you see here again I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here causing you conflicting pattern detection you know of course this is via uno shoes these are sandals pretty sexy feet I must say maybe a little photoshopped and of course the ambiguous figures that seem to flip-flop back and forth turns out what you're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so since I was here last no.6 we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue so we covered that fairly extensively in skeptic magazine we investigate all kinds of scientific and quasi scientific controversies but it turns out we don't really have to worry about any of this because the world's gonna end in 2012 another update you will call so I introduced you guys to the Quadro tracker it's a like a water dowsing device it's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around and you walk around and it points to things like if you're looking for marijuana and students lockers it'll you know like point right to some somebody I'm sorry this particular one that was given to me finds golf balls especially if you're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes well under the category of what's the harm of silly stuff like this this device the a de 651 was sold to the Iraqi government for $40,000 apiece it's just like this one completely worthless in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction which translates to pseudo scientific baloney would be the nice word which you string together a bunch of words that sound good but it does absolutely nothing in this case allowing at trespass points allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay actually cost lives so there is a danger to pseudoscience and believing in this sort of thing so what I want to talk about today is belief I want to believe and and you do too and in fact I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things it is the default option we just believe we believe all sorts of things belief is natural disbelief skepticism science is not natural it's it's more difficult it's uncomfortable to not believe things so like Fox Mulder on x-files who wants to believe in UFOs what we all do and the reason for that is because we are we have a belief engine in our brains essentially we are pattern-seeking primates we connect the dots a is connected to B B is connected to C and sometimes they really is connected to B and that's called association learning we find patterns we make those connections whether it's Pavlov's dog here associating the sound of the Bell with the food and then he celebrates to the sound of the Bell or whether it's thus Canarian rat in which he's having an association between his behavior and a reward for it and therefore he repeats the behavior in fact what Skinner discovered is that if you put a pigeon in a box like this and he has to press one of these two keys and he tries to figure out what the pattern is and you give them a little reward in the hopper box there if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern they will figure out any kind of pattern and whatever they were doing just before they got the reward they repeat that particular pattern sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise once clockwise and peck the key twice and that's called superstition and that I'm afraid we will always have with us I called this process pattern issah T that is the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise when we do this process we make two types of errors a type 1 error or false positive is believing a pattern is real when it's not our second type of error is a false negative a type 2 error is not believed in a pattern is real when it is so let's do a thought experiment you are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of Africa your name is Lucy okay and and you hear a rustle in the grass is it a dangerous predator is it just the wind your next decision could be the most important one of your life well if you think that the rustle in the grass is is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind you've made an error in cognition you made a type 1 error false positive but no harm you just move away you're more cautious you're more vigilant on the other hand if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind and it turns out it's a dangerous predator your lunch you've just won a Darwin Award you've been taken out of the gene pool now the problem here is that pattern is cities will occur whenever the of making a type 1 error is less than the cost of making a type 2 error is the only equation in the talk by the way we have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a type 1 and a type 2 error is highly problematic especially in split-second life-and-death situations so the default position is just believe all patterns are real all rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind and so I think that we evolved there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines are pattern-seeking brain processes to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to so for example what do you see here it's a horse head that's right it looks like a horse must be a horse that's a pattern and is it really a horse or is it more like a frog see our pattern detection device which is appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex it's our little sort of detection device there can be easily fooled and this is the problem for example what do you see here yes of course it's a cow once I primed the brains called cognitive priming once I prime the brain to see it it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it and what do you see here some people see a Dalmatian dog yes there it is and there's the prime so when I go back without the prime your brain already has the model so you can see it again what do you see here planet Saturn yes that's good how about here just shout out anything you see that's a good audience Chris because there's nothing in this well allegedly there's nothing this is an experiment done by Jennifer whitson at at UT Austin on corporate environments and whether uncertain feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns that is almost everybody sees the planet Saturn people that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this which is allegedly patternless in other words the propensity to feel these are fine these patterns goes up when there's a lack of control for example baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they're batting but not so much when they're fielding because fielder's are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time the best batters fail seven out of ten times so their superstitions their pattern issah tees are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth what do you see on this particular one here in this field anybody see a object there there actually is something here but it's degraded while you're thinking about that this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore a psychologist in England who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an ESP test how much do they believe in the paranormal supernatural angels and and so forth and those who scored high on the ESP scale tended to see I only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns here is what you show subjects the fish is degraded 20% 50% and then the one I showed you 70 percent a similar experiment was done by another British psychologist named Peter Berger who found significantly more patterns meaningful patterns are received perceived on the right hemisphere via the left visual field in the left hemisphere so if you present subjects the image is such that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left then they're more likely to see patterns than if you've put it on the left hemisphere our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this pattern issah T occurs so what we're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens Berger and his colleague Christine Moore gave subjects Aldo l-dopa is a drug as you know given for treating parkinson's disease which is related to a decrease in dopamine l-dopa increases dopamine an increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine so dopamine appears to be the drug associated with pattern isset II in fact neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior things like paranoia delusions and hallucinations these are pattern isset 'is there incorrect patterns or false positives or type 1 errors and if you give them drugs that are a'dope Amin antagonists they go away that is you decrease the amount of dopamine and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases on the other hand and feta means like in cocaine our dopamine agonist they increase the amount of dopamine so you're more likely to be feeling a euphoric state creativity find more patterns in fact I saw Robin Williams recently talked about how he he was thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine when he had that issue than that now so perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity dopamine I think changes our signal-to-noise ratio that is how accurate we are in finding patterns if it's too low you're more likely to make too many type 2 errors you missed the real patterns you don't want to be too skeptical if you're too skeptical you miss the really interesting good ideas just right you're creative and yet you don't fall for too much baloney too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere every time somebody looks at you you think people are staring at you you think people are talking about you and if you go too far on that that's just simply labelled as madness it's a distinction perhaps we might make between two Nobel laureates Richard Fineman and John Nash one sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a Nobel Prize the other one also but maybe too many patterns and we then call that schizophrenia so the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern detection problem and of course you all know exactly what this is right and what pattern do you see here again I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here causing you conflicting pattern detection you know of course this is via uno shoes these are sandals pretty sexy feet I must say maybe a little photoshopped and of course the ambiguous figures that seem to flip-flop back and forth turns out what you're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see and I'm and you see the lamp here I know because it lights on here of course thanks to the environmentalist movement we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals so what you see in this in this particular ambiguous figures of course the Dolphins right you see a dolphin here and and there's a dolphin and there's a dolphin this is adult that's a dolphin tail there guys [Applause] if if we can give you conflicting data again your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive if you look down here it's fine if you look up here then you get conflicting data and then we have to flip the image for you to see that it's a setup impossible cradle lusion it's easy to fool the brain and 2d so you say well come on trimmer anybody can do that in a psych 101 text with a illusion like that well here's the late great Jerry Andrus is impossible create illusion in 3d in which Jerry is standing inside the impossible crate and he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal of course camera angle is everything the photographer is over there and this board appears to overlap with this one and this one at that one and so on but even when I take it away the illusion is so powerful because of how our brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns this is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle in fact it's the exact same picture side-by-side so what you're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one but with that one and so your brain is fooled yet again your pattern detection devices are fooled faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes here are some faces on the side of Iraq I'm actually not even sure if this is this might be Photoshop but anyway the point is still made but which one of these looks odd to you in a quick reaction which one looks odd the one on the left ok I'll rotate it so it'll be the one on the right and you are correct fairly famous illusion was first done with Margaret Thatcher now they trade up to politicians every time well why is this happening well we know exactly where it happens in the temporal lobe right across a sort of above your ear there in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus and there's two types of cells that do this that record facial features either globally or specifically these large rapid-firing cells first look at the general face so you recognize Obama immediately and then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes in the mouth especially when they're upside down you're engaging that general facial recognition software there now I said back in our little thought experiment you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa is it just the wind or a dangerous predator what's the difference between those well a wind is inanimate a dangerous predator is an intentional agent and I call this process agent issah T that is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning and tension and agency often invisible beings from the top down this is an idea that we got from a fellow tedster here Dan Dennett who talked about and taking the intentional stance so it's a type of that expanded to explain I think a lot of different things soul spirits ghosts gods demons angels aliens intelligent designers government conspiracists in all manner of invisible agents with power and intention or believe to haunt our world and control our lives I think it's the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism it's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us more moral than us and the narratives always are that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high the intelligent designer is always portrayed as this super intelligent moral being that comes down to design life even the idea that government can rescue us that's no longer the wave of the future but that is I think a type of agent isset II they're projecting somebody up there big and powerful will come rescue us and this is also I think the basis of conspiracy theories there's somebody hiding behind they're pulling the strings whether it's the Illuminati or the Bilderbergers but this is a pattern detection problem isn't it some patterns are real and some are not was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin well if you go there there's people there on any given day like when I went there here showing me where the different shooters were my favorite one was he was in the manhole and he popped out at the last second took that shot but of course Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy so we can't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that because let's face it some patterns are real some conspiracies really are true explains a lot maybe at 9/11 as a conspiracy theory it is a conspiracy we did a whole issue on it 19 members of al-qaeda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy but that's not what the 9/11 truthers think they think it was an inside job by the Bush administration well that's a whole nother lecture but you know we know that 9/11 was not orchestrated by the Bush administration because it worked so we are natural-born duelists our agent is city process somes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these because we can imagine an essence continuing on we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences near-death experiences which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there or you can do it through loss of consciousness by accelerating in a centrifuge you get a hypoxia or a lower oxygen and the brain then senses that there's a out of body experience you can use which I did went out and did Michael Persinger is God helmet that bombard your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves and you get a sense of out-of-body experience so I'm going to I'm gonna end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together it's just a minute and a half it ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief go ahead and roll it this is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm we're hoping that we can use part of this in a national commercial alright and this is a test on some lip balms that we have over here and these are our models who are going to help us turn mad and we have a leading brand would you have any problem kissing our models today [Music] you think that was fine is a blind test I'm gonna ask you two to go ahead and put a blindfold on okay now can you see anything hold up so you can't even see down it's completely blind now right okay now what I'm going to be looking for in this test is [Music] and maybe if you can discern any flavor have you ever done a kissing tested okay now I'm going to ask you to pucker up pucker up big and lean in just a little bit okay [Music] for how does that feel [Music] [Applause] thank you very much thank you Thanks Thanks

**Transcript**:
In the 1920's, the German mathematician David Hilbert devised a famous thought experiment to show us just how hard it is to wrap our minds
around the concept of infinity. Imagine a hotel with an infinite
number of rooms and a very hardworking night manager. One night, the Infinite Hotel
is completely full, totally booked up
with an infinite number of guests. A man walks into the hotel
and asks for a room. Rather than turn him down, the night manager decides
to make room for him. How? Easy, he asks the guest in room number 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on. Every guest moves from room number "n" to room number "n+1". Since there are an infinite
number of rooms, there is a new room
for each existing guest. This leaves room 1 open
for the new customer. The process can be repeated for any finite number of new guests. If, say, a tour bus unloads
40 new people looking for rooms, then every existing guest just moves from room number "n" to room number "n+40", thus, opening up the first 40 rooms. But now an infinitely large bus with a countably infinite
number of passengers pulls up to rent rooms. countably infinite is the key. Now, the infinite bus
of infinite passengers perplexes the night manager at first, but he realizes there's a way to place each new person. He asks the guest in room 1
to move to room 2. He then asks the guest in room 2 to move to room 4, the guest in room 3 to move to room 6, and so on. Each current guest moves
from room number "n" to room number "2n" -- filling up only the infinite
even-numbered rooms. By doing this, he has now emptied all of the infinitely many
odd-numbered rooms, which are then taken by the people
filing off the infinite bus. Everyone's happy and the hotel's business
is booming more than ever. Well, actually, it is booming
exactly the same amount as ever, banking an infinite number
of dollars a night. Word spreads about this incredible hotel. People pour in from far and wide. One night, the unthinkable happens. The night manager looks outside and sees an infinite line
of infinitely large buses, each with a countably infinite
number of passengers. What can he do? If he cannot find rooms for them,
the hotel will lose out on an infinite amount of money, and he will surely lose his job. Luckily, he remembers
that around the year 300 B.C.E., Euclid proved that there
is an infinite quantity of prime numbers. So, to accomplish this
seemingly impossible task of finding infinite beds
for infinite buses of infinite weary travelers, the night manager assigns
every current guest to the first prime number, 2, raised to the power
of their current room number. So, the current occupant of room number 7 goes to room number 2^7, which is room 128. The night manager then takes the people
on the first of the infinite buses and assigns them to the room number of the next prime, 3, raised to the power of their seat
number on the bus. So, the person in seat
number 7 on the first bus goes to room number 3^7 or room number 2,187. This continues for all of the first bus. The passengers on the second bus are assigned powers of the next prime, 5. The following bus, powers of 7. Each bus follows: powers of 11, powers of 13, powers of 17, etc. Since each of these numbers only has 1 and the natural number powers of their prime number base as factors, there are no overlapping room numbers. All the buses' passengers
fan out into rooms using unique room-assignment schemes based on unique prime numbers. In this way, the night
manager can accommodate every passenger on every bus. Although, there will be
many rooms that go unfilled, like room 6, since 6 is not a power
of any prime number. Luckily, his bosses
weren't very good in math, so his job is safe. The night manager's strategies
are only possible because while the Infinite Hotel
is certainly a logistical nightmare, it only deals with the lowest
level of infinity, mainly, the countable infinity
of the natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. Georg Cantor called this level
of infinity aleph-zero. We use natural numbers
for the room numbers as well as the seat numbers on the buses. If we were dealing
with higher orders of infinity, such as that of the real numbers, these structured strategies
would no longer be possible as we have no way
to systematically include every number. The Real Number Infinite Hotel has negative number rooms in the basement, fractional rooms, so the guy in room 1/2 always suspects he has less room than the guy in room 1. Square root rooms, like room radical 2, and room pi, where the guests expect free dessert. What self-respecting night manager
would ever want to work there even for an infinite salary? But over at Hilbert's Infinite Hotel, where there's never any vacancy and always room for more, the scenarios faced by the ever-diligent and maybe too hospitable night manager serve to remind us of just how hard it is for our relatively finite minds to grasp a concept as large as infinity. Maybe you can help tackle these problems after a good night's sleep. But honestly, we might need you to change rooms at 2 a.m.

of their current room number. So, the current occupant of room number 7 goes to room number 2^7, which is room 128. The night manager then takes the people
on the first of the infinite buses and assigns them to the room number of the next prime, 3, raised to the power of their seat
number on the bus. So, the person in seat
number 7 on the first bus goes to room number 3^7 or room number 2,187. This continues for all of the first bus. The passengers on the second bus are assigned powers of the next prime, 5. The following bus, powers of 7. Each bus follows: powers of 11, powers of 13, powers of 17, etc. Since each of these numbers only has 1 and the natural number powers of their prime number base as factors, there are no overlapping room numbers. All the buses' passengers
fan out into rooms using unique room-assignment schemes based on unique prime numbers. In this way, the night
manager can accommodate every passenger on every bus. Although, there will be
many rooms that go unfilled, like room 6, since 6 is not a power
of any prime number. Luckily, his bosses
weren't very good in math, so his job is safe. The night manager's strategies
are only possible because while the Infinite Hotel
is certainly a logistical nightmare, it only deals with the lowest
level of infinity, mainly, the countable infinity
of the natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. Georg Cantor called this level
of infinity aleph-zero. We use natural numbers
for the room numbers as well as the seat numbers on the buses. If we were dealing
with higher orders of infinity, such as that of the real numbers, these structured strategies
would no longer be possible as we have no way
to systematically include every number. The Real Number Infinite Hotel has negative number rooms in the basement, fractional rooms, so the guy in room 1/2 always suspects he has less room than the guy in room 1. Square root rooms, like room radical 2, and room pi, where the guests expect free dessert. What self-respecting night manager

**Transcript**:
In the 1920's, the German mathematician David Hilbert devised a famous thought experiment to show us just how hard it is to wrap our minds
around the concept of infinity. Imagine a hotel with an infinite
number of rooms and a very hardworking night manager. One night, the Infinite Hotel
is completely full, totally booked up
with an infinite number of guests. A man walks into the hotel
and asks for a room. Rather than turn him down, the night manager decides
to make room for him. How? Easy, he asks the guest in room number 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on. Every guest moves from room number "n" to room number "n+1". Since there are an infinite
number of rooms, there is a new room
for each existing guest. This leaves room 1 open
for the new customer. The process can be repeated for any finite number of new guests. If, say, a tour bus unloads
40 new people looking for rooms, then every existing guest just moves from room number "n" to room number "n+40", thus, opening up the first 40 rooms. But now an infinitely large bus with a countably infinite
number of passengers pulls up to rent rooms. countably infinite is the key. Now, the infinite bus
of infinite passengers perplexes the night manager at first, but he realizes there's a way to place each new person. He asks the guest in room 1
to move to room 2. He then asks the guest in room 2 to move to room 4, the guest in room 3 to move to room 6, and so on. Each current guest moves
from room number "n" to room number "2n" -- filling up only the infinite
even-numbered rooms. By doing this, he has now emptied all of the infinitely many
odd-numbered rooms, which are then taken by the people
filing off the infinite bus. Everyone's happy and the hotel's business
is booming more than ever. Well, actually, it is booming
exactly the same amount as ever, banking an infinite number
of dollars a night. Word spreads about this incredible hotel. People pour in from far and wide. One night, the unthinkable happens. The night manager looks outside and sees an infinite line
of infinitely large buses, each with a countably infinite
number of passengers. What can he do? If he cannot find rooms for them,
the hotel will lose out on an infinite amount of money, and he will surely lose his job. Luckily, he remembers
that around the year 300 B.C.E., Euclid proved that there
is an infinite quantity of prime numbers. So, to accomplish this
seemingly impossible task of finding infinite beds
for infinite buses of infinite weary travelers, the night manager assigns
every current guest to the first prime number, 2, raised to the power

symbol I think FY would be quite nice I'm particularly excited about element 117 you might ask why but 17 was the only element in the periodic table when we started this project where nobody had even seen one atom it's never been observed in any form at all so the fields wi wide open and I thought that it would be quite impossible to make a video when we were making videos about each element about an element when nobody's even seen one atom this Arrangement just seems to fall to bits before it can prop form then about 3 years ago our first video wasn't very good there was an exciting result from Russia from dubna where they synthesized the first atoms of element 117 no no it's really exciting because it's it's it's the generation of new matter you know it's almost like a chilas up be spying it's like wow something new something really exciting so those of you who've watched our videos for a long time will know that if you want to synthesize a new element and have your experiments accepted you have to wait till somebody else has repeated the experiments done it a different way and got the same result otherwise anybody could say oh I've seen an atom of elements so and so in fact there has been a case with element 118 where somebody did cheat and the first results were wrong and were faked I explained several times and you may have seen some of the videos how you make these elements you take a sample of a really quite heavy element and the heavier the better and then bombard it with atoms of a lighter element which you accelerate really fast after days perhaps they stick together and you make a big atom in the case of element 117 you choose elements where the atomic numbers when you add them together add up to 117 in this case they used an element 97 brachium and calcium which is element number 20 20 + 97 makes 117 and the atoms of calcium were accelerated in a huge accelerator in Germany at the GSI in damat to a speed that's about a tenth of the speed of light and banged into the sample of beum and created a few atoms now the technical problem is that beum itself is a highly radioactive and unstable element and in a very productive demonstration of international collaboration the bikum was made in America in the Oakridge National Lab and then 13 milligrams that's a tiny bit just almost too small to see just a few grains were transported to Germany in order to do this you can't just have a lamp of buium you have to have one particular isotope a single mass of beum they had beum 249 and this sample was transported to Germany and it's radioactive it has a half life of 330 days so means every 330 days half of it decays away so not only is it radioactive but you have to work quite quickly or your valuable sample is gone before you get round to doing the experiment so they did the experiment the burum was made in the Oakridge National Lab transported to Germany and then it was bombarded with calcium atoms and they looked for the signals for the decay of element 117 and they saw signals corresponding to the sorts of decays that are here on my tie from earlier radioactive elements they've made and the way these elements Decay is that they give off alpha particles these are nuclei of helium atoms and the mass changes in steps of four so the mass goes down by four units and it transforms one element into another and in fact they discovered some quite interesting isotopes of other elements that were formed which had never been observed before during this Decay if pelium is such a pain in the backside and they have to get this tiny sample which decays away why don't they use different elements why don't they use 50 and 67 I think the reason that they use these pretty light atoms is that if they get used bigger and bigger atoms for the Collision there's a likelihood that everything will smash up because the smaller elements are inherently stronger and they don't fragment when they hit the target and so I think if you used um 57 and 60 You' to just end up with a fantastic mess of fragments going everywhere you might make the OD atom of 117 but it would be lost in the noise of everything else so the next stage is that a committee Joint Committee of the international Union of pure and applied chemistry and the corresponding one of physics has to decide whether the evidence is really good enough if everybody is happy then there's the exciting thing they choose the name for the element the the people who get the honor are those that discover the element originally I'm not sure whether this will be counted as the Russians or the Germans but I suspect that everybody will sit down together and there was a huge team working on the latest project I think more than 70 scientists from all sorts of different countries and so now I'm going to put in my bid I think it would be really good to name an element after Richard feineman who was a physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project so he has connections with the oakd lab in where the bilian was made but he's also a huge figure in modern nanotechnology and a founder of much of the research that is being done now so you could have the element f manium with the element symbol I think FY would be quite nice um and that would also serve another purpose because when you see fineman's name written down a lot of people are not sure whether you should pronounce it feeman or fainman but if the element symbol is FY they will all know it has to be pronounced F so my bid for this name is fine manum a group of Russians and Germans aren't going to name it after an American though are they I think it's quite possible that they would because after all the Germans named element 112 after kopernicus who was polish and I think we have got to the stage now where elements are being named after figures or places that have a world role and nationalism is going away and I certainly think that anybody who's read anything about Fineman could imagine that he was a typical citizen of any country he is about the most unconventional scientist that has lived in the last 100 years and also one of the really influential ones as well Professor for the last year or two though I've heard you advocating the name planium we still haven't got planium have you have you abandoned Your Love of the idea of Plum I still like the name Plum but there's some other elements still 115 113 so there's still um opportunities and of course 118 as well but 1177 is an odd number and it's good to name an odd element after an odd scientist I've already got the prize the prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out the kick in a discovery the observation other people use it those are the real things the honors are unreal to me I don't believe in honors

**Transcript**:
Can you read in the car? If so, consider yourself pretty lucky. For one-third of the population, looking at a book
while moving along in a car or a boat or train or plane quickly makes them sick to their stomach. But why do we get motion sickness
in the first place? Well, believe it or not,
scientists aren't exactly sure. The most common theory has to do with mismatched sensory signals. When you travel in a car, your body
gets two different messages. Your eyes are seeing
the inside of a vehicle, which doesn't seem to be moving. Meanwhile, your ear is telling
your brain you're accelerating. Wait, your ear? Your ear has another
important function besides hearing. In its innermost part lies a group of
structures known as the vestibular system, which gives us our sense
of balance and movement. Inside there are
three semicircular tubules that can sense rotation,
one for each dimension of space. And there are also two hair-lined
sacks filled with fluid. When you move, the fluid
shifts and tickles the hairs, telling your brain if you're moving
horizontally or vertically. All this tells your body
which direction you're moving in, how much you've accelerated,
even at what angle. In a car, your vestibular system correctly
senses your movement, but your eyes don't see it,
especially when glued to a book. The opposite can happen. You're at the movies, and the camera
makes a sweeping move. This time, your eyes think you're moving while your ear knows you're sitting still. But why does this conflicting information
make us feel so terrible? Scientists aren't sure, but they think there's
an evolutionary explanation. Fast moving vehicles and video recordings have only existed
in the last couple of centuries, a blink in evolutionary time. For most of our history,
there wasn't that much that could cause this sensory mix-up, except for poisons. And because poisons
are not the best thing for survival, our bodies evolved a direct
but unpleasant way to get rid of what we ate
that was causing the confusion. It's a pretty reasonable theory,
but it leaves things unexplained, like why women are more affected
by motion sickness than men, or why passengers
get more nauseous than drivers. Another theory suggests
that the cause is more about the way some unfamiliar situations make it harder to maintain
our natural body posture. Studies show that being immersed in water
or just changing your stance can greatly reduce the effects
of motion sickness. But we don't really know what's going on. We know the more common remedies
for car queasiness -- looking at the horizon,
over-the-counter pills, chewing gum, but none are totally reliable nor can they handle
intense motion sickness and sometimes the stakes
are far higher than just not being bored during a long car ride. At NASA, where astronauts are hurled
into space at 17,000 miles per hour, motion sickness is a serious problem. In addition to researching
the latest space-age technologies, NASA also spends a lot of time figuring out how to keep astronauts
from vomiting up their space rations. Like understanding the mysteries of sleep
or curing the common cold, motion sickness is one of those
seemingly simple problems that, despite amazing scientific progress,
we still know very little about. Perhaps one day the exact cause
of motion sickness will be found, and with it, a completely
effective way to prevent it, but that day is still on the horizon.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Can you read in the car? If so, consider yourself pretty lucky. For one-third of the population, looking at a book
while moving along in a car or a boat or train or plane quickly makes them sick to their stomach. But why do we get motion sickness
in the first place? Well, believe it or not,
scientists aren't exactly sure. The most common theory has to do with mismatched sensory signals. When you travel in a car, your body
gets two different messages. Your eyes are seeing
the inside of a vehicle, which doesn't seem to be moving. Meanwhile, your ear is telling
your brain you're accelerating. Wait, your ear? Your ear has another
important function besides hearing. In its innermost part lies a group of
structures known as the vestibular system, which gives us our sense
of balance and movement. Inside there are
three semicircular tubules that can sense rotation,
one for each dimension of space. And there are also two hair-lined
sacks filled with fluid. When you move, the fluid
shifts and tickles the hairs, telling your brain if you're moving
horizontally or vertically. All this tells your body
which direction you're moving in, how much you've accelerated,
even at what angle. In a car, your vestibular system correctly
senses your movement, but your eyes don't see it,
especially when glued to a book. The opposite can happen. You're at the movies, and the camera
makes a sweeping move. This time, your eyes think you're moving while your ear knows you're sitting still. But why does this conflicting information
make us feel so terrible? Scientists aren't sure, but they think there's
an evolutionary explanation. Fast moving vehicles and video recordings have only existed
in the last couple of centuries, a blink in evolutionary time. For most of our history,
there wasn't that much that could cause this sensory mix-up, except for poisons. And because poisons
are not the best thing for survival, our bodies evolved a direct
but unpleasant way to get rid of what we ate
that was causing the confusion. It's a pretty reasonable theory,
but it leaves things unexplained, like why women are more affected
by motion sickness than men, or why passengers
get more nauseous than drivers. Another theory suggests
that the cause is more about the way some unfamiliar situations make it harder to maintain
our natural body posture. Studies show that being immersed in water
or just changing your stance can greatly reduce the effects
of motion sickness. But we don't really know what's going on. We know the more common remedies
for car queasiness -- looking at the horizon,
over-the-counter pills, chewing gum, but none are totally reliable nor can they handle
intense motion sickness and sometimes the stakes
are far higher than just not being bored during a long car ride. At NASA, where astronauts are hurled
into space at 17,000 miles per hour, motion sickness is a serious problem. In addition to researching
the latest space-age technologies, NASA also spends a lot of time figuring out how to keep astronauts
from vomiting up their space rations. Like understanding the mysteries of sleep
or curing the common cold, motion sickness is one of those
seemingly simple problems that, despite amazing scientific progress,
we still know very little about. Perhaps one day the exact cause
of motion sickness will be found, and with it, a completely
effective way to prevent it, but that day is still on the horizon.

Evaluation Prompt:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Element 118, Ununoctium or Uuo, is the last element in the Periodic Table, and it's in the group which contains the noble gases, going from Helium right down to radioactive Radon, so it is going to be radioactive. So far, only 3 Atoms, have been observed. First one Atom then another two. So it's more than Ununquadium, is it more? It's more than Ununquadium, where we had, only one Atom, but  it's still not very many Atoms. It's still arguable whether it will be a gass-like Radon, or it may be a solid, just like some of the other elements, perhaps a solid that's rather volatile. So that it would evaporate easily. But nobody knows. How can you know 118  is the last element, on the Periodic Table? -Well formally, they could be heavier elements than 118, but the electrons, the negatively charged particles, that surround, the positively charged nucleus, are in shells, which gradually go outwards. Rather like the skins, of an onion. So that element 118, represents the whole of a shell, being filled. So we know that there are no more electrons, that can be easily accommodated and if we make element 119, which would be an alkali metal like sodium or cesium, then we would have to put a single electron, a lot further away, from the nucleus. And as soon as you start adding electrons, that are further away, the whole system, is expected to become very much less stable. So if we can only make  3 Atoms of element 118, something that's going to be very much less stable, is not likely to be found in the short time. Though one of the  exciting things about science, is that the unexpected often happens. So, it might be that before  we've started updating, some of these videos, element 119 will be announced. And nobody will be more excited than me. www.periodicvideos.com University of Nottingham Captions by www.SubPLY.com
