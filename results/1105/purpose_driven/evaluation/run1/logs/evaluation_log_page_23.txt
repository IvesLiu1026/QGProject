You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In 1987, tens of thousands of people gathered in Saudi Arabia 
for the annual Hajj pilgrimage. But what started out as a celebration 
led to a health crisis: just a few days after the pilgrimage, more than 2,000 cases 
of meningitis broke out spreading across Saudi Arabia
and the rest of the world. The outbreak was so fierce that it was believed to have sparked a
wave of deadly meningitis epidemics that ultimately infected tens of
thousands of people worldwide. Meningitis is the inflammation 
of the meninges, three tissue layers responsible for 
protecting the brain and spinal cord. What makes meningitis so dangerous
compared to other diseases is the sheer speed with which
it invades a person’s body. In the worst cases, it causes death 
within a day. Fortunately, that’s rare for patients
who receive early medical treatment. The disease primarily 
comes in three forms: fungal, viral, and bacterial--
the last being the most deadly by far, and what we’ll focus on. People usually contract bacterial 
meningitis by breathing in tiny particles of mucus and 
saliva that spray into the air when an infected person 
sneezes or coughs. It can also be transmitted 
through kissing, or sharing cigarettes, 
toothbrushes or utensils. Some people can be infected 
and carry the disease without showing symptoms
or getting sick, which helps the disease
spread quickly to others. Once the bacteria enter 
the nose, mouth, and throat, they cross the surrounding 
membranes and enter the bloodstream. From there, bacteria have 
rapid access to the body’s tissues --including a membrane
called the blood-brain barrier. This is made of a tight mesh of cells which
separate blood vessels from the brain, and block everything except
for a specific set of particles, including water molecules and some gases. But in ways that scientists are 
still trying to understand, meningitis bacteria can trick
the barrier into letting them through. Inside the brain, the bacteria swiftly
infect the meninges. This triggers inflammation as the body’s 
immune response kicks into overdrive, bringing on fever
and intense headaches. As swelling in the meninges worsens,
the neck begins to stiffen. Swelling in the brain disrupts its
normal function-- causing symptoms like hearing loss 
and extreme light sensitivity. As pressure increases in the cranium, 
it may also make the person confused-- one of the hallmarks
of the disease. A few hours in, the rapidly multiplying
bacteria start to release toxins, leading to septicemia,
also known as blood poisoning. This breaks down blood vessels, letting blood seep out and form what
starts out looking like a rash, and evolves into big discoloured blots 
beneath the skin. At the same time, these toxins
burn through oxygen in the blood, reducing the amount that gets to 
major organs like the lungs and kidneys. That increases the chance 
of organ shut down --and alongside spreading 
septicemia, threatens death. That all sounds scary, but doctors are so
good at treating meningitis that a visit to the hospital can drastically
reduce an adult’s risk of dying from it. The longer it’s left 
untreated, though, the more likely it will lead
to lasting damage. If declining oxygen levels cause cell
death in extreme parts of the body --like fingers, toes, arms and legs--
the risk of amputation goes up. And if bacterial toxins accumulate
in the brain and trigger cell death, meningitis could also cause long-term
brain damage and memory loss. So fast treatment, or better yet, 
prevention, is critical. That's why most countries have
vaccines that defend against the disease in its deadliest forms. Those are usually given to the people who
are most at risk--like young children, people with weak immune systems, 
or people who gather in large groups where an outbreak of meningitis 
could potentially happen. In addition to those gatherings, meningitis is most common in
a region called the meningitis belt that stretches across Africa, though cases
do happen all over the world. If you’re concerned that you or someone 
you know may have meningitis, get to the doctor as soon as possible; quick action could save your life.

through kissing, or sharing cigarettes, 
toothbrushes or utensils. Some people can be infected 
and carry the disease without showing symptoms
or getting sick, which helps the disease
spread quickly to others. Once the bacteria enter 
the nose, mouth, and throat, they cross the surrounding 
membranes and enter the bloodstream. From there, bacteria have 
rapid access to the body’s tissues --including a membrane
called the blood-brain barrier. This is made of a tight mesh of cells which
separate blood vessels from the brain, and block everything except
for a specific set of particles, including water molecules and some gases. But in ways that scientists are 
still trying to understand, meningitis bacteria can trick
the barrier into letting them through. Inside the brain, the bacteria swiftly
infect the meninges. This triggers inflammation as the body’s 
immune response kicks into overdrive, bringing on fever
and intense headaches. As swelling in the meninges worsens,
the neck begins to stiffen. Swelling in the brain disrupts its
normal function-- causing symptoms like hearing loss 
and extreme light sensitivity. As pressure increases in the cranium, 
it may also make the person confused-- one of the hallmarks
of the disease. A few hours in, the rapidly multiplying
bacteria start to release toxins, leading to septicemia,
also known as blood poisoning. This breaks down blood vessels, letting blood seep out and form what
starts out looking like a rash, and evolves into big discoloured blots 
beneath the skin. At the same time, these toxins
burn through oxygen in the blood, reducing the amount that gets to 
major organs like the lungs and kidneys. That increases the chance 
of organ shut down --and alongside spreading 
septicemia, threatens death. That all sounds scary, but doctors are so
good at treating meningitis that a visit to the hospital can drastically
reduce an adult’s risk of dying from it. The longer it’s left 
untreated, though, the more likely it will lead
to lasting damage. If declining oxygen levels cause cell
death in extreme parts of the body --like fingers, toes, arms and legs--
the risk of amputation goes up. And if bacterial toxins accumulate
in the brain and trigger cell death, meningitis could also cause long-term
brain damage and memory loss. So fast treatment, or better yet, 
prevention, is critical. That's why most countries have
vaccines that defend against the disease in its deadliest forms. Those are usually given to the people who
are most at risk--like young children, people with weak immune systems, 
or people who gather in large groups where an outbreak of meningitis 
could potentially happen. In addition to those gatherings, meningitis is most common in
a region called the meningitis belt that stretches across Africa, though cases
do happen all over the world. If you’re concerned that you or someone 
you know may have meningitis, get to the doctor as soon as possible; quick action could save your life.

In 1987, tens of thousands of people gathered in Saudi Arabia 
for the annual Hajj pilgrimage. But what started out as a celebration 
led to a health crisis: just a few days after the pilgrimage, more than 2,000 cases 
of meningitis broke out spreading across Saudi Arabia
and the rest of the world. The outbreak was so fierce that it was believed to have sparked a
wave of deadly meningitis epidemics that ultimately infected tens of
thousands of people worldwide. Meningitis is the inflammation 
of the meninges, three tissue layers responsible for 
protecting the brain and spinal cord. What makes meningitis so dangerous
compared to other diseases is the sheer speed with which
it invades a person’s body. In the worst cases, it causes death 
within a day. Fortunately, that’s rare for patients
who receive early medical treatment. The disease primarily 
comes in three forms: fungal, viral, and bacterial--
the last being the most deadly by far, and what we’ll focus on. People usually contract bacterial 
meningitis by breathing in tiny particles of mucus and 
saliva that spray into the air when an infected person 
sneezes or coughs. It can also be transmitted 
through kissing, or sharing cigarettes, 
toothbrushes or utensils. Some people can be infected 
and carry the disease without showing symptoms
or getting sick, which helps the disease
spread quickly to others. Once the bacteria enter 
the nose, mouth, and throat, they cross the surrounding 
membranes and enter the bloodstream. From there, bacteria have 
rapid access to the body’s tissues --including a membrane

[♪ INTRO] The human body is an incredibly complex machine
made up of systems of organs all working together to keep things humming along smoothly. So you’d think that taking anything out
would make the whole thing break down. But of course, lots of people live without
some of their organs. Like, you’re better off without an appendix
if it’s giving you a problem, for example. And you can afford to lose all kinds of more
important organs, too, like a giant chunk of your liver or even an entire lung. Because yeah, your body is a finely tuned
machine — if you don’t mind me saying so — but it also has a bunch of redundancies
that allow it to adapt to some pretty extreme changes. So here are just a few of the bits you can
live without. Number one, the brain. You didn’t think we were gonna go there! Of all of the organs in the human body to
lose, even partially, you would think that the brain would be a total dealbreaker. I mean, it controls or coordinates basically
everything else. But it turns out that sometimes, it’s better
to live with just one hemisphere — half a brain, in other words. Like when people have a kind of epilepsy where
seizures stem from one side of the brain. This can happen with some developmental brain
disorders, or with rare conditions like when one brain hemisphere is abnormally large. One-sided seizures are often difficult to
treat, and they can be debilitating. So sometimes doctors recommend a hemispherectomy:
the removal of some or all of the half of the brain that’s affected. It’s a very rare, extreme operation, obviously,
but when it’s successful, it can result in a relatively normal life. After a hemispherectomy, between 50-90% of
patients become completely seizure free. They do experience some paralysis in the half
of the body normally controlled by the missing brain hemisphere, but most are still able
to walk if they could before the procedure. And the surgery doesn’t usually result in
cognitive deficits, either. Younger patients tend to have fewer side effects
because the remaining healthy hemisphere is still developing, allowing it to compensate
for what’s missing. Still, it’s a difficult procedure with major
risks, so doctors don’t just chop out half of somebody’s brain without carefully weighing
other options. But the idea that you can lose half of your
brain and still be alive at all is pretty incredible. You might even say it’s … mind-blowing. Breathing is another thing that’s kind of
essential for human life, so you would think that losing a lung would cause a lot of problems. But you can get by just fine with just one
lung. Lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, cancer, or tuberculosis can wreck someone’s lung tissues. So in some cases, part of a lung or even the
entire lung will be removed in a surgery called a pneumonectomy. When one lung is removed, the extra space
allows other organs to shift a bit, giving the remaining lung some more room to expand. Studies have shown that in some animals like
dogs and rats, the remaining lung can actually grow new alveoli—the little sacs where gas
exchange happens. It’s thought that children who get a pneumonectomy
might also do this since their lungs are still developing. But in adults, it’s more likely that the
alveoli just stretch and expand a little to move more air through. Ultimately, one lung is able to do about 70-80%
of what two lungs can, and that is usually enough. Depending on age and other health factors,
it might be a bit more difficult to do strenuous activities, but some people who have had this
surgery go on to run marathons, which is more than I can say for me. Your stomach has to be tough enough to mush
around your meals in gastric acid before passing them along to the small intestine. So it’s fairly resilient. But it can still become impaired or diseased
to the point that the patient needs surgery to redirect the digestive tract around their
stomach or to remove part of it. And in some cases, surgeons perform a total
gastrectomy to take out the whole thing and just connect the esophagus directly to
the small intestine. Oddly enough, this doesn’t really affect
the overall process of digestion since most of it occurs in the small intestine anyway. But since there is no stomach to store food
in, patients often need to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Sometimes they also need additional vitamin
supplements for things that aren’t absorbed well by the small intestine, like vitamin
B12 or vitamin D. And some patients might develop a side effect
called dumping syndrome, which, no, does not refer to the ‘dumping’ that you may be
thinking of right now. Sugars and starches are usually digested in
the stomach, but after a gastrectomy, they “dump” straight into the small intestine. Since the intestine isn’t used to that,
it recruits water to help break those things down, and a lot of that water comes from your
blood, causing a drop in blood pressure. With dumping syndrome, that can cause all
kinds of unpleasant symptoms after a meal: cramping and bloating, nausea, weakness, dizziness,
and low blood pressure. But generally, dietary changes are enough
to overcome these issues, and people without a stomach get enough calories to go back to
their lives. The spleen, which sits to the left of the
stomach, is also a pretty useful organ. It’s involved in filtering blood, including
removing and breaking down old red blood cells, and it’s one of the places where infection-fighting
white blood cells are produced. But when bad things happen to someone’s
abdomen—like if they get shot or stabbed or get in a motorcycle accident like my father-in-law,
the spleen can rupture. That’s super dangerous because it can result
in internal bleeding that could be fatal. The spleen can also cause problems if it becomes
enlarged from an infection, because the swelling can trap and destroy healthy blood cells,
leading to anemia. In those cases, doctors will do a splenectomy,
where they remove part or all of the spleen. It’s typically considered a safe procedure,
but because of its role in the immune system, people without a spleen are more prone to
infections, especially from certain bacteria. So for people without spleens, it’s important
for them to boost their immune system by taking preventative antibiotics and staying vaccinated. But the redundancy of the human body means
the immune system isn’t completely destroyed. And the liver can pick up the slack when it
comes to filtering blood. Speaking of which… Your liver does a lot—it processes nutrients,
detoxifies your blood, and produces bile, a fluid that helps digestion. And yet, while you can’t have your whole
liver removed, you can donate more than half of it to help someone whose liver is diseased. What’s really amazing, though, is that unlike
your other organs, your liver will grow back. Your liver is made of hepatocytes, specialized
cells that don’t actively replicate…that is, until some are missing. When a piece of liver is removed, hepatocytes
reactivate and start replicating again, growing new liver cells. Liver regeneration is so efficient that you
can lose up to 65% of your liver and it’ll grow back within a year. Just a quarter of a liver can become a completely
new liver in a transplant recipient. Like any major surgery, there are risks and
potential complications. But if you’re in good health and feeling
altruistic, liver donation is a thing that you can do and probably be totally fine afterwards. Tucked underneath your liver is a small, pear-shaped
organ: the gallbladder. Its main job is to store the bile that the
liver produces until it’s needed for digestion. But sometimes, the components of bile harden
into small pebble-like stones, and if those stones become a problem, doctors just yank
out the whole thing. Bile is mostly made up of cholesterol, bile
salts, and a waste compound called bilirubin that’s responsible for the color of your
poop. In the small intestine, bile’s job is to
help digest fats and break down fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A and vitamin D. But for reasons that actually aren’t well-understood,
the cholesterol and bilirubin in bile can harden into gallstones, which can cause blockages
in the bile duct, the tube that leads to the small intestine. Problematic gallstones are super painful,
and without treatment, they can lead to infections and inflammation and even be deadly. Unlike kidney stones, which can often be peed
out, gallstones don’t exit willingly. Sometimes they can be dissolved with medication,
but usually they return after the meds are stopped. So in most cases, the treatment for gallstones
is to remove the gallbladder entirely by performing a cholecystectomy. This surgery was first performed in 1882. A German surgeon noted that other mammals
don’t have a gallbladder, so he figured ours probably wasn’t too important. And he was kind of right. The bile still gets to your small intestine
without it — it just doesn’t get temporarily stored along the way. If your gallbladder is removed and the surgery
goes smoothly, usually all you have to show for it is a tiny scar and maybe a little bit
of extra indigestion. Each of your kidneys is made up of more than
a million filtering units called nephrons, which remove waste and excess fluid from the
blood. If that doesn’t seem too important to you,
just imagine what would happen to your house if you couldn’t take out the trash for a
couple months. In your body, increased levels of waste can
cause vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration... The whole body can swell, increasing blood
pressure and imparing breathing. And chemical imbalances from improper fluid
management can lead to serious issues like bone and muscle loss. Ultimately, kidney failure can be fatal. Yet, you only really need one of your kidneys. Each day, a pair of kidneys filters about
150 liters of blood to produce about a liter and a half of urine. But even one healthy kidney can do all that
work on its own, which is why live kidney donation is a thing. When one kidney is removed, the other kidney’s
nephrons compensate by getting bigger so they can each do more filtering. It becomes just as effective as two kidneys
would be. And weirdly, leaving a bad kidney or even
two inside of you isn’t a problem, either. Recipients don’t always get their faulty
kidneys removed, so they actually end up living with a total of three kidneys, even though
only one is doing all of the work. Obviously, your body works best and is the
healthiest when all of the parts are present and functioning. But it is definitely possible to live a healthy
and relatively normal life without some organs, because the human body is incredibly good
at adapting to change. Remove an organ or two, and it just takes
it in stride, it’s like, “I’m gonna be one big lung now, I’m fine!” I mean, it doesn’t look that impressive,
I don’t think, but it is pretty wonderful, thank you body! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow. If you liked hearing about your various removable
body parts, you might also enjoy this episode on how some people have bits replaced with
animal parts. [♪ OUTRO]

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 7: What is the name of the surgery that involves removing part or all of the gallbladder? Options: A. Cholecystectomy, B. Gastrectomy, C. Splenectomy, D. Hemispherectomy Correct Option: A**

However, the options in this question do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the surgery to remove one of the lungs and has options that include Pneumonectomy.

A more suitable match would be:

**Question 1 is not a good match, Question 2 is not a good match, Question 3 is not a good match, Question 4 is not a good match, Question 5 is not a good match, Question 6 is not a good match, Question 7 is not a good match, Question 8 is not a good match, Question 9 is not a good match, Question 10 is not a good match**

Actually, none of the questions are a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ. However, if we were to choose one that is the most similar in terms of the type of question being asked, it would be:

**Question 2: What is the name of the surgery that involves removing part or all of the spleen? Options: A. Hemispherectomy, B. Pneumonectomy, C. Gastrectomy, D. Splenectomy Correct Option: D**

This question is similar in that it asks for the name of a surgery that involves removing an organ. However, the organ in question is the spleen, not the lung.

If we really had to choose one, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be:

**2**

However, please note that this is not a perfect match, and a new question that is more similar to the ground truth MCQ should be generated.

After re-reading the generated MCQs, I noticed that I missed one important detail in question 2. One of the options in question 2 is actually B. Pneumonectomy, which is the correct answer for the ground truth MCQ.

So, the correct index of the most similar generated MCQ is indeed **2**, but not because the question is similar, but because one of the options matches the correct answer of the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must emphasize that the question itself is not similar to the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that is more similar should be generated.

In this case, I would recommend generating a new question that is more similar to the ground truth MCQ, such as:

**What is the name of the surgery that involves removing one of the lungs? Options: A. Splenectomy, B. Cholecystectomy, C. Pneumonectomy**

This new question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of the type of question being asked and the options provided.

of the body normally controlled by the missing brain hemisphere, but most are still able
to walk if they could before the procedure. And the surgery doesn’t usually result in
cognitive deficits, either. Younger patients tend to have fewer side effects
because the remaining healthy hemisphere is still developing, allowing it to compensate
for what’s missing. Still, it’s a difficult procedure with major
risks, so doctors don’t just chop out half of somebody’s brain without carefully weighing
other options. But the idea that you can lose half of your
brain and still be alive at all is pretty incredible. You might even say it’s … mind-blowing. Breathing is another thing that’s kind of
essential for human life, so you would think that losing a lung would cause a lot of problems. But you can get by just fine with just one
lung. Lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, cancer, or tuberculosis can wreck someone’s lung tissues. So in some cases, part of a lung or even the
entire lung will be removed in a surgery called a pneumonectomy. When one lung is removed, the extra space
allows other organs to shift a bit, giving the remaining lung some more room to expand. Studies have shown that in some animals like
dogs and rats, the remaining lung can actually grow new alveoli—the little sacs where gas
exchange happens. It’s thought that children who get a pneumonectomy
might also do this since their lungs are still developing. But in adults, it’s more likely that the
alveoli just stretch and expand a little to move more air through. Ultimately, one lung is able to do about 70-80%
of what two lungs can, and that is usually enough. Depending on age and other health factors,
it might be a bit more difficult to do strenuous activities, but some people who have had this
surgery go on to run marathons, which is more than I can say for me. Your stomach has to be tough enough to mush
around your meals in gastric acid before passing them along to the small intestine. So it’s fairly resilient. But it can still become impaired or diseased
to the point that the patient needs surgery to redirect the digestive tract around their
stomach or to remove part of it. And in some cases, surgeons perform a total
gastrectomy to take out the whole thing and just connect the esophagus directly to
the small intestine. Oddly enough, this doesn’t really affect
the overall process of digestion since most of it occurs in the small intestine anyway. But since there is no stomach to store food
in, patients often need to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Sometimes they also need additional vitamin
supplements for things that aren’t absorbed well by the small intestine, like vitamin
B12 or vitamin D. And some patients might develop a side effect
called dumping syndrome, which, no, does not refer to the ‘dumping’ that you may be
thinking of right now. Sugars and starches are usually digested in
the stomach, but after a gastrectomy, they “dump” straight into the small intestine. Since the intestine isn’t used to that,
it recruits water to help break those things down, and a lot of that water comes from your
blood, causing a drop in blood pressure. With dumping syndrome, that can cause all
kinds of unpleasant symptoms after a meal: cramping and bloating, nausea, weakness, dizziness,
and low blood pressure. But generally, dietary changes are enough
to overcome these issues, and people without a stomach get enough calories to go back to
their lives. The spleen, which sits to the left of the
stomach, is also a pretty useful organ. It’s involved in filtering blood, including
removing and breaking down old red blood cells, and it’s one of the places where infection-fighting
white blood cells are produced. But when bad things happen to someone’s
abdomen—like if they get shot or stabbed or get in a motorcycle accident like my father-in-law,
the spleen can rupture. That’s super dangerous because it can result
in internal bleeding that could be fatal. The spleen can also cause problems if it becomes
enlarged from an infection, because the swelling can trap and destroy healthy blood cells,
leading to anemia. In those cases, doctors will do a splenectomy,
where they remove part or all of the spleen. It’s typically considered a safe procedure,
but because of its role in the immune system, people without a spleen are more prone to
infections, especially from certain bacteria. So for people without spleens, it’s important
for them to boost their immune system by taking preventative antibiotics and staying vaccinated. But the redundancy of the human body means
the immune system isn’t completely destroyed. And the liver can pick up the slack when it
comes to filtering blood. Speaking of which… Your liver does a lot—it processes nutrients,
detoxifies your blood, and produces bile, a fluid that helps digestion. And yet, while you can’t have your whole
liver removed, you can donate more than half of it to help someone whose liver is diseased. What’s really amazing, though, is that unlike
your other organs, your liver will grow back. Your liver is made of hepatocytes, specialized
cells that don’t actively replicate…that is, until some are missing. When a piece of liver is removed, hepatocytes
reactivate and start replicating again, growing new liver cells. Liver regeneration is so efficient that you
can lose up to 65% of your liver and it’ll grow back within a year. Just a quarter of a liver can become a completely
new liver in a transplant recipient. Like any major surgery, there are risks and
potential complications. But if you’re in good health and feeling
altruistic, liver donation is a thing that you can do and probably be totally fine afterwards. Tucked underneath your liver is a small, pear-shaped
organ: the gallbladder. Its main job is to store the bile that the
liver produces until it’s needed for digestion. But sometimes, the components of bile harden
into small pebble-like stones, and if those stones become a problem, doctors just yank
out the whole thing. Bile is mostly made up of cholesterol, bile
salts, and a waste compound called bilirubin that’s responsible for the color of your
poop. In the small intestine, bile’s job is to
help digest fats and break down fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A and vitamin D. But for reasons that actually aren’t well-understood,
the cholesterol and bilirubin in bile can harden into gallstones, which can cause blockages
in the bile duct, the tube that leads to the small intestine. Problematic gallstones are super painful,
and without treatment, they can lead to infections and inflammation and even be deadly. Unlike kidney stones, which can often be peed
out, gallstones don’t exit willingly. Sometimes they can be dissolved with medication,
but usually they return after the meds are stopped. So in most cases, the treatment for gallstones
is to remove the gallbladder entirely by performing a cholecystectomy. This surgery was first performed in 1882. A German surgeon noted that other mammals
don’t have a gallbladder, so he figured ours probably wasn’t too important. And he was kind of right. The bile still gets to your small intestine
without it — it just doesn’t get temporarily stored along the way. If your gallbladder is removed and the surgery
goes smoothly, usually all you have to show for it is a tiny scar and maybe a little bit
of extra indigestion. Each of your kidneys is made up of more than
a million filtering units called nephrons, which remove waste and excess fluid from the
blood. If that doesn’t seem too important to you,
just imagine what would happen to your house if you couldn’t take out the trash for a
couple months. In your body, increased levels of waste can
cause vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration... The whole body can swell, increasing blood
pressure and imparing breathing. And chemical imbalances from improper fluid
management can lead to serious issues like bone and muscle loss. Ultimately, kidney failure can be fatal. Yet, you only really need one of your kidneys. Each day, a pair of kidneys filters about
150 liters of blood to produce about a liter and a half of urine. But even one healthy kidney can do all that
work on its own, which is why live kidney donation is a thing. When one kidney is removed, the other kidney’s
nephrons compensate by getting bigger so they can each do more filtering. It becomes just as effective as two kidneys
would be. And weirdly, leaving a bad kidney or even
two inside of you isn’t a problem, either. Recipients don’t always get their faulty
kidneys removed, so they actually end up living with a total of three kidneys, even though
only one is doing all of the work. Obviously, your body works best and is the
healthiest when all of the parts are present and functioning. But it is definitely possible to live a healthy
and relatively normal life without some organs, because the human body is incredibly good
at adapting to change. Remove an organ or two, and it just takes
it in stride, it’s like, “I’m gonna be one big lung now, I’m fine!” I mean, it doesn’t look that impressive,
I don’t think, but it is pretty wonderful, thank you body! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow. If you liked hearing about your various removable
body parts, you might also enjoy this episode on how some people have bits replaced with

**Transcript**:
This ad isn’t what you think. It’s not promoting a sports team or a grill
company. It’s for an apple. And unlike those that have dominated the produce
section when you were a kid, new breeds like this one have catchy names, logos, and slogans. And are trying to generate buzz before you
can buy them. Historically, our produce has gone unbranded. So how did we end up with all these apples? For most of the past century, America’s
iconic apple was that of Snow White. Lipstick red, with shiny skin and a crisp
white interior, a.k.a. “the Red Delicious.” First grown on an orchard in Iowa and originally
named after its founder, when it came out in the late 1800s, it was dubbed “the best
apple of any time” Growers and retail stores loved the Red delicious
because it looked good. It was uniform in size and color, turned red
before it was ripe, and wouldn’t bruise easily. And Americans loved the taste. By the 1980s, close to half of all apples
grown in the US were Red Delicious. The trouble is, when you bite into one now,
it often doesn’t taste great. People complain of mushy flesh and tough skin.
Its defining characteristic can sometimes be that it has no flavor at all. It takes years and a lot of money to develop
a good tasting apple, but growers were incentivized to cut costs -- at the expense of taste. That is, until one apple proved them all wrong. The Honeycrisp. The honeycrisp is everything that the Red
Delicious was not. When it came out in market in 1991, after
30 years of development, it had a refreshing taste, a delicate skin, and a soft, juicy
crunch. And even though it can cost more than two
times the average price of apples, consumers then and now are willing to pay a premium
price, so much so that it’s now the fifth most produced apple in the US. So the honeycrisp started a sort of revolution
in the apple industry: Now that people knew expensive, flavor-focused apples would sell,
breeders experimented to create tastier, more inventive varieties. And they sought to protect their apples’
good names, by patenting their trees and trademarking
their brand names. This process picked up speed after a 1980
federal law allowed universities to own and patent their inventions, including apple trees. And research programs for apple breeding took
advantage of the new rules. In order to plant these new patented varieties,
growers had to pay up: usually about $1 per patented tree and a portion of sales for use
of a trademarked name. Plus, each trademarked apple had to pass muster
on firmness, sugar content, blemishes and color. These quality checks mean that even though
the trademarked Pink Lady and the generic Cripps Pink originate from the same type of
tree, they look and taste different — the Pink Lady is held to rigorous trademark standards
and that is what, the company says, justifies their higher price. Now, not all new apples get trademarked. It is only those that experts believe can
garner a premium price. And it can take up to 10 years after securing
a patent and trademark to plant and grow enough trees for commercial production. So while they waited on the fruits of their
labor, growers worked on marketing their apple in the hopes finding loyal consumers in a
competitive market. And they’re not alone. Visit your grocery store and you will see
a lot more name brands in the produce section. Branded fruits and vegetables are a growing
trend. While not all branded apples will see success
on par with the honeycrisp, there is one that has high hopes. Washington State growers are ramping up production
of their Cosmic Crisp, an apple that’s both sweet and tart, firm and crisp, and much easier
to grow than the honeycrisp. They’re trying to get people excited about
tasting something new and that’s not a bad thing. While we could see higher prices in the future,
the fruits and veggies themselves will be objectively better. And consumers will have more options, just
like we do with our phones, or our computers, or our cereal. And now, our apples.

**Transcript**:
This ad isn’t what you think. It’s not promoting a sports team or a grill
company. It’s for an apple. And unlike those that have dominated the produce
section when you were a kid, new breeds like this one have catchy names, logos, and slogans. And are trying to generate buzz before you
can buy them. Historically, our produce has gone unbranded. So how did we end up with all these apples? For most of the past century, America’s
iconic apple was that of Snow White. Lipstick red, with shiny skin and a crisp
white interior, a.k.a. “the Red Delicious.” First grown on an orchard in Iowa and originally
named after its founder, when it came out in the late 1800s, it was dubbed “the best
apple of any time” Growers and retail stores loved the Red delicious
because it looked good. It was uniform in size and color, turned red
before it was ripe, and wouldn’t bruise easily. And Americans loved the taste. By the 1980s, close to half of all apples
grown in the US were Red Delicious. The trouble is, when you bite into one now,
it often doesn’t taste great. People complain of mushy flesh and tough skin.
Its defining characteristic can sometimes be that it has no flavor at all. It takes years and a lot of money to develop
a good tasting apple, but growers were incentivized to cut costs -- at the expense of taste. That is, until one apple proved them all wrong. The Honeycrisp. The honeycrisp is everything that the Red
Delicious was not. When it came out in market in 1991, after
30 years of development, it had a refreshing taste, a delicate skin, and a soft, juicy
crunch. And even though it can cost more than two
times the average price of apples, consumers then and now are willing to pay a premium
price, so much so that it’s now the fifth most produced apple in the US. So the honeycrisp started a sort of revolution
in the apple industry: Now that people knew expensive, flavor-focused apples would sell,
breeders experimented to create tastier, more inventive varieties. And they sought to protect their apples’
good names, by patenting their trees and trademarking
their brand names. This process picked up speed after a 1980
federal law allowed universities to own and patent their inventions, including apple trees. And research programs for apple breeding took
advantage of the new rules. In order to plant these new patented varieties,
growers had to pay up: usually about $1 per patented tree and a portion of sales for use
of a trademarked name. Plus, each trademarked apple had to pass muster
on firmness, sugar content, blemishes and color. These quality checks mean that even though
the trademarked Pink Lady and the generic Cripps Pink originate from the same type of
tree, they look and taste different — the Pink Lady is held to rigorous trademark standards
and that is what, the company says, justifies their higher price. Now, not all new apples get trademarked. It is only those that experts believe can
garner a premium price. And it can take up to 10 years after securing
a patent and trademark to plant and grow enough trees for commercial production. So while they waited on the fruits of their
labor, growers worked on marketing their apple in the hopes finding loyal consumers in a
competitive market. And they’re not alone. Visit your grocery store and you will see
a lot more name brands in the produce section. Branded fruits and vegetables are a growing
trend. While not all branded apples will see success
on par with the honeycrisp, there is one that has high hopes. Washington State growers are ramping up production
of their Cosmic Crisp, an apple that’s both sweet and tart, firm and crisp, and much easier
to grow than the honeycrisp. They’re trying to get people excited about
tasting something new and that’s not a bad thing. While we could see higher prices in the future,
the fruits and veggies themselves will be objectively better. And consumers will have more options, just
like we do with our phones, or our computers, or our cereal. And now, our apples.

**Transcript**:
You’re on the trail of a werewolf that’s been terrorizing your town. After months of detective work, you’ve narrowed your suspects to 
one of five people: the mayor, the tailor, the baker, the grocer, or the carpenter. You’ve invited them to dinner 
with a simple plan: you’ll slip a square of 
a rare werewolf antidote into each of their dinners. Unfortunately, your pet goat
just ate four of the squares, and you only have one left. Luckily, the remaining square is 50 grams, and the minimum effective dose 
is 10 grams. If you can precisely divide the 
square into fifths you’ll have just enough 
antidote for everyone. You’ll have to use a laser-cutting tool
to cut up the square; every other means available to you
isn’t precise enough. There are 8 points that can act 
as starting or ending points for each cut. To use the device, you’ll
have to input pairs of points that tell the laser where to begin 
and end each cut, and then the laser executes
all the cuts simultaneously. It’s okay to cut the square 
into as many pieces as you want, as long as you can group them
into 10 gram portions. But you can’t fold the square 
or alter it otherwise, and you only get one shot 
at using the laser cutter. The full moon is rising,  and in a moment someone
will transform and tear you all apart unless you can cure them first. How can you divide the antidote 
into perfect fifths, cure the secret werewolf, 
and save everyone? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 When it comes to puzzles that
involve cutting and rearranging, it’s often helpful to actually 
take a piece of paper and try cutting it up to see what
you can get. If we cut BF and DH we’d get fourths,
but we need fifths. Maybe there’s a way to shave a bit off
of a quarter to get exactly one fifth. Cutting BE looks good at first, 
but that last cut takes a off a quarter of a quarter, leaving us with a portion of 3/16: 
just smaller than a fifth, and not enough to cure a werewolf. What if we started with BE instead? That would also give us a quarter. And is there a way to shave
just a bit more off? Both DG and CH look promising. If we make one more cut, from A to F, we may start to notice something. With these four cuts—from B to E, 
D to G, F to A, and H to C—we’ve got four triangles and a square in the middle. But the pieces that make 
each triangle can also be rearranged to make a square
identical to the middle one. This means that we’ve split
the antidote into perfect fifths! What’s interesting about this 
sort of problem is that while it’s possible to solve 
it by starting from the geometry, it’s actually easier to start 
experimenting and see where that gets you. That wouldn’t be as viable if the square 
had, say, 24 cut points, but with just 8 there
are only so many reasonable options. You secretly dose each of the townspeople as the full moon emerges in the sky. And just as you do, 
a terrible transformation begins. Then, just as suddenly, it reverses. Your measurements were perfect,  and the people and animals of the 
town can rest a little easier.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the identity of the secret werewolf, while the generated MCQs focus on the problem-solving process, the antidote, and the laser cutter. However, Question 5: "How many people are you trying to cure with the antidote?" is the closest in terms of context, as it mentions the people involved in the scenario, which includes the secret werewolf.

Therefore, I would suggest Question 5 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it's not a direct match.

into 10 gram portions. But you can’t fold the square 
or alter it otherwise, and you only get one shot 
at using the laser cutter. The full moon is rising,  and in a moment someone
will transform and tear you all apart unless you can cure them first. How can you divide the antidote 
into perfect fifths, cure the secret werewolf, 
and save everyone? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 When it comes to puzzles that
involve cutting and rearranging, it’s often helpful to actually 
take a piece of paper and try cutting it up to see what
you can get. If we cut BF and DH we’d get fourths,
but we need fifths. Maybe there’s a way to shave a bit off
of a quarter to get exactly one fifth. Cutting BE looks good at first, 
but that last cut takes a off a quarter of a quarter, leaving us with a portion of 3/16: 
just smaller than a fifth, and not enough to cure a werewolf. What if we started with BE instead? That would also give us a quarter. And is there a way to shave
just a bit more off? Both DG and CH look promising. If we make one more cut, from A to F, we may start to notice something. With these four cuts—from B to E, 
D to G, F to A, and H to C—we’ve got four triangles and a square in the middle. But the pieces that make 
each triangle can also be rearranged to make a square
identical to the middle one. This means that we’ve split
the antidote into perfect fifths! What’s interesting about this 
sort of problem is that while it’s possible to solve 
it by starting from the geometry, it’s actually easier to start 
experimenting and see where that gets you. That wouldn’t be as viable if the square 
had, say, 24 cut points, but with just 8 there
are only so many reasonable options. You secretly dose each of the townspeople as the full moon emerges in the sky. And just as you do, 
a terrible transformation begins. Then, just as suddenly, it reverses. Your measurements were perfect,  and the people and animals of the 
town can rest a little easier.

**Transcript**:
You’re on the trail of a werewolf that’s been terrorizing your town. After months of detective work, you’ve narrowed your suspects to 
one of five people: the mayor, the tailor, the baker, the grocer, or the carpenter. You’ve invited them to dinner 
with a simple plan: you’ll slip a square of 
a rare werewolf antidote into each of their dinners. Unfortunately, your pet goat
just ate four of the squares, and you only have one left. Luckily, the remaining square is 50 grams, and the minimum effective dose 
is 10 grams. If you can precisely divide the 
square into fifths you’ll have just enough 
antidote for everyone. You’ll have to use a laser-cutting tool
to cut up the square; every other means available to you
isn’t precise enough. There are 8 points that can act 
as starting or ending points for each cut. To use the device, you’ll
have to input pairs of points that tell the laser where to begin 
and end each cut, and then the laser executes
all the cuts simultaneously. It’s okay to cut the square 
into as many pieces as you want, as long as you can group them
into 10 gram portions. But you can’t fold the square 
or alter it otherwise, and you only get one shot 
at using the laser cutter. The full moon is rising,  and in a moment someone
will transform and tear you all apart unless you can cure them first. How can you divide the antidote

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible reason for this mismatch.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of pet in the riddle, which is not related to the main problem of dividing the antidote into perfect fifths. The generated MCQs, on the other hand, are all related to the main problem.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I can suggest that a new generated MCQ that asks about the pet in the riddle could be created, such as:

**Transcript**:
More than six thousand light years from the surface of the earth, a rapidly spinning neutron star called the Black Widow pulsar blasts its companion brown dwarf 
star with radiation as the two orbit each other 
every 9 hours. Standing on our own planet, you might think you’re just an observer
of this violent ballet. But in fact, both stars are pulling you 
towards them. And you’re pulling back, connected across trillions of kilometers by gravity. Gravity is the attractive force 
between two objects with mass— any two objects with mass. Which means that every object in the
universe attracts every other object: every star, black hole, human being, smartphone, and atom are all constantly pulling on each other. So why don’t we feel pulled in billions 
of different directions? Two reasons: mass and distance. The original equation describing the 
gravitational force between two objects was written by Isaac Newton in 1687. Scientists’ understanding of gravity has 
evolved since then, but Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation is still a good approximation 
in most situations. It goes like this: the gravitational force between two 
objects is equal to the mass of one times the mass of the other, multiplied by a very small number called the gravitational constant, and divided by the distance between them, 
squared. If you doubled the mass of one of 
the objects, the force between them would double, too. If the distance between them doubled, the force would be one-fourth as strong. The gravitational force between you and 
the Earth pulls you towards its center, a force you experience as your weight. Let’s say this force is about 800 Newtons when you’re standing at sea level. If you traveled to the Dead Sea, the force would increase by a tiny 
fraction of a percent. And if you climbed to the top of Mount 
Everest, the force would decrease— but again, by a minuscule amount. Traveling higher would make a bigger dent 
in gravity’s influence, but you won’t escape it. Gravity is generated by variations 
in the curvature of spacetime— the three dimensions of space plus time— which bend around any object 
that has mass. Gravity from Earth reaches the 
International Space Station, 400 kilometers above the earth, with almost its original intensity. If the space station was stationary 
on top of a giant column, you’d still experience ninety percent of the gravitational force there 
that you do on the ground. Astronauts just experience weightlessness because the space station is constantly 
falling towards earth. Fortunately, it’s orbiting the planet 
fast enough that it never hits the ground. By the time you made it to 
the surface of the moon, around 400,000 kilometers away, Earth’s gravitational pull would be less than 0.03 percent of 
what you feel on earth. The only gravity you’d be aware of 
would be the moon’s, which is about one sixth as strong 
as the earth’s. Travel farther still and Earth’s gravitational pull on you
will continue to decrease, but never drop to zero. Even safely tethered to the Earth, we’re subject to the faint tug of distant 
celestial bodies and nearby earthly ones. The Sun exerts a force of about 
half a Newton on you. If you’re a few meters away from a 
smartphone, you'll experience a mutual force of a few piconewtons. That’s about the same as the 
gravitational pull between you and the Andromeda Galaxy, which is 2.5 million light years away but about a trillion times as massive 
as the sun. But when it comes to escaping gravity, there’s a loophole. If all the mass around us is 
pulling on us all the time, how would Earth’s gravity change if you tunneled deep below the surface, assuming you could do so without being 
cooked or crushed? If you hollowed out the center 
of a perfectly spherical Earth— which it isn’t, but let’s just say it 
were— you’d experience an identical pull from 
all sides. And you’d be suspended, weightless, only encountering the tiny pulls 
from other celestial bodies. So you could escape the Earth’s gravity 
in such a thought experiment— but only by heading straight into it.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: Why do astronauts experience weightlessness in the International Space Station?**

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. But among the provided generated MCQs, Question 4 is the closest match in terms of topic relevance.

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the percentage of Earth's gravitational force acting on the International Space Station, which is not present among the provided options.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose:

**Question 3 does not match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of relevance, however since it does not match, let's look at another similar question that is related to the International Space Station. Unfortunately, there isn't a direct match, but let's consider another question related to gravitational force at a certain distance or location.**

**Question 7: What is the approximate distance at which the Earth's gravitational pull on an object would decrease to less than 0.03 percent of what it feels on Earth?** 

is not a direct match either.

However, considering another question that might be related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of gravitational force acting at a certain location, I found:

 None of the questions directly match the ground truth MCQ, however **Question 4** is the closest in terms of topic relevance to the International Space Station.

But I will choose a question index that is related to gravitational force at a certain location or distance.

Since there isn't a direct match I will choose an index of a question that might be related to the ground truth MCQ, in terms of gravitational force acting on a location, in this case I will choose:

the surface of the moon, around 400,000 kilometers away, Earth’s gravitational pull would be less than 0.03 percent of 
what you feel on earth. The only gravity you’d be aware of 
would be the moon’s, which is about one sixth as strong 
as the earth’s. Travel farther still and Earth’s gravitational pull on you
will continue to decrease, but never drop to zero. Even safely tethered to the Earth, we’re subject to the faint tug of distant 
celestial bodies and nearby earthly ones. The Sun exerts a force of about 
half a Newton on you. If you’re a few meters away from a 
smartphone, you'll experience a mutual force of a few piconewtons. That’s about the same as the 
gravitational pull between you and the Andromeda Galaxy, which is 2.5 million light years away but about a trillion times as massive 
as the sun. But when it comes to escaping gravity, there’s a loophole. If all the mass around us is 
pulling on us all the time, how would Earth’s gravity change if you tunneled deep below the surface, assuming you could do so without being 
cooked or crushed? If you hollowed out the center 
of a perfectly spherical Earth— which it isn’t, but let’s just say it 
were— you’d experience an identical pull from 
all sides. And you’d be suspended, weightless, only encountering the tiny pulls 
from other celestial bodies. So you could escape the Earth’s gravity 
in such a thought experiment— but only by heading straight into it.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

This question aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is to understand the factors that influence the gravitational force between two masses according to the Law of Universal Gravitation. Although the ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the influence of distance, mass, color, and material, Question 8 addresses the relationship between mass and gravitational force, which is a key aspect of the Law of Universal Gravitation.

However, a more accurate match would be a question that directly addresses the influence of distance on gravitational force. In that case, Question 2 would be a better match, as it specifically asks about the effect of doubling the distance between two objects on the gravitational force between them.

Considering both options, I would recommend Question 2 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it more directly addresses the influence of distance on gravitational force, which is a key aspect of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
More than six thousand light years from the surface of the earth, a rapidly spinning neutron star called the Black Widow pulsar blasts its companion brown dwarf 
star with radiation as the two orbit each other 
every 9 hours. Standing on our own planet, you might think you’re just an observer
of this violent ballet. But in fact, both stars are pulling you 
towards them. And you’re pulling back, connected across trillions of kilometers by gravity. Gravity is the attractive force 
between two objects with mass— any two objects with mass. Which means that every object in the
universe attracts every other object: every star, black hole, human being, smartphone, and atom are all constantly pulling on each other. So why don’t we feel pulled in billions 
of different directions? Two reasons: mass and distance. The original equation describing the 
gravitational force between two objects was written by Isaac Newton in 1687. Scientists’ understanding of gravity has 
evolved since then, but Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation is still a good approximation 
in most situations. It goes like this: the gravitational force between two 
objects is equal to the mass of one times the mass of the other, multiplied by a very small number called the gravitational constant, and divided by the distance between them, 
squared. If you doubled the mass of one of 
the objects, the force between them would double, too. If the distance between them doubled, the force would be one-fourth as strong. The gravitational force between you and 
the Earth pulls you towards its center, a force you experience as your weight. Let’s say this force is about 800 Newtons when you’re standing at sea level. If you traveled to the Dead Sea, the force would increase by a tiny 
fraction of a percent. And if you climbed to the top of Mount 
Everest, the force would decrease— but again, by a minuscule amount. Traveling higher would make a bigger dent 
in gravity’s influence, but you won’t escape it. Gravity is generated by variations 
in the curvature of spacetime— the three dimensions of space plus time— which bend around any object 
that has mass. Gravity from Earth reaches the 
International Space Station, 400 kilometers above the earth, with almost its original intensity. If the space station was stationary 
on top of a giant column, you’d still experience ninety percent of the gravitational force there 
that you do on the ground. Astronauts just experience weightlessness because the space station is constantly 
falling towards earth. Fortunately, it’s orbiting the planet 
fast enough that it never hits the ground. By the time you made it to 
the surface of the moon, around 400,000 kilometers away, Earth’s gravitational pull would be less than 0.03 percent of

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the reach of gravitation, and the correct answer is "Infinite." While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the reach of gravitation, Question 7 asks about the distance at which the Earth's gravitational pull on an object would decrease to less than 0.03 percent of what it feels on Earth. This question indirectly relates to the reach of gravitation, as it discusses how gravity decreases with distance.

However, it's worth noting that the transcript does mention that "gravity is the attractive force between two objects with mass— any two objects with mass. Which means that every object in the universe attracts every other object..." This statement implies that gravity has an infinite reach, but this concept is not directly addressed in any of the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would select Question 7, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as Question 5.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the weight of an astronaut on the surface of the Moon, while Question 5 asks about the approximate percentage of the Earth's gravitational force that an object would experience if it were on the surface of the moon. Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to the gravitational force on the Moon's surface and require an understanding of the Moon's gravity in relation to the Earth's.

The correct option for Question 5 (D. 6%) is not directly equivalent to the correct option for the ground truth MCQ (D. Approx. 15 kg), but both questions require an understanding of the Moon's gravity being about one-sixth of the Earth's.

**Transcript**:
There’s a two-letter word that we hear everywhere. OK. Okay. OK, are you OK Annie? OK OK OK, OK ladies… OK might be the most recognizable word on
the planet. OK! OK. It’s essential to how we communicate with
each other, and even with our technology. Alexa, turn off the living room light. OK. You probably use it every day – even if
you don’t notice it. But, what does OK actually mean? And where did it come from? Hm. OK. Okay then. OK, thank you. OK actually traces back to an 1830s fad of
intentionally misspelling abbreviations. Young “intellectual” types in Boston delighted
those “in the know” with butchered coded messages such as KC, or “knuff ced”, KY,
“know yuse,” and OW, “oll wright.” Haha. But thanks to a couple of lucky breaks, one
abbreviation rose above the rest: OK, or “oll korrect." In the early 1800s, “all correct” was
a common phrase used to confirm that everything was in order. Its abbreviated cousin started going mainstream
on March 23, 1839, when OK was first published in the Boston Morning Post. Soon other papers picked up on the joke and
spread it around the country, until OK was something everyone knew about, not just a
few Boston insiders. And OK’s newfound popularity even prompted
a flailing US president from Kinderhook, New York, to adopt it as a nickname during his
1840 reelection campaign. Van Buren’s supporters formed OK Clubs all
over the country, and their message was pretty clear: Old Kinderhook was “oll korrect.” The campaign was highly publicized and turned
pretty nasty in the press. His opponents ended up turning the abbreviation
around on him, saying it stood for “Orful Konspiracy” or “Orful Katastrophe” Hah. In the end, even a clever nickname didn’t
save Van Buren’s presidency. But it was a win for OK. That 1840 presidential campaign firmly established
OK in the American vernacular. And while similar abbreviations fell out of
fashion, OK made the crossover from slang into legitimate, functional use thanks to
one invention: the telegraph. If we lower the bridge, the current flows
to the sounder. At the other end, the current energizes an
electromagnet and this attracts the armature. The armature clicks down against a screw and
taps out a message. The telegraph debuted in 1844, just five years
after OK. It transmitted short messages in the form
of electric pulses, with combinations of dots and dashes representing letters of the alphabet. This was OK’s moment to shine. The two letters were easy to tap out and very
unlikely to be confused with anything else. It was quickly adopted as a standard acknowledgement
of a transmission received, especially by operators on the expanding US railroad. This telegraphic manual from 1865 even goes
as far as to say that “no message is ever regarded as transmitted until the office receiving
it gives O K.” OK had become serious business. But there’s another big reason the two letters
stuck around, and it’s not just because they’re easy to communicate. It has to do with how OK looks. Or more specifically, how the letter K looks
and sounds. It’s really uncommon to start a word with
the letter K in English — it’s ranked around 22nd in the alphabet. That rarity spurred a “Kraze for K” at
the turn of the century in advertising and print, where companies replaced hard Cs with
Ks in order to Katch your eye. The idea was that modifying a word — like
Klearflax Linen Rugs or this Kook-Rite Stove, for example — would draw more attention
to it. And that’s still a visual strategy: We see
K represented in modern corporate logos, like Krispy-Kreme and Kool-Aid. It’s the K that makes it so memorable. By the 1890s, OK’s Bostonian origins were
already mostly forgotten, and newspapers began to debate its history — often perpetuating
myths in the process that some people still believe. Like the claim that it comes from the Choctaw
word ‘okeh,’ which means ‘so it is.’ Choctaw gave us the word OK… OK’s beginnings had become obscure but it
didn’t really matter anymore — the word was embedded in our language. Today, we use it as the ultimate “neutral
affirmative.” OK then. Okay then. Learn to truly love yourself. OK. OK. Get yourself up here! OK! I don’t know what to say. Say OK. OK. It’s settled then! Allan Metcalf wrote the definitive history
of OK, and he explains that the word “affirms without evaluating,” meaning it doesn’t
convey any feelings — it just acknowledges and accepts information. If you “got home OK,” it just means you
were unharmed. If your “food was OK,” then it was acceptable. And “OK” confirms a change of plans. It’s is sort of a reflex at this point — we
don’t even keep track of how much we use it. Which might be why OK was arguably the first
word spoken when humans landed on the moon. Not bad for a corny joke from the 1830s. Alright guys, cut it out.

intentionally misspelling abbreviations. Young “intellectual” types in Boston delighted
those “in the know” with butchered coded messages such as KC, or “knuff ced”, KY,
“know yuse,” and OW, “oll wright.” Haha. But thanks to a couple of lucky breaks, one
abbreviation rose above the rest: OK, or “oll korrect." In the early 1800s, “all correct” was
a common phrase used to confirm that everything was in order. Its abbreviated cousin started going mainstream
on March 23, 1839, when OK was first published in the Boston Morning Post. Soon other papers picked up on the joke and
spread it around the country, until OK was something everyone knew about, not just a
few Boston insiders. And OK’s newfound popularity even prompted
a flailing US president from Kinderhook, New York, to adopt it as a nickname during his
1840 reelection campaign. Van Buren’s supporters formed OK Clubs all
over the country, and their message was pretty clear: Old Kinderhook was “oll korrect.” The campaign was highly publicized and turned
pretty nasty in the press. His opponents ended up turning the abbreviation
around on him, saying it stood for “Orful Konspiracy” or “Orful Katastrophe” Hah. In the end, even a clever nickname didn’t
save Van Buren’s presidency. But it was a win for OK. That 1840 presidential campaign firmly established
OK in the American vernacular. And while similar abbreviations fell out of
fashion, OK made the crossover from slang into legitimate, functional use thanks to
one invention: the telegraph. If we lower the bridge, the current flows
to the sounder. At the other end, the current energizes an
electromagnet and this attracts the armature. The armature clicks down against a screw and
taps out a message. The telegraph debuted in 1844, just five years
after OK. It transmitted short messages in the form
of electric pulses, with combinations of dots and dashes representing letters of the alphabet. This was OK’s moment to shine. The two letters were easy to tap out and very
unlikely to be confused with anything else. It was quickly adopted as a standard acknowledgement
of a transmission received, especially by operators on the expanding US railroad. This telegraphic manual from 1865 even goes
as far as to say that “no message is ever regarded as transmitted until the office receiving
it gives O K.” OK had become serious business. But there’s another big reason the two letters
stuck around, and it’s not just because they’re easy to communicate. It has to do with how OK looks. Or more specifically, how the letter K looks
and sounds. It’s really uncommon to start a word with
the letter K in English — it’s ranked around 22nd in the alphabet. That rarity spurred a “Kraze for K” at
the turn of the century in advertising and print, where companies replaced hard Cs with
Ks in order to Katch your eye. The idea was that modifying a word — like
Klearflax Linen Rugs or this Kook-Rite Stove, for example — would draw more attention
to it. And that’s still a visual strategy: We see
K represented in modern corporate logos, like Krispy-Kreme and Kool-Aid. It’s the K that makes it so memorable. By the 1890s, OK’s Bostonian origins were
already mostly forgotten, and newspapers began to debate its history — often perpetuating
myths in the process that some people still believe. Like the claim that it comes from the Choctaw
word ‘okeh,’ which means ‘so it is.’ Choctaw gave us the word OK… OK’s beginnings had become obscure but it
didn’t really matter anymore — the word was embedded in our language. Today, we use it as the ultimate “neutral
affirmative.” OK then. Okay then. Learn to truly love yourself. OK. OK. Get yourself up here! OK! I don’t know what to say. Say OK. OK. It’s settled then! Allan Metcalf wrote the definitive history
of OK, and he explains that the word “affirms without evaluating,” meaning it doesn’t
convey any feelings — it just acknowledges and accepts information. If you “got home OK,” it just means you
were unharmed. If your “food was OK,” then it was acceptable. And “OK” confirms a change of plans. It’s is sort of a reflex at this point — we
don’t even keep track of how much we use it. Which might be why OK was arguably the first
word spoken when humans landed on the moon. Not bad for a corny joke from the 1830s. Alright guys, cut it out.

**Transcript**:
Just between your chest and abdomen is where you’ll find one of the most
important muscles you probably didn't know you had: the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES. When functioning properly, this ring of tissue plays a crucial
role in helping us eat. But when the LES malfunctions, it becomes the main player in heartburn --a searing, sometimes sour-tasting
chest-spasm that many people will experience
at some point in their lives. We know that humans have
been battling heartburn for hundreds, if not thousands of years. But recently the incidence has risen, making it a common stomach 
complaint worldwide. When the symptoms of heartburn become more
more regular and intense —such as twice a week or more-- it’s diagnosed as Gastroesophageal
Reflux Disease, or GERD. But what causes this problem, and how can it be stopped? Heartburn starts in an area called the gastroesophageal junction, 
where the LES resides. This smooth, muscular ring of the LES is moderated by an intricate 
tree of nerve roots that connect to the brain, 
the heart, and the lungs. After food enters the stomach
from the esophagus, the muscle’s task is to stop it from surging back up again. The LES contracts, squeezing 
the stomach entrance and creating a high pressure zone that prevents digestive acids 
from seeping out. But if the LES relaxes at the
wrong moment or gradually weakens, it becomes like a faulty, ill-fitting lid, causing the area to depressurize. That allows burning stomach acid-- and even chunks of food--to spurt into the esophagus, sometimes going 
as far up as the mouth. The cause of all this internal drama has long been put down to diet. Foods like caffeine and peppermint contain ingredients that may have a
relaxing affect on the LES, which makes it incapable of doing its job. Other acidic foods, 
like citrus and tomatoes, can worsen irritation of the esophagus when they leach out with stomach acid. Carbonated beverages can similarly bubble up in the stomach, forcing open the valve. But researchers have discovered
that food isn’t the only trigger. Smoking poses a risk, because the nicotine
in cigarettes relaxes the LES. Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol may have a similar effect. Pregnant women often experience
more heartburn due to the pressure of a growing baby
on their stomachs. and the levels of certain hormones 
in their bodies. Obesity can cause hernias that disrupt the anti-reflux barrier of
the gastroesophageal junction that normally protects 
against heartburn. Numerous medications, 
including those for asthma, high blood pressure, birth control, 
and depression can also have unintended 
effects on the LES. An occasional bout of heartburn isn't necessarily something to worry about. But, if heartburn starts happening regularly, it can weaken the LES muscle over time, letting more and more acid escape. And if it goes untreated, this can cause bigger problems. Over time, constant acid 
leakage from heartburn may form scar tissue which narrows the esophageal tube, making it 
harder to swallow food. Ongoing reflux can also damage the cells lining the esophagus--a rare
condition called Barrett’s esophagus, which can elevate the risk of esophageal cancer. Luckily, heartburn is often treatable with a range of medicines that can help neutralize or reduce stomach acid. In extreme cases, some people have surgery to tighten the LES to 
minimize their distress. But we can often stop heartburn before it reaches that point. Reducing the consumption 
of certain foods, not smoking, and maintaining 
a healthy weight can all dramatically reduce reflux. With proper care we can 
help our LES’s keep the chemical fountain of 
our stomachs in proper order and avoid having to feel the burn.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of reflux.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the "cardinal complaints of reflux," which implies the primary symptoms associated with reflux. Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the closest in terms of topic relevance, as it asks about the condition diagnosed when the symptoms of heartburn become regular and intense (GERD). However, it does not specifically ask about the cardinal complaints of reflux.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**Index: 3**

Please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the question about the cardinal complaints of reflux. A more accurate generated MCQ would be needed to match the ground truth MCQ.

against heartburn. Numerous medications, 
including those for asthma, high blood pressure, birth control, 
and depression can also have unintended 
effects on the LES. An occasional bout of heartburn isn't necessarily something to worry about. But, if heartburn starts happening regularly, it can weaken the LES muscle over time, letting more and more acid escape. And if it goes untreated, this can cause bigger problems. Over time, constant acid 
leakage from heartburn may form scar tissue which narrows the esophageal tube, making it 
harder to swallow food. Ongoing reflux can also damage the cells lining the esophagus--a rare
condition called Barrett’s esophagus, which can elevate the risk of esophageal cancer. Luckily, heartburn is often treatable with a range of medicines that can help neutralize or reduce stomach acid. In extreme cases, some people have surgery to tighten the LES to 
minimize their distress. But we can often stop heartburn before it reaches that point. Reducing the consumption 
of certain foods, not smoking, and maintaining 
a healthy weight can all dramatically reduce reflux. With proper care we can 
help our LES’s keep the chemical fountain of 
our stomachs in proper order and avoid having to feel the burn.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest the generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the composition of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), while the generated MCQs focus on its location, function, and related conditions.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the most relevant, as it asks about the primary function of the LES when functioning properly. However, it does not directly address the composition of the LES.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will select the one that is most closely related to the LES.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2

Please note that this selection is based on the closest match, but it is not an exact match. A more accurate generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the composition of the LES, with options similar to those in the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Just between your chest and abdomen is where you’ll find one of the most
important muscles you probably didn't know you had: the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES. When functioning properly, this ring of tissue plays a crucial
role in helping us eat. But when the LES malfunctions, it becomes the main player in heartburn --a searing, sometimes sour-tasting
chest-spasm that many people will experience
at some point in their lives. We know that humans have
been battling heartburn for hundreds, if not thousands of years. But recently the incidence has risen, making it a common stomach 
complaint worldwide. When the symptoms of heartburn become more
more regular and intense —such as twice a week or more-- it’s diagnosed as Gastroesophageal
Reflux Disease, or GERD. But what causes this problem, and how can it be stopped? Heartburn starts in an area called the gastroesophageal junction, 
where the LES resides. This smooth, muscular ring of the LES is moderated by an intricate 
tree of nerve roots that connect to the brain, 
the heart, and the lungs. After food enters the stomach
from the esophagus, the muscle’s task is to stop it from surging back up again. The LES contracts, squeezing 
the stomach entrance and creating a high pressure zone that prevents digestive acids 
from seeping out. But if the LES relaxes at the
wrong moment or gradually weakens, it becomes like a faulty, ill-fitting lid, causing the area to depressurize. That allows burning stomach acid-- and even chunks of food--to spurt into the esophagus, sometimes going 
as far up as the mouth. The cause of all this internal drama has long been put down to diet. Foods like caffeine and peppermint contain ingredients that may have a
relaxing affect on the LES, which makes it incapable of doing its job. Other acidic foods, 
like citrus and tomatoes, can worsen irritation of the esophagus when they leach out with stomach acid. Carbonated beverages can similarly bubble up in the stomach, forcing open the valve. But researchers have discovered
that food isn’t the only trigger. Smoking poses a risk, because the nicotine
in cigarettes relaxes the LES. Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol may have a similar effect. Pregnant women often experience
more heartburn due to the pressure of a growing baby
on their stomachs. and the levels of certain hormones 
in their bodies. Obesity can cause hernias that disrupt the anti-reflux barrier of
the gastroesophageal junction that normally protects 
against heartburn. Numerous medications, 
including those for asthma, high blood pressure, birth control, 
and depression can also have unintended 
effects on the LES. An occasional bout of heartburn isn't necessarily something to worry about. But, if heartburn starts happening regularly, it can weaken the LES muscle over time, letting more and more acid escape. And if it goes untreated, this can cause bigger problems. Over time, constant acid 
leakage from heartburn may form scar tissue which narrows the esophageal tube, making it 
harder to swallow food. Ongoing reflux can also damage the cells lining the esophagus--a rare
condition called Barrett’s esophagus, which can elevate the risk of esophageal cancer. Luckily, heartburn is often treatable with a range of medicines that can help neutralize or reduce stomach acid. In extreme cases, some people have surgery to tighten the LES to

**Transcript**:
Spindly trees, rusted gates, crumbling stone, a solitary mourner— these things come to mind 
when we think of cemeteries. But not so long ago, many burial grounds were lively places, with blooming gardens and crowds of people strolling among the headstones. How did our cemeteries 
become what they are today? Some have been around for centuries, like the world’s largest, Wadi al-Salaam, where more than five million 
people are buried. But most of the places we’d recognize 
as cemeteries are much younger. In fact, for much of human history, we didn’t bury our dead at all. Our ancient ancestors had many other ways 
of parting with the dead loved ones. Some were left in caves, others in trees or on mountaintops. Still others were sunk in lakes, put out to sea, ritually cannibalized, or cremated. All of these practices, though some may seem strange today, were ways of venerating the dead. By contrast, the first known burials about 120,000 years ago were likely reserved for transgressors, excluding them from the usual rites intended to honor the dead. But the first burials revealed some
advantages over other practices: they protected bodies from scavengers 
and the elements, while shielding loved ones from the 
sight of decay. These benefits may have shifted 
ancient people’s thinking toward graves designed to honor the dead, and burial became more common. Sometimes, these graves contained 
practical or ritual objects, suggesting belief in an afterlife Communal burials first appeared in North 
Africa and West Asia around 10 to 15,000 years ago, around the same time as the first 
permanent settlements in these areas. These burial grounds created permanent 
places to commemorate the dead. The nomadic Scythians littered the steppes with grave mounds known as kurgans. The Etruscans built expansive necropoles, their grid-patterned streets 
lined with tombs. In Rome, subterranean catacombs housed both cremation urns and intact remains. The word cemetery, or “sleeping chamber,” was first used by ancient Greeks, who built tombs in graveyards at the edges of their cities. In medieval European cities, Christian churchyards provided 
rare, open spaces that accommodated the dead, but also hosted markets, fairs, 
and other events. Farmers even grazed cattle in them, believing graveyard grass made 
for sweeter milk. As cities grew during the industrial 
revolution, large suburban cemeteries replaced 
smaller urban churchyards. Cemeteries like the 110-acre 
Père-Lachaise in Paris or the 72-acre Mt. Auburn 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts were lushly landscaped gardens filled with sculpted stones and ornate tombs. Once a luxury reserved for the rich 
and powerful, individually marked graves became available to the middle 
and working classes. People visited cemeteries for funerals, but also for anniversaries, holidays, or simply an afternoon outdoors. By the late 19th century, as more public 
parks and botanical gardens appeared, cemeteries began to lose visitors. Today, many old cemeteries are 
lonely places. Some are luring visitors back with tours, concerts, and other attractions. But even as we revive old cemeteries, we’re rethinking the future of burial. Cities like London, New York, and 
Hong Kong are running out of burial space. Even in places where space isn’t so tight, cemeteries permanently occupy land that can’t be otherwise cultivated 
or developed. Traditional burial consumes materials like metal, stone, and concrete, and can pollute soil and groundwater with toxic chemicals. With increasing awareness of the 
environmental costs, people are seeking alternatives. Many are turning to cremation and 
related practices. Along with these more conventional 
practices, people can now have their remains 
shot into space, used to fertilize a tree, or made into jewelry, fireworks, and even tattoo ink. In the future, options like these may 
replace burial completely. Cemeteries may be our most familiar 
monuments to the departed, but they’re just one step in our ever-evolving process of remembering and honoring the dead.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the topic and intent, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but only because it mentions a specific term related to cemeteries (Wadi al-Salaam), and the ground truth MCQ asks about the origin of the word "cemetery". But the question intent and options are still quite different.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that directly address the origin and meaning of the word "cemetery", and then try to find a match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: 3 (but with the caveat that it's not a good match).

**Transcript**:
Spindly trees, rusted gates, crumbling stone, a solitary mourner— these things come to mind 
when we think of cemeteries. But not so long ago, many burial grounds were lively places, with blooming gardens and crowds of people strolling among the headstones. How did our cemeteries 
become what they are today? Some have been around for centuries, like the world’s largest, Wadi al-Salaam, where more than five million 
people are buried. But most of the places we’d recognize 
as cemeteries are much younger. In fact, for much of human history, we didn’t bury our dead at all. Our ancient ancestors had many other ways 
of parting with the dead loved ones. Some were left in caves, others in trees or on mountaintops. Still others were sunk in lakes, put out to sea, ritually cannibalized, or cremated. All of these practices, though some may seem strange today, were ways of venerating the dead. By contrast, the first known burials about 120,000 years ago were likely reserved for transgressors, excluding them from the usual rites intended to honor the dead. But the first burials revealed some
advantages over other practices: they protected bodies from scavengers 
and the elements, while shielding loved ones from the 
sight of decay. These benefits may have shifted 
ancient people’s thinking toward graves designed to honor the dead, and burial became more common. Sometimes, these graves contained 
practical or ritual objects, suggesting belief in an afterlife Communal burials first appeared in North 
Africa and West Asia around 10 to 15,000 years ago, around the same time as the first 
permanent settlements in these areas. These burial grounds created permanent 
places to commemorate the dead. The nomadic Scythians littered the steppes with grave mounds known as kurgans. The Etruscans built expansive necropoles, their grid-patterned streets 
lined with tombs. In Rome, subterranean catacombs housed both cremation urns and intact remains. The word cemetery, or “sleeping chamber,” was first used by ancient Greeks, who built tombs in graveyards at the edges of their cities. In medieval European cities, Christian churchyards provided 
rare, open spaces that accommodated the dead, but also hosted markets, fairs, 
and other events. Farmers even grazed cattle in them, believing graveyard grass made 
for sweeter milk. As cities grew during the industrial 
revolution, large suburban cemeteries replaced 
smaller urban churchyards. Cemeteries like the 110-acre 
Père-Lachaise in Paris or the 72-acre Mt. Auburn 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts were lushly landscaped gardens filled with sculpted stones and ornate tombs. Once a luxury reserved for the rich 
and powerful, individually marked graves became available to the middle 
and working classes. People visited cemeteries for funerals, but also for anniversaries, holidays, or simply an afternoon outdoors. By the late 19th century, as more public 
parks and botanical gardens appeared, cemeteries began to lose visitors. Today, many old cemeteries are 
lonely places. Some are luring visitors back with tours, concerts, and other attractions. But even as we revive old cemeteries, we’re rethinking the future of burial. Cities like London, New York, and 
Hong Kong are running out of burial space. Even in places where space isn’t so tight, cemeteries permanently occupy land that can’t be otherwise cultivated 
or developed. Traditional burial consumes materials like metal, stone, and concrete, and can pollute soil and groundwater with toxic chemicals. With increasing awareness of the 
environmental costs, people are seeking alternatives. Many are turning to cremation and 
related practices. Along with these more conventional 
practices, people can now have their remains 
shot into space, used to fertilize a tree, or made into jewelry, fireworks, and even tattoo ink. In the future, options like these may 
replace burial completely. Cemeteries may be our most familiar 
monuments to the departed, but they’re just one step in our ever-evolving process of remembering and honoring the dead.

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1895, 
crowds flooded the Coney Island boardwalk to see the latest marvel 
of roller coaster technology: the Flip Flap Railway. This was America’s first-ever looping coaster – but its thrilling flip came at a price. The ride caused numerous cases of 
severe whiplash, neck injury and even ejections, all due to its signature loop. Today, coasters can pull off 
far more exciting tricks, without resorting to the “thrill” 
of a hospital visit. But what exactly are roller coasters 
doing to your body, and how have they managed to get scarier
and safer at the same time? At the center of every roller coaster 
design is gravity. Unlike cars or transit trains, most coasters are propelled around their tracks almost entirely by gravitational energy. After the coaster crests the initial lift hill, it begins an expertly engineered cycle – building potential energy on ascents
and expending kinetic energy on descents. This rhythm repeats throughout the ride, acting out the coaster engineer’s
choreographed dance of gravitational energy. But there’s a key variable in this cycle
that wasn’t always so carefully considered: you. In the days of the Flip-Flap, ride designers were most concerned 
with coasters getting stuck somewhere along the track. This led early builders to overcompensate, hurling trains down hills and pulling on the brakes 
when they reached the station. But as gravity affects the cars, 
it also affects the passengers. And under the intense conditions
of a coaster, gravity’s effects are multiplied. There’s a common unit used by jet pilots, astronauts, and coaster designers called “g force”. One G force is the familiar tug of gravity
you feel when standing on Earth – this is the force of Earth’s 
gravitational pull on our bodies. But as riders accelerate and decelerate, they experience more or less 
gravitational force. Modern ride designers know that the 
body can handle up to roughly 5 Gs, but the Flip-Flap and its contemporaries 
routinely reached up to 12 Gs. At those levels of gravitational pressure, blood is sent flying from your brain
to your feet, leading to light-headedness or blackouts as the brain struggles to stay conscious. And oxygen deprivation in the retinal cells
impairs their ability to process light, causing greyed out vision or temporary blindness. If the riders are upside down,
blood can flood the skull, causing a bout of crimson vision
called a “redout”. Conversely, negative G’s 
create weightlessness. Within the body, short-term weightlessness
is mostly harmless. It can contribute to a rider’s 
motion sickness by suspending the fluid in 
their inner ears which coordinates balance. But the bigger potential danger – and thrill – comes from what ride designers 
call airtime. This is when riders typically
experience seat separation, and, without the proper precautions, ejection. The numerous belts and harnesses 
of modern coasters have largely solved this issue, but the passenger’s ever-changing position
can make it difficult to determine what needs to be 
strapped down. Fortunately, modern ride designers
are well aware of what your body, and the coaster, can handle. Coaster engineers play these competing 
forces against each other, to relieve periods of intense pressure
with periods of no pressure at all. And since a quick transition from 
positive to negative G-force can result in whiplash, headaches, 
and back and neck pain, they avoid the extreme changes
in speed and direction so common in thrill rides of old. Modern rides are also much sturdier, closely considering the amount
of gravity they need to withstand. At 5 G’s, your body feels 5 times heavier; so if you weigh 100lbs, you’d exert the weight of 500 lbs
on the coaster. Engineers have to account for 
the multiplied weight of every passenger when designing 
a coaster’s supports. Still, these rides aren’t for everyone. The floods of adrenaline, 
light-headedness, and motion sickness aren’t going anywhere soon. But today’s redundant restraints, 
3D modeling and simulation software have made roller coasters safer 
and more thrilling than ever. Our precise knowledge about the 
limits of the human body have helped us build coasters that are 
faster, taller, and loopier – and all without going off the rails.

Since there isn't a direct match among the provided generated MCQs, I will choose the one that is most closely related to the concept of energy conversion in roller coasters. 

However, none of the generated MCQs directly address the concept of energy conversion. If I had to choose one that is tangentially related to the concept of roller coaster physics, I would choose:

 Question 1 is not the best match, but Question 3 does mention a related concept of gravitational force (G force) experienced by riders in a roller coaster.

So the closest match would be Question 3, although it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1895, 
crowds flooded the Coney Island boardwalk to see the latest marvel 
of roller coaster technology: the Flip Flap Railway. This was America’s first-ever looping coaster – but its thrilling flip came at a price. The ride caused numerous cases of 
severe whiplash, neck injury and even ejections, all due to its signature loop. Today, coasters can pull off 
far more exciting tricks, without resorting to the “thrill” 
of a hospital visit. But what exactly are roller coasters 
doing to your body, and how have they managed to get scarier
and safer at the same time? At the center of every roller coaster 
design is gravity. Unlike cars or transit trains, most coasters are propelled around their tracks almost entirely by gravitational energy. After the coaster crests the initial lift hill, it begins an expertly engineered cycle – building potential energy on ascents
and expending kinetic energy on descents. This rhythm repeats throughout the ride, acting out the coaster engineer’s
choreographed dance of gravitational energy. But there’s a key variable in this cycle
that wasn’t always so carefully considered: you. In the days of the Flip-Flap, ride designers were most concerned 
with coasters getting stuck somewhere along the track. This led early builders to overcompensate, hurling trains down hills and pulling on the brakes 
when they reached the station. But as gravity affects the cars, 
it also affects the passengers. And under the intense conditions
of a coaster, gravity’s effects are multiplied. There’s a common unit used by jet pilots, astronauts, and coaster designers called “g force”. One G force is the familiar tug of gravity
you feel when standing on Earth – this is the force of Earth’s 
gravitational pull on our bodies. But as riders accelerate and decelerate, they experience more or less 
gravitational force. Modern ride designers know that the 
body can handle up to roughly 5 Gs, but the Flip-Flap and its contemporaries 
routinely reached up to 12 Gs. At those levels of gravitational pressure, blood is sent flying from your brain
to your feet, leading to light-headedness or blackouts as the brain struggles to stay conscious. And oxygen deprivation in the retinal cells
impairs their ability to process light, causing greyed out vision or temporary blindness. If the riders are upside down,
blood can flood the skull, causing a bout of crimson vision
called a “redout”. Conversely, negative G’s 
create weightlessness. Within the body, short-term weightlessness
is mostly harmless. It can contribute to a rider’s 
motion sickness by suspending the fluid in 
their inner ears which coordinates balance. But the bigger potential danger – and thrill – comes from what ride designers 
call airtime. This is when riders typically
experience seat separation, and, without the proper precautions, ejection. The numerous belts and harnesses 
of modern coasters have largely solved this issue, but the passenger’s ever-changing position
can make it difficult to determine what needs to be 
strapped down. Fortunately, modern ride designers
are well aware of what your body, and the coaster, can handle. Coaster engineers play these competing 
forces against each other, to relieve periods of intense pressure
with periods of no pressure at all. And since a quick transition from 
positive to negative G-force can result in whiplash, headaches, 
and back and neck pain, they avoid the extreme changes
in speed and direction so common in thrill rides of old. Modern rides are also much sturdier, closely considering the amount
of gravity they need to withstand. At 5 G’s, your body feels 5 times heavier; so if you weigh 100lbs, you’d exert the weight of 500 lbs
on the coaster. Engineers have to account for 
the multiplied weight of every passenger when designing 
a coaster’s supports. Still, these rides aren’t for everyone. The floods of adrenaline, 
light-headedness, and motion sickness aren’t going anywhere soon. But today’s redundant restraints, 
3D modeling and simulation software have made roller coasters safer 
and more thrilling than ever. Our precise knowledge about the 
limits of the human body have helped us build coasters that are 
faster, taller, and loopier – and all without going off the rails.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 3 does not cover all the symptoms mentioned in the ground truth MCQ, I re-examined the generated MCQs and found that Questions 3, 4, 5, and 6 cover some of the symptoms mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. 

Among these, Question 6 is the closest match in terms of content, as it covers one of the symptoms mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (redout). However, it does not cover all the symptoms.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that best covers the content and intent. 

In this case, I would recommend generating new MCQs that exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would choose Question 6, as it is the closest match in terms of content.

and expending kinetic energy on descents. This rhythm repeats throughout the ride, acting out the coaster engineer’s
choreographed dance of gravitational energy. But there’s a key variable in this cycle
that wasn’t always so carefully considered: you. In the days of the Flip-Flap, ride designers were most concerned 
with coasters getting stuck somewhere along the track. This led early builders to overcompensate, hurling trains down hills and pulling on the brakes 
when they reached the station. But as gravity affects the cars, 
it also affects the passengers. And under the intense conditions
of a coaster, gravity’s effects are multiplied. There’s a common unit used by jet pilots, astronauts, and coaster designers called “g force”. One G force is the familiar tug of gravity
you feel when standing on Earth – this is the force of Earth’s 
gravitational pull on our bodies. But as riders accelerate and decelerate, they experience more or less 
gravitational force. Modern ride designers know that the 
body can handle up to roughly 5 Gs, but the Flip-Flap and its contemporaries 
routinely reached up to 12 Gs. At those levels of gravitational pressure, blood is sent flying from your brain
to your feet, leading to light-headedness or blackouts as the brain struggles to stay conscious. And oxygen deprivation in the retinal cells
impairs their ability to process light, causing greyed out vision or temporary blindness. If the riders are upside down,
blood can flood the skull, causing a bout of crimson vision
called a “redout”. Conversely, negative G’s 
create weightlessness. Within the body, short-term weightlessness
is mostly harmless. It can contribute to a rider’s 
motion sickness by suspending the fluid in 
their inner ears which coordinates balance. But the bigger potential danger – and thrill – comes from what ride designers 
call airtime. This is when riders typically
experience seat separation, and, without the proper precautions, ejection. The numerous belts and harnesses 
of modern coasters have largely solved this issue, but the passenger’s ever-changing position
can make it difficult to determine what needs to be 
strapped down. Fortunately, modern ride designers
are well aware of what your body, and the coaster, can handle. Coaster engineers play these competing 
forces against each other, to relieve periods of intense pressure
with periods of no pressure at all. And since a quick transition from 
positive to negative G-force can result in whiplash, headaches, 
and back and neck pain, they avoid the extreme changes
in speed and direction so common in thrill rides of old. Modern rides are also much sturdier, closely considering the amount
of gravity they need to withstand. At 5 G’s, your body feels 5 times heavier; so if you weigh 100lbs, you’d exert the weight of 500 lbs
on the coaster. Engineers have to account for 
the multiplied weight of every passenger when designing 
a coaster’s supports. Still, these rides aren’t for everyone. The floods of adrenaline, 
light-headedness, and motion sickness aren’t going anywhere soon. But today’s redundant restraints, 
3D modeling and simulation software have made roller coasters safer 
and more thrilling than ever. Our precise knowledge about the 
limits of the human body have helped us build coasters that are 
faster, taller, and loopier – and all without going off the rails.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but it is related to the concept of G-force and its effect on the human body.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 3: What is the maximum amount of gravitational force that the human body can handle? Options: A. 5 Gs, B. 10 Gs, C. 12 Gs, D. 15 Gs Correct Option: A

However, this question does not directly ask about the effect of 5-Gs on a person's weight. 

A more relevant question that could match the ground truth MCQ would be one that asks about the effect of G-force on a person's weight, but such a question is not present in the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose Question 3, but with the understanding that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
One of the kingdom’s
most prosperous merchants has been exposed for his corrupt dealings. Nearly all of his riches are invested in a collection of 30 exquisite Burmese rubies, and the crowd in the square is clamoring for their confiscation to reimburse his victims. But the scoundrel and his allies at court have made a convincing case that at least some of his wealth was obtained legitimately, and through good service to the crown. The king ponders for a minute and announces his judgment. Because there’s no way to know which portion of the rubies 
were bought with ill-gotten wealth, the fine will be determined through 
a game of wits between the merchant and the king’s most clever advisor – you. You’re both told the rules in advance. The merchant will be allowed to
discreetly divide his rubies among three boxes, which
will then be placed in front of you. You will be given three cards, and must write a number 
between 1 and 30 on each, before putting a card in
front of each of the boxes. The boxes will then all be opened. For each box, you will receive exactly as many rubies as the number written
on the corresponding card, if the box has that many. But if your number is greater than 
the number of rubies actually there, the scoundrel gets to keep the entire box. The king puts just two constraints on how
the scoundrel distributes his rubies. Each box must contain at least two rubies and one of the boxes must contain 
exactly six more rubies than another— but you won’t know which boxes those are. After a few minutes of deliberation, the merchant hides the gems, 
and the boxes are brought in front of you. Which numbers should you choose in order to guarantee the largest possible
fine for the scoundrel and the greatest compensation 
for his victims? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You don’t want to overshoot
by being too greedy. But there is a way you can guarantee to get more than half of the scoundrel’s 
stash. The situation resembles an 
adversarial game like chess – only here you can’t see the 
opponent’s position. To figure out the minimum number of rubies
you’re guaranteed to win, you need to look for the worst case
scenario, as if the merchant already knew your move and could arrange the rubies 
to minimize your winnings. Because you have no way of knowing which
boxes will have more or fewer rubies, you should pick the same number for each. Suppose you write three 9’s. The scoundrel might have allocated the
rubies as 8, 14 and 8. In that case, you’d receive 9 from the
middle box and no others. On the other hand, you can be
sure that at least two boxes have a minimum of 8 rubies. Here’s why. We’ll start by assuming the opposite, that two boxes have 7 or fewer. Those could not be the two that 
differ by 6, because every box must have 
at least 2 rubies. In that case, the third box would have at
most 13 rubies—that’s 7 plus 6. Add up all three of those boxes, and the most that could equal is 27. Since that’s less than 30, this scenario isn’t possible. You now know, by what’s called
a proof by contradiction, that two of the boxes have 
8 or more rubies. If you ask for 8 from all three boxes you’ll receive at least 16— and that’s the best you can guarantee, as you can see by thinking again
about the 8, 14, 8 scenario. You’ve recovered more than half the 
scoundrel’s fortune as restitution for the public. And though he’s managed to hold
on to some of his rubies, his fortune has definitely 
lost some of its shine.

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not ask about the smallest number that would result in receiving nothing.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ closely. If I had to choose, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but it's still not a good match.

**Transcript**:
One of the kingdom’s
most prosperous merchants has been exposed for his corrupt dealings. Nearly all of his riches are invested in a collection of 30 exquisite Burmese rubies, and the crowd in the square is clamoring for their confiscation to reimburse his victims. But the scoundrel and his allies at court have made a convincing case that at least some of his wealth was obtained legitimately, and through good service to the crown. The king ponders for a minute and announces his judgment. Because there’s no way to know which portion of the rubies 
were bought with ill-gotten wealth, the fine will be determined through 
a game of wits between the merchant and the king’s most clever advisor – you. You’re both told the rules in advance. The merchant will be allowed to
discreetly divide his rubies among three boxes, which
will then be placed in front of you. You will be given three cards, and must write a number 
between 1 and 30 on each, before putting a card in
front of each of the boxes. The boxes will then all be opened. For each box, you will receive exactly as many rubies as the number written
on the corresponding card, if the box has that many. But if your number is greater than 
the number of rubies actually there, the scoundrel gets to keep the entire box. The king puts just two constraints on how
the scoundrel distributes his rubies. Each box must contain at least two rubies and one of the boxes must contain 
exactly six more rubies than another— but you won’t know which boxes those are. After a few minutes of deliberation, the merchant hides the gems, 
and the boxes are brought in front of you. Which numbers should you choose in order to guarantee the largest possible
fine for the scoundrel and the greatest compensation 
for his victims? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You don’t want to overshoot
by being too greedy. But there is a way you can guarantee to get more than half of the scoundrel’s 
stash. The situation resembles an 
adversarial game like chess – only here you can’t see the 
opponent’s position. To figure out the minimum number of rubies
you’re guaranteed to win, you need to look for the worst case
scenario, as if the merchant already knew your move and could arrange the rubies 
to minimize your winnings. Because you have no way of knowing which
boxes will have more or fewer rubies, you should pick the same number for each. Suppose you write three 9’s. The scoundrel might have allocated the
rubies as 8, 14 and 8. In that case, you’d receive 9 from the
middle box and no others. On the other hand, you can be
sure that at least two boxes have a minimum of 8 rubies. Here’s why. We’ll start by assuming the opposite, that two boxes have 7 or fewer. Those could not be the two that 
differ by 6, because every box must have 
at least 2 rubies. In that case, the third box would have at
most 13 rubies—that’s 7 plus 6. Add up all three of those boxes, and the most that could equal is 27. Since that’s less than 30, this scenario isn’t possible. You now know, by what’s called
a proof by contradiction, that two of the boxes have 
8 or more rubies. If you ask for 8 from all three boxes you’ll receive at least 16— and that’s the best you can guarantee, as you can see by thinking again
about the 8, 14, 8 scenario. You’ve recovered more than half the 
scoundrel’s fortune as restitution for the public. And though he’s managed to hold
on to some of his rubies, his fortune has definitely 
lost some of its shine.

**Transcript**:
The earliest time measurements were observations of cycles of the natural world, using patterns of changes from day to night and season to season to build calendars. More precise time-keeping, like sundials and mechanical clocks, eventually came along to put time in more convenient boxes. But what exactly is it that we’re measuring? Is time something that physically exists, or is it just in our heads? At first the answer seems obvious— of course time exists; it constantly unfolds all around us, and it’s hard to imagine the universe without it. But our understanding of time started getting complicated thanks to Einstein. His theory of relativity tells us that time passes for everyone, but doesn’t always pass at the same rate for people in different situations, like those travelling close to the speed of light or orbiting a supermassive black hole. Einstein resolved the malleability of time by combining it with space to define space-time, which can bend, but behaves
in consistent, predictable ways. Einstein’s theory seemed to confirm that time is woven into the very fabric of the universe. But there’s a big question it didn’t fully resolve: why is it we can move through space in any direction, but through time in only one? No matter what we do, the past is always, stubbornly, behind us. This is called the arrow of time. When a drop of food coloring is dropped into a glass of water, we instinctively know that the coloring will drift out from the drop, eventually filling the glass. Imagine watching the opposite happen. Here, we’d recognize time as unfolding backwards. We live in a universe where the food coloring spreads out in the water,  not a universe where it collects together. In physics, this is described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says that systems will gain disorder, or entropy, over time. Systems in our universe move from order to disorder, and it is that property of the universe that defines the direction of time’s arrow. So if time is such a fundamental property, it should be in our most fundamental equations describing the universe, right? We currently have two sets of equations that govern physics. General relativity describes the behavior of very large things, while quantum physics explains the very small. One of the biggest goals in theoretical physics over the last half century has been reconciling the two into one fundamental “theory of everything." There have been many attempts —none yet proven— and they treat time in different ways. Oddly enough, one contender called the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, doesn’t include time at all. Like all current theories of everything, that equation is speculative. But as a thought experiment, if it or a similarly time-starved equation turned out to be true, would that mean that time doesn’t exist, at the most fundamental level? Could time just be some sort of illusion generated by the limitations of the way we perceive the universe? We don’t yet know, but maybe that’s the wrong way of thinking about it. Instead of asking if time exists as a fundamental property, maybe it could exist as an emergent one. Emergent properties are things that don’t exist in individual pieces of a system, but do exist for the system as a whole. Each individual water molecule doesn’t have a tide, but the whole ocean does. A movie creates change through time by using a series of still images that appear to have a fluid, continuous change between them. Flipping through the images fast enough, our brains perceive the passage of time from the sequence of still images. No individual frame of the movie changes or contains the passage of time, but it’s a property that comes out of how the pieces are strung together. The movement is real, yet also an illusion. Could the physics of time somehow be a similar illusion? Physicists are still exploring these and other questions, so we’re far from a complete explanation. At least for the moment.

**Transcript**:
The earliest time measurements were observations of cycles of the natural world, using patterns of changes from day to night and season to season to build calendars. More precise time-keeping, like sundials and mechanical clocks, eventually came along to put time in more convenient boxes. But what exactly is it that we’re measuring? Is time something that physically exists, or is it just in our heads? At first the answer seems obvious— of course time exists; it constantly unfolds all around us, and it’s hard to imagine the universe without it. But our understanding of time started getting complicated thanks to Einstein. His theory of relativity tells us that time passes for everyone, but doesn’t always pass at the same rate for people in different situations, like those travelling close to the speed of light or orbiting a supermassive black hole. Einstein resolved the malleability of time by combining it with space to define space-time, which can bend, but behaves
in consistent, predictable ways. Einstein’s theory seemed to confirm that time is woven into the very fabric of the universe. But there’s a big question it didn’t fully resolve: why is it we can move through space in any direction, but through time in only one? No matter what we do, the past is always, stubbornly, behind us. This is called the arrow of time. When a drop of food coloring is dropped into a glass of water, we instinctively know that the coloring will drift out from the drop, eventually filling the glass. Imagine watching the opposite happen. Here, we’d recognize time as unfolding backwards. We live in a universe where the food coloring spreads out in the water,  not a universe where it collects together. In physics, this is described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says that systems will gain disorder, or entropy, over time. Systems in our universe move from order to disorder, and it is that property of the universe that defines the direction of time’s arrow. So if time is such a fundamental property, it should be in our most fundamental equations describing the universe, right? We currently have two sets of equations that govern physics. General relativity describes the behavior of very large things, while quantum physics explains the very small. One of the biggest goals in theoretical physics over the last half century has been reconciling the two into one fundamental “theory of everything." There have been many attempts —none yet proven— and they treat time in different ways. Oddly enough, one contender called the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, doesn’t include time at all. Like all current theories of everything, that equation is speculative. But as a thought experiment, if it or a similarly time-starved equation turned out to be true, would that mean that time doesn’t exist, at the most fundamental level? Could time just be some sort of illusion generated by the limitations of the way we perceive the universe? We don’t yet know, but maybe that’s the wrong way of thinking about it. Instead of asking if time exists as a fundamental property, maybe it could exist as an emergent one. Emergent properties are things that don’t exist in individual pieces of a system, but do exist for the system as a whole. Each individual water molecule doesn’t have a tide, but the whole ocean does. A movie creates change through time by using a series of still images that appear to have a fluid, continuous change between them. Flipping through the images fast enough, our brains perceive the passage of time from the sequence of still images. No individual frame of the movie changes or contains the passage of time, but it’s a property that comes out of how the pieces are strung together. The movement is real, yet also an illusion. Could the physics of time somehow be a similar illusion? Physicists are still exploring these and other questions, so we’re far from a complete explanation. At least for the moment.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not directly ask about the concept that measures the behavior of the smallest particles in our universe, it does mention "quantum physics" as part of the correct option B, which is "To reconcile general relativity and quantum physics into one fundamental 'theory of everything'". 

However, a closer examination reveals that Question 2 and Question 7 mention specific scientific concepts (entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics), but not the concept of quantum physics as a standalone option.

Among the provided generated MCQs, none directly asks about the concept that measures the behavior of the smallest particles in our universe. However, if I had to choose the most similar one based on the content, I would choose Question 5, as it at least mentions quantum physics.

But since it's not a direct match, I'll provide an alternative approach.

Let's consider the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is to identify the concept that measures the behavior of the smallest particles in our universe. In that case, I can suggest creating a new MCQ that directly asks about this concept.

However, if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match, but with a caveat that it's not a direct match.

- [Instructor] You may have heard from your second grade teacher
that if you swallow gum, it could stay in your stomach forever or worse, it could grow into
a rubber tree in your stomach. Well, that's true, so don't do it. (peppy instrumental music) Okay, maybe not. Swallowing chewing gum isn't
really gonna plant trees in your stomach, but that's no reason to start doing it regularly. Here's what happens to your
body when you swallow gum. When you eat standard food,
three processes go to work in your body to turn that food into fuel. The first is obvious, it's chewing. The process breaks food down into smaller and smaller pieces, increasing the surface area. Meanwhile, saliva coats those
pieces, delivering enzymes that help break down the food. Finally, once swallowed, the stomach acids turn any
remaining food pieces into mush. This lets the food pass through the rest of your digestive track smoothly, but gum doesn't play by those rules. As much as you chew it, gum doesn't break into smaller pieces. That's because it's gum, duh! Gum has been around much
longer than you think. Ancient Mayans and Aztecs harvested resin from a sapodilla tree. They would dry it into a chaw and chew it to stave off hunger. Even back then, it was also recognized as a breath freshener. However, most gum today
is made from natural or synthetic polymers,
most commonly butyl rubber. It's used in all kinds of products, including adhesives, fiber
optics, sealants, cling film, paper, fuel, explosives,
sporting equipment, roofing, bottle stoppers, and tires. But don't worry, the butyl in
your gum won't make you sick. That's because it can't be broken down. The wad of chewing gum
hits your stomach intact. Your saliva enzymes and your stomach acid can't touch the butyl in the gum base, but that doesn't mean it just hangs out. Your body is equipped to handle
gum the same way it deals with other food that
it can't fully digest, like corn and sunflower seeds. (peppy instrumental music) The muscles of your
digestive tract move it along and eventually flush it out of
your system in a day or two, along with everything else. So, no, the gum doesn't stay in your body when you swallow it, but that's no reason to start
gulping it down by the pack. The more gum your body has to process, the higher likelihood
that it will build up. This gum mass can potentially
clog your digestive tract, causing an intestinal blockage which can trigger stomach
pain or constipation. There's a lovely name for
this blockage, a bezoar. An 18-year-old Israeli woman once suffered from a bezoar that blocked her stomach. The problem? Turns out she had been
swallowing at least five pieces of gum every day. The blockage had grown so large
that doctors had to break it into smaller pieces and then fish it out
of her piece by piece. But chewing gum alone isn't
necessarily bad for you. A couple of small studies
have shown that the act of chewing gum can
actually help relax you, because it can help
reduce levels of cortisol, a common stress hormone, in your saliva. Feel free to unwrap a stick. You won't be alone, 56%
of Americans chew gum, each about 280 sticks per year. It's a two billion dollar
industry in the U.S., but be wary of swallowing
it once you're done. The occasional piece of gum won't hurt, but with everything else your
body already does for you, why put it through the extra work? Also, don't spit it out on the ground. That's just gross. Find a trashcan, like a normal person.

**Transcript**:
- [Instructor] You may have heard from your second grade teacher
that if you swallow gum, it could stay in your stomach forever or worse, it could grow into
a rubber tree in your stomach. Well, that's true, so don't do it. (peppy instrumental music) Okay, maybe not. Swallowing chewing gum isn't
really gonna plant trees in your stomach, but that's no reason to start doing it regularly. Here's what happens to your
body when you swallow gum. When you eat standard food,
three processes go to work in your body to turn that food into fuel. The first is obvious, it's chewing. The process breaks food down into smaller and smaller pieces, increasing the surface area. Meanwhile, saliva coats those
pieces, delivering enzymes that help break down the food. Finally, once swallowed, the stomach acids turn any
remaining food pieces into mush. This lets the food pass through the rest of your digestive track smoothly, but gum doesn't play by those rules. As much as you chew it, gum doesn't break into smaller pieces. That's because it's gum, duh! Gum has been around much
longer than you think. Ancient Mayans and Aztecs harvested resin from a sapodilla tree. They would dry it into a chaw and chew it to stave off hunger. Even back then, it was also recognized as a breath freshener. However, most gum today
is made from natural or synthetic polymers,
most commonly butyl rubber. It's used in all kinds of products, including adhesives, fiber
optics, sealants, cling film, paper, fuel, explosives,
sporting equipment, roofing, bottle stoppers, and tires. But don't worry, the butyl in
your gum won't make you sick. That's because it can't be broken down. The wad of chewing gum
hits your stomach intact. Your saliva enzymes and your stomach acid can't touch the butyl in the gum base, but that doesn't mean it just hangs out. Your body is equipped to handle
gum the same way it deals with other food that
it can't fully digest, like corn and sunflower seeds. (peppy instrumental music) The muscles of your
digestive tract move it along and eventually flush it out of
your system in a day or two, along with everything else. So, no, the gum doesn't stay in your body when you swallow it, but that's no reason to start
gulping it down by the pack. The more gum your body has to process, the higher likelihood
that it will build up. This gum mass can potentially
clog your digestive tract, causing an intestinal blockage which can trigger stomach
pain or constipation. There's a lovely name for
this blockage, a bezoar. An 18-year-old Israeli woman once suffered from a bezoar that blocked her stomach. The problem? Turns out she had been
swallowing at least five pieces of gum every day. The blockage had grown so large
that doctors had to break it into smaller pieces and then fish it out
of her piece by piece. But chewing gum alone isn't
necessarily bad for you. A couple of small studies
have shown that the act of chewing gum can
actually help relax you, because it can help
reduce levels of cortisol, a common stress hormone, in your saliva. Feel free to unwrap a stick. You won't be alone, 56%
of Americans chew gum, each about 280 sticks per year. It's a two billion dollar
industry in the U.S., but be wary of swallowing
it once you're done. The occasional piece of gum won't hurt, but with everything else your
body already does for you, why put it through the extra work? Also, don't spit it out on the ground. That's just gross. Find a trashcan, like a normal person.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although Question 8 does not mention specific foods that the body does not digest, its content and intent are similar to the ground truth MCQ. Question 8 mentions that the body handles gum that it can't fully digest by moving it along and eventually flushing it out of the system, which is similar to how the body handles other foods that it can't fully digest, such as corn and sunflower seeds mentioned in the transcript.

However, a more specific match would be beneficial. If there were a generated MCQ that directly asked about other foods that the body does not digest, it would be a more suitable match.

Given the current options, Question 8 is the closest match, but it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Alexios Komnenos, Byzantine emperor, led his army to meet the Scythian hordes in battle. For good luck, he carried one of the holiest relics in Christendom: the veil that had belonged to the Virgin Mary. Unfortunately, it didn’t help. Not only was his army defeated, but as they fled, the Emperor was stabbed in the buttocks. To make matters worse, a strong wind made the relic too heavy to carry, so he stashed it in some bushes as he escaped. But even as he fled, he managed to slay some Scythians and rescue a few comrades. At least, this is how Alexios' daughter Anna recounted the story, writing nearly 60 years later. She spent the last decade of her long life creating a 500-page history of her father’s reign called The Alexiad. Written in Greek, the book was modeled after ancient Greek epics and historical writings. But Anna had a different, trickier task than the writers in these traditions: as a princess writing about her own family, she had to balance her loyalty to her kin with her obligation to portray events accurately, navigating issues like Alexios’s embarrassing stab to the buttocks. A lifetime of study and participation in her father’s government prepared Anna for this undertaking. Anna was born in 1083, shortly after her father seized control of the Roman Empire following a decade of brutal civil wars and revolts. The empire was deep in decline when he came to power, and threatened from all sides: by the Seljuk Turks in the East, the Normans in the West, and Scythian raiders to the north. Over the course of Anna’s childhood and adolescence, Alexios fought constant military campaigns to secure the frontiers of his empire, even striking up an uneasy alliance with the Crusaders. Meanwhile in Constantinople, Anna fought her own battle. She was expected to study subjects considered proper for a Byzantine princess, like courtly etiquette and the Bible, but preferred classical myth and philosophy. To access this material, she had to learn to read and speak Ancient Greek, by studying secretly at night. Eventually her parents realized how serious she was, and provided her with tutors. Anna expanded her studies to classical literature, rhetoric, history, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. One scholar even complained that her constant requests for more Aristotle commentaries were wearing out his eyes. At age fifteen, Anna married Nikephoros Bryennios to quell old conflicts between their families and strengthen Alexios’s reign. Fortunately, Anna and Nikephoros ended up sharing many intellectual interests, hosting and debating the leading scholars of the day. Meanwhile, Alexios’s military excursions began to pay off, restoring many of the empire’s former territories. As her father aged, Anna and her husband helped her parents with their imperial duties. During this time, Anna reportedly advocated for just treatment of the people in their disputes with the government. After Alexios’s death, Anna’s brother John ascended to the throne and Anna turned back to philosophy and scholarship. Her husband had written a history arguing that his grandfather would have made a better emperor than Alexios, but Anna disagreed. She began working on the Alexiad, which made the case for her father's merits as emperor. Spanning the late 11th and early 12th centuries of Byzantine history, the Alexiad recounts the tumultuous events of Alexios’s reign, and Anna’s own reactions to those events, like bursting into tears at the thought of the deaths of her parents and husband. She may have included 
these emotional passages in hopes that they would make her writing more palatable to a society that believed women shouldn't write about battles and empires. While her loyalty to her father was evident in her favorable account of his reign, she also included criticism and her opinions of events. In the centuries after her death, Anna’s Alexiad was copied over and over, and remains an invaluable eyewitness account of Alexios’s reign today. And through her epic historical narrative, Anna Komnene secured her own place in history.

**Transcript**:
Alexios Komnenos, Byzantine emperor, led his army to meet the Scythian hordes in battle. For good luck, he carried one of the holiest relics in Christendom: the veil that had belonged to the Virgin Mary. Unfortunately, it didn’t help. Not only was his army defeated, but as they fled, the Emperor was stabbed in the buttocks. To make matters worse, a strong wind made the relic too heavy to carry, so he stashed it in some bushes as he escaped. But even as he fled, he managed to slay some Scythians and rescue a few comrades. At least, this is how Alexios' daughter Anna recounted the story, writing nearly 60 years later. She spent the last decade of her long life creating a 500-page history of her father’s reign called The Alexiad. Written in Greek, the book was modeled after ancient Greek epics and historical writings. But Anna had a different, trickier task than the writers in these traditions: as a princess writing about her own family, she had to balance her loyalty to her kin with her obligation to portray events accurately, navigating issues like Alexios’s embarrassing stab to the buttocks. A lifetime of study and participation in her father’s government prepared Anna for this undertaking. Anna was born in 1083, shortly after her father seized control of the Roman Empire following a decade of brutal civil wars and revolts. The empire was deep in decline when he came to power, and threatened from all sides: by the Seljuk Turks in the East, the Normans in the West, and Scythian raiders to the north. Over the course of Anna’s childhood and adolescence, Alexios fought constant military campaigns to secure the frontiers of his empire, even striking up an uneasy alliance with the Crusaders. Meanwhile in Constantinople, Anna fought her own battle. She was expected to study subjects considered proper for a Byzantine princess, like courtly etiquette and the Bible, but preferred classical myth and philosophy. To access this material, she had to learn to read and speak Ancient Greek, by studying secretly at night. Eventually her parents realized how serious she was, and provided her with tutors. Anna expanded her studies to classical literature, rhetoric, history, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. One scholar even complained that her constant requests for more Aristotle commentaries were wearing out his eyes. At age fifteen, Anna married Nikephoros Bryennios to quell old conflicts between their families and strengthen Alexios’s reign. Fortunately, Anna and Nikephoros ended up sharing many intellectual interests, hosting and debating the leading scholars of the day. Meanwhile, Alexios’s military excursions began to pay off, restoring many of the empire’s former territories. As her father aged, Anna and her husband helped her parents with their imperial duties. During this time, Anna reportedly advocated for just treatment of the people in their disputes with the government. After Alexios’s death, Anna’s brother John ascended to the throne and Anna turned back to philosophy and scholarship. Her husband had written a history arguing that his grandfather would have made a better emperor than Alexios, but Anna disagreed. She began working on the Alexiad, which made the case for her father's merits as emperor. Spanning the late 11th and early 12th centuries of Byzantine history, the Alexiad recounts the tumultuous events of Alexios’s reign, and Anna’s own reactions to those events, like bursting into tears at the thought of the deaths of her parents and husband. She may have included 
these emotional passages in hopes that they would make her writing more palatable to a society that believed women shouldn't write about battles and empires. While her loyalty to her father was evident in her favorable account of his reign, she also included criticism and her opinions of events. In the centuries after her death, Anna’s Alexiad was copied over and over, and remains an invaluable eyewitness account of Alexios’s reign today. And through her epic historical narrative, Anna Komnene secured her own place in history.

**Transcript**:
A shabby man named Estragon, sits near a tree at dusk and struggles to remove his boot. He’s soon joined by his friend Vladimir, who reminds his anxious companion that they must wait here for someone called Godot. So begins a vexing cycle in which the two debate when Godot will come, why they’re waiting, and whether they’re even at the right tree. From here, Waiting for Godot only gets stranger - but it’s considered a play that changed the face of modern drama. Written by Samuel Beckett between 1949 and 1955, it offers a simple but stirring question - what should the characters do? Estragon: Don’t let's do anything. It's safer. Vladimir: Let’s wait and see what he says. Estragon: Who? Vladimir: Godot. Estragon: Good idea. Such cryptic dialogue and circular reasoning are key features of the Theatre of the Absurd, a movement which emerged after the Second World War and found artists struggling to find meaning in devastation. The absurdists deconstructed plot, character and language to question their meaning and share their profound uncertainty on stage. While this may sound grim, the absurd blends its hopelessness with humor. This is reflected in Beckett’s unique approach to genre in Waiting for Godot, which he branded “a tragicomedy in two acts." Tragically, the characters are locked in an existential conundrum: they wait in vain for an unknown figure to give them a sense of purpose, but their only sense of purpose comes from the act of waiting, While they wait, they sink into boredom, express religious dread and contemplate suicide. But comically, there is a jagged humor to their predicament, which comes across in their language and movements. Their interactions are filled with bizarre wordplay, repetition and double entendres, as well as physical clowning, singing and dancing, and frantically swapping their hats. It’s often unclear whether the audience is supposed to laugh or cry - or whether Beckett saw any difference between the two. Born in Dublin, Beckett studied English, French and Italian before moving to Paris, where he spent most of his life writing theatre, poetry and prose. While Beckett had a lifelong love of language, he also made space for silence by incorporating gaps, pauses and moments of emptiness into his work. This was a key feature of his trademark uneven tempo and black humor, which became popular throughout the Theatre of the Absurd. He also cultivated a mysterious persona, and refused to confirm or deny any speculations about the meaning of his work. This kept audiences guessing, increasing their fascination with his surreal worlds and enigmatic characters. The lack of any clear meaning makes Godot endlessly open to interpretation. Critics have offered countless readings of the play, resulting in a cycle of ambiguity and speculation that mirrors the plot of the drama itself. It's been read as an allegory of the Cold War, the French Resistance, and Britain’s colonization of Ireland. The dynamic of the two protagonists has also sparked intense debate. They’ve been read as survivors of the apocalypse, an aging couple, two impotent friends, and even as personifications of Freud’s ego and id. Famously, Beckett said the only thing he could be sure of was that Vladimir and Estragon were "wearing bowler hats." Like the critical speculation and maddening plot, their language often goes in circles as the two bicker and banter, lose their train of thought, and pick up right where they left off: Vladimir: We could start all over again perhaps Estragon: That should be easy Vladimir: It’s the start that’s difficult Estragon: You can start from anything Vladimir: Yes, but you have to decide. Beckett reminds us that just like our daily lives, the world onstage doesn’t always make sense. It can explore both reality and illusion, the familiar and the strange. And although a tidy narrative still appeals, the best theatre keeps us thinking – and waiting.

**Transcript**:
A shabby man named Estragon, sits near a tree at dusk and struggles to remove his boot. He’s soon joined by his friend Vladimir, who reminds his anxious companion that they must wait here for someone called Godot. So begins a vexing cycle in which the two debate when Godot will come, why they’re waiting, and whether they’re even at the right tree. From here, Waiting for Godot only gets stranger - but it’s considered a play that changed the face of modern drama. Written by Samuel Beckett between 1949 and 1955, it offers a simple but stirring question - what should the characters do? Estragon: Don’t let's do anything. It's safer. Vladimir: Let’s wait and see what he says. Estragon: Who? Vladimir: Godot. Estragon: Good idea. Such cryptic dialogue and circular reasoning are key features of the Theatre of the Absurd, a movement which emerged after the Second World War and found artists struggling to find meaning in devastation. The absurdists deconstructed plot, character and language to question their meaning and share their profound uncertainty on stage. While this may sound grim, the absurd blends its hopelessness with humor. This is reflected in Beckett’s unique approach to genre in Waiting for Godot, which he branded “a tragicomedy in two acts." Tragically, the characters are locked in an existential conundrum: they wait in vain for an unknown figure to give them a sense of purpose, but their only sense of purpose comes from the act of waiting, While they wait, they sink into boredom, express religious dread and contemplate suicide. But comically, there is a jagged humor to their predicament, which comes across in their language and movements. Their interactions are filled with bizarre wordplay, repetition and double entendres, as well as physical clowning, singing and dancing, and frantically swapping their hats. It’s often unclear whether the audience is supposed to laugh or cry - or whether Beckett saw any difference between the two. Born in Dublin, Beckett studied English, French and Italian before moving to Paris, where he spent most of his life writing theatre, poetry and prose. While Beckett had a lifelong love of language, he also made space for silence by incorporating gaps, pauses and moments of emptiness into his work. This was a key feature of his trademark uneven tempo and black humor, which became popular throughout the Theatre of the Absurd. He also cultivated a mysterious persona, and refused to confirm or deny any speculations about the meaning of his work. This kept audiences guessing, increasing their fascination with his surreal worlds and enigmatic characters. The lack of any clear meaning makes Godot endlessly open to interpretation. Critics have offered countless readings of the play, resulting in a cycle of ambiguity and speculation that mirrors the plot of the drama itself. It's been read as an allegory of the Cold War, the French Resistance, and Britain’s colonization of Ireland. The dynamic of the two protagonists has also sparked intense debate. They’ve been read as survivors of the apocalypse, an aging couple, two impotent friends, and even as personifications of Freud’s ego and id. Famously, Beckett said the only thing he could be sure of was that Vladimir and Estragon were "wearing bowler hats." Like the critical speculation and maddening plot, their language often goes in circles as the two bicker and banter, lose their train of thought, and pick up right where they left off: Vladimir: We could start all over again perhaps Estragon: That should be easy Vladimir: It’s the start that’s difficult Estragon: You can start from anything Vladimir: Yes, but you have to decide. Beckett reminds us that just like our daily lives, the world onstage doesn’t always make sense. It can explore both reality and illusion, the familiar and the strange. And although a tidy narrative still appeals, the best theatre keeps us thinking – and waiting.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that includes options related to physical clowning, cryptic dialogue, and jagged humor.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that includes all these elements. Unfortunately, no such question exists among the provided generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose:

**Question 3: What is the unique approach to genre in "Waiting for Godot"? Options: A. Tragedy, B. Comedy, C. Tragicomedy, D. Melodrama Correct Option: C**

This question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, but it does relate to the concept of tragicomedy, which is mentioned in the transcript as a genre that blends hopelessness with humor.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would choose **Question 3** as the most similar generated MCQ, but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I would recommend Question 6 as the closest match.

Question 6 asks about the significance of the title character, Godot, and option D states that Godot is a non-existent character who represents the characters' own sense of purpose. This is related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks if Samuel Beckett stated that Waiting for Godot was an allegory. Although the questions are not identical, they both touch on the idea of Godot's meaning and symbolism in the play.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, I would suggest that a new question be generated that explicitly asks about Beckett's statements on the play's meaning or allegory.

That being said, if I had to choose from the existing options, I would recommend:

**Transcript**:
The annals of Ancient Egyptian king 
Thutmose III described a marvelous foreign bird that “gives birth daily.” Zoroastrians viewed them as spirits whose cries told of the cosmic struggle between darkness and light. Romans brought them on
their military campaigns to foretell the success of future battles. And today, this bird still occupies
an important, though much less honorable position – on our dinner plates. The modern chicken is descended
primarily from the Red Junglefowl, and partially from three other 
closely related species, all native to India and Southeast Asia. The region’s bamboo plants produce massive amounts of fruit just once every few decades. Junglefowls’ ability to lay eggs daily may have evolved to take advantage 
of these rare feasts, increasing their population
when food was abundant. This was something humans could exploit on a consistent basis, and the birds’ weak flight capabilities and limited need for space made them easy to capture and contain. The earliest domesticated chickens, dating at least back to 7,000 years ago, weren’t bred for food, but for something considered
less savory today. The aggressiveness of breeding males, armed with natural leg spurs, made cockfighting a popular entertainment. By the second millennium BCE, chickens had spread from the 
Indus Valley to China and the Middle East to occupy
royal menageries and to be used in religious rituals. But it was in Egypt where the next chapter in
the bird’s history began. When a hen naturally incubates eggs, she will stop laying new ones and sit on a “clutch” of 6
or more eggs for 21 days. By the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, the Egyptians had learned to artificially incubate chicken eggs by placing them in baskets over hot ashes. That freed up hens to continue
laying daily, and what had been a royal delicacy or religious offering became a common meal. Around the same time as Egyptians
were incubating eggs, Phoenician merchants introduced
chickens to Europe, where they quickly became
an essential part of European livestock. However, for a long time, the chicken’s revered status 
continued to exist alongside its culinary one. The Ancient Greeks used fighting roosters as inspirational examples 
for young soldiers. The Romans consulted chickens as oracles. And as late as the 7th Century, the chicken was considered
a symbol for Christianity. Over the next few centuries, chickens accompanied humans
wherever they went, spreading throughout the world
through trade, conquest, and colonization. After the Opium Wars, Chinese breeds were brought to England and crossed with local chickens. This gave rise to a phenomenon called “Hen Fever” or “The Fancy”, with farmers all over Europe striving to breed new varieties with particular combinations of traits. This trend also caught the attention of a certain Charles Darwin,
who wondered if a similar selective breeding process
occurred in nature. Darwin would observe hundreds of chickens while finalizing his historic work introducing the theory of Evolution. But the chicken’s greatest
contribution to science was yet to come. In the early 20th century, a trio of British scientists conducted extensive crossbreeding
of chickens, building on Gregor Mendel’s studies of genetic inheritance. With their high genetic diversity, many distinct traits, and only 7 months between generations, chickens were the perfect subject. This work resulted in the famous
Punnett Square, used to show the genotypes
that would result from breeding a given pairing. Since then, numerous breeding initiatives
have made chickens bigger and meatier, and allowed them to lay 
more eggs than ever. Meanwhile, chicken production has shifted 
to an industrial, factory-like model, with birds raised in spaces 
with a footprint no larger than a sheet of paper. And while there’s been a shift
towards free-range farming due to animal rights 
and environmental concerns, most of the world’s more than
22 billion chickens today are factory farmed. From gladiators and gifts to the gods, to traveling companions 
and research subjects, chickens have played many roles
over the centuries. And though they may not have come 
before the proverbial egg, chickens’ fascinating history tells us 
a great deal about our own.

This gave rise to a phenomenon called “Hen Fever” or “The Fancy”, with farmers all over Europe striving to breed new varieties with particular combinations of traits. This trend also caught the attention of a certain Charles Darwin,
who wondered if a similar selective breeding process
occurred in nature. Darwin would observe hundreds of chickens while finalizing his historic work introducing the theory of Evolution. But the chicken’s greatest
contribution to science was yet to come. In the early 20th century, a trio of British scientists conducted extensive crossbreeding
of chickens, building on Gregor Mendel’s studies of genetic inheritance. With their high genetic diversity, many distinct traits, and only 7 months between generations, chickens were the perfect subject. This work resulted in the famous
Punnett Square, used to show the genotypes
that would result from breeding a given pairing. Since then, numerous breeding initiatives
have made chickens bigger and meatier, and allowed them to lay 
more eggs than ever. Meanwhile, chicken production has shifted 
to an industrial, factory-like model, with birds raised in spaces 
with a footprint no larger than a sheet of paper. And while there’s been a shift
towards free-range farming due to animal rights 
and environmental concerns, most of the world’s more than
22 billion chickens today are factory farmed. From gladiators and gifts to the gods, to traveling companions 
and research subjects, chickens have played many roles
over the centuries. And though they may not have come 
before the proverbial egg, chickens’ fascinating history tells us 
a great deal about our own.

**Transcript**:
Mounting his skinny steed, the protagonist of Don Quixote charges an army of giants. In his eyes, it is his duty to vanquish these behemoths in the name of his beloved lady, Dulcinea. However, this act of valor is ill conceived. As his squire Sancho Panza explains to him time and again, these aren’t giants; they are merely windmills. Don Quixote is undeterred, but his piercing lance is soon caught in their sails. Never discouraged, the knight stands proudly, and becomes even more convinced of his mission. This sequence encapsulates much of what is loved about Don Quixote, the epic, illogical, and soulful tale of Alonso Quijano, who becomes the clumsy but valiant Don Quixote of la Mancha, known as the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance. Originally published in two volumes, the narrative follows Don Quixote as he travels through central and northern Spain fighting the forces of evil. Despite Don Quixote’s lofty imagination, his creator, Miguel de Cervantes, could never have imagined his book would become the best-selling novel of all time. Barring 5 years as a soldier, and 5 more enslaved by pirates, Cervantes spent most of his life as a struggling poet and playwright. It wasn’t until his late 50’s that he published his greatest creation: an epic satire of chivalry novels. At this time, medieval books chronicling the adventures of knights and their moral code dominated European culture. While Cervantes was a fan, he was weary of these repetitive tomes, which focused more on listing heroic feats than character development. To challenge them, he wrote Don Quixote, the story of a hidalgo, or idle nobleman, who spends his days and nights reading chivalry novels. Driven mad by these stories, he fashions himself a champion for the downtrodden. Everyone in his village tries to convince him to give up his lunacy, going so far as to burn some of the lurid books in his personal library. But Don Quixote is unstoppable. He dresses up in old shining armor, mounts his skinny horse, and leaves his village in search of glory. Cervantes’ novel unfolds as a collection of episodes detailing the mishaps of the valiant knight. Yet unlike the chivalry books and perhaps all other prior fiction, Cervantes’ story deeply investigates the protagonist’s inner life. Don Quixote matures as the narrative develops, undergoing a noticeable transformation. This literary revelation has led many scholars to call Don Quixote the first modern novel. And this character development doesn’t happen in isolation. Early on, Don Quixote is joined by a villager-turned-squire named Sancho Panza. Sancho and Don Quixote are a study in opposites: with one as the grounded realist to the other’s idealism. Their lively, evolving friendship is often credited as the original hero and sidekick duo, inspiring centuries of fictional partnerships. Don Quixote was a huge success. Numerous editions were published across Europe in the seventeenth century. Even in the Americas, where the Church banned all novels for being sinful distractions, audiences were known to enjoy pirated editions. The book was so well received that readers clamored for more. After a rival author attempted to cash in on a fake follow-up, Cervantes released the official sequel in response. Now published alongside the first volume as a completed text, this second volume picks up where the original left off, only now Don Quixote and Sancho have become folk heroes. Just as in real-life, Cervantes included his novel’s success in the world of his characters. This unconventional meta-awareness created philosophical complexity, as the knight and his squire ponder the meaning of their story. Unfortunately, Cervantes had sold the book’s publishing rights for very little. He died rich in fame alone. But his treatise on the power of creativity and individualism has inspired art, literature, popular culture, and even political revolution. Don Quixote argues that our imagination greatly informs our actions, making us capable of change, and, indeed, making us human.

**Transcript**:
Mounting his skinny steed, the protagonist of Don Quixote charges an army of giants. In his eyes, it is his duty to vanquish these behemoths in the name of his beloved lady, Dulcinea. However, this act of valor is ill conceived. As his squire Sancho Panza explains to him time and again, these aren’t giants; they are merely windmills. Don Quixote is undeterred, but his piercing lance is soon caught in their sails. Never discouraged, the knight stands proudly, and becomes even more convinced of his mission. This sequence encapsulates much of what is loved about Don Quixote, the epic, illogical, and soulful tale of Alonso Quijano, who becomes the clumsy but valiant Don Quixote of la Mancha, known as the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance. Originally published in two volumes, the narrative follows Don Quixote as he travels through central and northern Spain fighting the forces of evil. Despite Don Quixote’s lofty imagination, his creator, Miguel de Cervantes, could never have imagined his book would become the best-selling novel of all time. Barring 5 years as a soldier, and 5 more enslaved by pirates, Cervantes spent most of his life as a struggling poet and playwright. It wasn’t until his late 50’s that he published his greatest creation: an epic satire of chivalry novels. At this time, medieval books chronicling the adventures of knights and their moral code dominated European culture. While Cervantes was a fan, he was weary of these repetitive tomes, which focused more on listing heroic feats than character development. To challenge them, he wrote Don Quixote, the story of a hidalgo, or idle nobleman, who spends his days and nights reading chivalry novels. Driven mad by these stories, he fashions himself a champion for the downtrodden. Everyone in his village tries to convince him to give up his lunacy, going so far as to burn some of the lurid books in his personal library. But Don Quixote is unstoppable. He dresses up in old shining armor, mounts his skinny horse, and leaves his village in search of glory. Cervantes’ novel unfolds as a collection of episodes detailing the mishaps of the valiant knight. Yet unlike the chivalry books and perhaps all other prior fiction, Cervantes’ story deeply investigates the protagonist’s inner life. Don Quixote matures as the narrative develops, undergoing a noticeable transformation. This literary revelation has led many scholars to call Don Quixote the first modern novel. And this character development doesn’t happen in isolation. Early on, Don Quixote is joined by a villager-turned-squire named Sancho Panza. Sancho and Don Quixote are a study in opposites: with one as the grounded realist to the other’s idealism. Their lively, evolving friendship is often credited as the original hero and sidekick duo, inspiring centuries of fictional partnerships. Don Quixote was a huge success. Numerous editions were published across Europe in the seventeenth century. Even in the Americas, where the Church banned all novels for being sinful distractions, audiences were known to enjoy pirated editions. The book was so well received that readers clamored for more. After a rival author attempted to cash in on a fake follow-up, Cervantes released the official sequel in response. Now published alongside the first volume as a completed text, this second volume picks up where the original left off, only now Don Quixote and Sancho have become folk heroes. Just as in real-life, Cervantes included his novel’s success in the world of his characters. This unconventional meta-awareness created philosophical complexity, as the knight and his squire ponder the meaning of their story. Unfortunately, Cervantes had sold the book’s publishing rights for very little. He died rich in fame alone. But his treatise on the power of creativity and individualism has inspired art, literature, popular culture, and even political revolution. Don Quixote argues that our imagination greatly informs our actions, making us capable of change, and, indeed, making us human.

Why does every keyboard look like this? OK, so this top strip here, there is a 99% chance that on your keyboard it's:  We all have these QWERTY keyboards. There’s probably even one in your pocket, on a screen. But why? Why is this pattern of letters so familiar? “This of course, is the keyboard.” But why, "of course?" QWERTY was just one person’s invention from the 1870s. It’s almost 140 years old,  yet, it's still the standard. “All of these machines are alike in many respects.” We all use it, but don’t know why.  That’s the definition of overrated! And it turns out that this little keyboard is the subject of intense debate, some lies you’ve probably been told before, and a few real explanations that might surprise you.  Including an old fashioned cartel. Lots of people have tried to arrange these jumbled letters. There was a half century period of indecision. Debate. In the 1840's, Hughes Printing Telegraph arranged 
the keys like a piano keyboard. Or, look at the Hansen’s Writing Ball from 1865. People’s fingers pecked at this thing. The letters varied per version, but they showed up in this pattern. This 1868 typewriter looks weird too, 
but it was the start of something. The inventor, was Christopher Latham Sholes. He looked like typewriter Santa Claus,
and he kept going. In 1870, he developed a pattern like this. As of 1873, he’d come up with a keyboard that 
looked a lot like QWERTY. But there were quirks. Notice that period where the R should be. And the A and Z are flipped. The M 
also sits next to the L. Remington, a company that made machines for shooting and sewing, bought the design. Suddenly, they were in the typewriter business. The design Sholes patented in 1878 was basically QWERTY. Along with the numbers, the only weirdness is that M next to the L, and the C and X are flipped compared to a
contemporary keyboard. The company that made Remington Typewriters was soon sending out 
sales packets with the QWERTY we know and love. But that doesn’t quite explain how QWERTY got big. There are urban legends. One’s that QWERTY was designed that way to keep typewriter keys from jamming. But lots of designs could do that, and there’s not a lot of good evidence that 
that's why QWERTY was designed. Other options were even still around in 1890, like the Merritt Typewriter. You moved this handle to the right spot
for your letter and pressed down. The letters weren’t in QWERTY, they were in a big long strip that looked like this. So it was  a KWBHGP keyboard. Many typists believed it worked as well as QWERTY. But the best evidence of all that
QWERTY wasn’t “the perfect design,” might be this invention from 1889. The keyboard? Not QWERTY, but XPMCHR. The inventor? Christopher Latham Sholes, the guy who invented QWERTY. He created it just before he died. Even the creator of QWERTY wasn’t settled on QWERTY! And that’s where the cartel comes in. Look at this king. He has something to do with QWERTY. See the label on his crown?  "Trusts." In the 1890s, many companies merged into trusts that allowed 
them to fix prices and control markets. In 1893, that happened with typewriters, when some of the biggest manufacturers came
together to form Union Typewriter Company. Manufacturers cared most about price and technical improvements, like how the typewriter worked. But there was another effect of the trust. The biggest company made Remington Typewriters, and they used Sholes’ QWERTY keyboard design. The trust did the same. Most experts think the trust didn’t work to fix prices. It had trouble beating innovative competitors. But their market power did fix a pattern on the keyboard. And there’s one more reason why that pattern stuck. Look at these old typewriter ads. Or these early typists. Now you might notice that most of these students are women. That is worth noting! But for the story of QWERTY, it’s more important 
to notice that they’re in a class, together. Typing wasn’t like it is today, where you get one of these at the office, or one of these when you’re born. Typists trained. They took classes. If you took a class, you took it for the most common keyboard. That was QWERTY. People still debate whether QWERTY’s the best. Some say the 1930s DVORAK keyboard is better, others say it too is overrated. Whether it’s the best system or not, QWERTY isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. “How you type is more important than what you type.” “This is the mark of a good typist.” There are so many other unprovable theories 
when it comes to QWERTY. One of my favorites is that the 
keyboard was arranged that way so that sales people could peck out TYPEWRITER 
all on the top of the keyboard.

**Transcript**:
The good news is that your experimental robo-ants are a success! The bad news is that you accidentally just gave them the ability to shoot deadly lasers …and you can’t turn it off. You have five minutes to stop them before the lasers go online. Until then, all of your robo-ants will walk inside their habitat at a speed of exactly 1 meter per minute. If they bump into each other or hit a dead end, they’ll instantly turn around and walk back the way they came. When five minutes are up, they’ll turn on their lasers, break free, and stream out into the world, carving a path of destruction as they go. Your one chance to stop them is to insert the two emergency vacuum nozzles into the habitat and suck the ants up before they break free. The nozzles can press into any one location in the habitat through a membrane covering its front side, and any ants that walk past will be sucked up and deactivated. You can’t move the nozzles once they’re placed without leaving a hole that the robo-ants would pour out of, so choosing the right spots will be key. The habitat is made out of meter-long tubes. When the robots reach an intersection, they will pick randomly whether to go left, right, or forward. They only go backward if they hit hit another robo-ant or a dead end. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of them inside the habitat, and if even one escapes, it’ll do a lot of damage. With just less than five minutes remaining, where should you place the 2 vacuum nozzles to suck up all the robo-ants? Pause the video now if
you want to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 With robo-ants ricocheting all over the habitat, it might seem impossible to stop them before they break free. But this situation is simpler than it seems. Here's why. Imagine just two robo-ants crawling toward each other. When they collide, they immediately reverse directions. And what would that sequence of events look like if they crawled past each other instead? It would look exactly the same before and after their collision, but with their positions swapped. This is true every time a pair of robo-ants meet. Because the identities of individual ants don’t matter, you just need to figure out where you should put the nozzles to capture any single ant walking without interruption for less than 5 minutes, starting from any point in the habitat. That’s much easier to conceptualize and solve. Placing the nozzles at intersections where three or four tubes meet seems like your best bet since that’s where the robo-ants might otherwise change directions and miss your nozzles. There are only four intersections… which two should you pick? The top right intersection has to be one of them. If it isn’t, an ant crawling down from this intersection toward the dead end would crawl for four minutes to get back to the intersection, and then go in any of three directions, walking for at least another minute. Once you’ve placed a nozzle in the top right, the only other choice that has a chance to work is the bottom left. To see that this works, imagine an ant anywhere else in the habitat. Worst case scenario, the ant would start right next to the vacuum nozzle, marching away from it. But in all those worst cases, the ant would march for at most 4 meters before being sucked up into the vacuum. No other choice of two intersection points is guaranteed to get all the robo-ants within five minutes. Having vacuumed them all up, you’ve averted a major crisis. Before you mess with robo-ants again, you’ll want to have a robo-anteater ready. And wouldn’t it be cool if it could fly and breathe fire? There’s no way that could go wrong!

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How fast do the robo-ants crawl?
Options: A. 1 meter per second, B. 1 meter per minute, C. 1 meter per hour, D. 50 meters per hour
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQs**:
Question 1: How long will the robo-ants behave when they reach an intersection in the habitat? Options: A. They will randomly choose to go left, right, or forward., B. They will only go backward if they hit another robo-ant or a dead end., C. They will always go forward and never change direction., D. They will only go left if they hit another robo-ant or a dead end. Correct Option: A

Question 3: What is the main challenge in stopping the robo-ants from breaking free? Options: A. There are too many robo-ants in the habitat., B. The robo-ants are moving too fast., C. The robo-ants can only be stopped by placing the vacuum nozzles in specific locations., D. The robo-ants are too big to fit through the habitat. Correct Option: C
Question 4: How can the problem of stopping the robo-ants be simplified? Options: A. By considering the individual identities of each robo-ant., B.

Question 9: What is the only other choice that has a chance to work after placing a nozzle in the top right intersection? Options: A. The bottom right intersection., B. The top left intersection., C. The bottom left intersection., D. The middle intersection. Correct Option: C
Question 10: What is the consequence of not stopping the robo-ants before they break free? Options: A. They will be deactivated and unable to move., B. They will be captured and taken away., C. They will cause a lot of damage to the habitat and surrounding area., D. They will change direction and move in a different direction. Correct Option: C

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the speed of the robo-ants, which is a specific detail mentioned in the transcript. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask about the speed of the robo-ants directly.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one that is vaguely related to the movement of the robo-ants, I would say Question 2 is the closest, but it's still not similar.

A more accurate answer would be "None of the above" or "No match found".

**Transcript**:
The good news is that your experimental robo-ants are a success! The bad news is that you accidentally just gave them the ability to shoot deadly lasers …and you can’t turn it off. You have five minutes to stop them before the lasers go online. Until then, all of your robo-ants will walk inside their habitat at a speed of exactly 1 meter per minute. If they bump into each other or hit a dead end, they’ll instantly turn around and walk back the way they came. When five minutes are up, they’ll turn on their lasers, break free, and stream out into the world, carving a path of destruction as they go. Your one chance to stop them is to insert the two emergency vacuum nozzles into the habitat and suck the ants up before they break free. The nozzles can press into any one location in the habitat through a membrane covering its front side, and any ants that walk past will be sucked up and deactivated. You can’t move the nozzles once they’re placed without leaving a hole that the robo-ants would pour out of, so choosing the right spots will be key. The habitat is made out of meter-long tubes. When the robots reach an intersection, they will pick randomly whether to go left, right, or forward. They only go backward if they hit hit another robo-ant or a dead end. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of them inside the habitat, and if even one escapes, it’ll do a lot of damage. With just less than five minutes remaining, where should you place the 2 vacuum nozzles to suck up all the robo-ants? Pause the video now if
you want to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 With robo-ants ricocheting all over the habitat, it might seem impossible to stop them before they break free. But this situation is simpler than it seems. Here's why. Imagine just two robo-ants crawling toward each other. When they collide, they immediately reverse directions. And what would that sequence of events look like if they crawled past each other instead? It would look exactly the same before and after their collision, but with their positions swapped. This is true every time a pair of robo-ants meet. Because the identities of individual ants don’t matter, you just need to figure out where you should put the nozzles to capture any single ant walking without interruption for less than 5 minutes, starting from any point in the habitat. That’s much easier to conceptualize and solve. Placing the nozzles at intersections where three or four tubes meet seems like your best bet since that’s where the robo-ants might otherwise change directions and miss your nozzles. There are only four intersections… which two should you pick? The top right intersection has to be one of them. If it isn’t, an ant crawling down from this intersection toward the dead end would crawl for four minutes to get back to the intersection, and then go in any of three directions, walking for at least another minute. Once you’ve placed a nozzle in the top right, the only other choice that has a chance to work is the bottom left. To see that this works, imagine an ant anywhere else in the habitat. Worst case scenario, the ant would start right next to the vacuum nozzle, marching away from it. But in all those worst cases, the ant would march for at most 4 meters before being sucked up into the vacuum. No other choice of two intersection points is guaranteed to get all the robo-ants within five minutes. Having vacuumed them all up, you’ve averted a major crisis. Before you mess with robo-ants again, you’ll want to have a robo-anteater ready. And wouldn’t it be cool if it could fly and breathe fire? There’s no way that could go wrong!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of vacuum nozzles available. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 8 asks about the number of intersections where the vacuum nozzles can be placed. 

However, a more relevant question could be Question 5, which mentions "the vacuum nozzles" (plural) in the question and the correct answer, implying that there are multiple vacuum nozzles.

But the most similar question is actually Question 8, in terms of question type (asking for a quantity) and relevance to the vacuum nozzles.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 8

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, its intent is closest to the original question. The ground truth MCQ asks about the difference between a situation where the robo-ants collide and a situation where they pass each other. Question 4 asks how the problem of stopping the robo-ants can be simplified, and the correct answer (C) mentions considering the behavior of a single robo-ant and applying it to all others. This is related to the idea presented in the ground truth MCQ, where the situation of robo-ants colliding and passing each other is considered identical except for the ants being in opposite positions.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose, I would say Question 4 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
If we evolved from monkeys,
why are there still monkeys? (Laughter) Well, because we're not monkeys, we're fish. (Laughter) Now, knowing you're a fish
and not a monkey is actually really important
to understanding where we came from. I teach one of the largest
evolutionary biology classes in the US, and when my students finally understand
why I call them fish all the time, then I know I'm getting my job done. But I always have to start my classes
by dispelling some hardwired myths, because without really knowing it,
many of us were taught evolution wrong. For instance, we're taught
to say "the theory of evolution." There are actually many theories,
and just like the process itself, the ones that best fit the data
are the ones that survive to this day. The one we know best
is Darwinian natural selection. That's the process by which organisms
that best fit an environment survive and get to reproduce, while those that are less fit
slowly die off. And that's it. Evolution is as simple as that,
and it's a fact. Evolution is a fact
as much as the "theory of gravity." You can prove it just as easily. You just need to look at your bellybutton that you share
with other placental mammals, or your backbone that you share
with other vertebrates, or your DNA that you share
with all other life on earth. Those traits didn't pop up in humans. They were passed down
from different ancestors to all their descendants, not just us. But that's not really
how we learn biology early on, is it? We learn plants and bacteria
are primitive things, and fish give rise to amphibians
followed by reptiles and mammals, and then you get you, this perfectly evolved creature
at the end of the line. But life doesn't evolve in a line, and it doesn't end with us. But we're always shown evolution
portrayed something like this, a monkey and a chimpanzee, some extinct humans, all on a forward and steady march
to becoming us. But they don't become us
any more than we would become them. We're also not the goal of evolution. But why does it matter? Why do we need to understand
evolution the right way? Well, misunderstanding evolution
has led to many problems, but you can't ask that age-old question, "Where are we from?" without understanding
evolution the right way. Misunderstanding it has led
to many convoluted and corrupted views of how we should treat
other life on earth, and how we should treat each other in terms of race and gender. So let's go back four billion years. This is the single-celled organism
we all came from. At first, it gave rise
to other single-celled life, but these are still evolving to this day, and some would say
the Archaea and Bacteria that make up most of this group is the most successful on the planet. They are certainly going
to be here well after us. About three billion years ago,
multicellularity evolved. This includes your fungi
and your plants and your animals. The first animals to develop
a backbone were fishes. So technically,
all vertebrates are fishes, so technically, you and I are fish. So don't say I didn't warn you. One fish lineage came onto land and gave rise to, among other things,
the mammals and reptiles. Some reptiles become birds,
some mammals become primates, some primates become monkeys with tails, and others become the great apes,
including a variety of human species. So you see, we didn't evolve from monkeys, but we do share
a common ancestor with them. All the while, life
around us kept evolving: more bacteria, more fungi,
lots of fish, fish, fish. If you couldn't tell --
yes, they're my favorite group. (Laughter) As life evolves, it also goes extinct. Most species just last
for a few million years. So you see, most life on earth
that we see around us today are about the same age as our species. So it's hubris,
it's self-centered to think, "Oh, plants and bacteria are primitive, and we've been here
for an evolutionary minute, so we're somehow special." Think of life as being this book,
an unfinished book for sure. We're just seeing the last
few pages of each chapter. If you look out
on the eight million species that we share this planet with, think of them all being
four billion years of evolution. They're all the product of that. Think of us all as young leaves
on this ancient and gigantic tree of life, all of us connected by invisible branches
not just to each other, but to our extinct relatives
and our evolutionary ancestors. As a biologist, I'm still
trying to learn, with others, how everyone's related to each other,
who is related to whom. Perhaps it's better still to think of us
as a little fish out of water. Yes, one that learned to walk and talk, but one that still has
a lot of learning to do about who we are and where we came from. Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

However, the options provided in Question 1 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the first animals to develop a backbone.

Since there isn't a direct match, I will choose the closest one based on the content. According to the transcript, the speaker mentions that "The first animals to develop a backbone were fishes. So technically, all vertebrates are fishes..." 

This information is closely related to Question 1, but a more accurate match would be a question that directly asks about the first animals to develop a backbone.

Given the options, I would choose Question 1 as the closest match, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
In 1987, tens of thousands of people gathered in Saudi Arabia 
for the annual Hajj pilgrimage. But what started out as a celebration 
led to a health crisis: just a few days after the pilgrimage, more than 2,000 cases 
of meningitis broke out spreading across Saudi Arabia
and the rest of the world. The outbreak was so fierce that it was believed to have sparked a
wave of deadly meningitis epidemics that ultimately infected tens of
thousands of people worldwide. Meningitis is the inflammation 
of the meninges, three tissue layers responsible for 
protecting the brain and spinal cord. What makes meningitis so dangerous
compared to other diseases is the sheer speed with which
it invades a person’s body. In the worst cases, it causes death 
within a day. Fortunately, that’s rare for patients
who receive early medical treatment. The disease primarily 
comes in three forms: fungal, viral, and bacterial--
the last being the most deadly by far, and what we’ll focus on. People usually contract bacterial 
meningitis by breathing in tiny particles of mucus and 
saliva that spray into the air when an infected person 
sneezes or coughs. It can also be transmitted 
through kissing, or sharing cigarettes, 
toothbrushes or utensils. Some people can be infected 
and carry the disease without showing symptoms
or getting sick, which helps the disease
spread quickly to others. Once the bacteria enter 
the nose, mouth, and throat, they cross the surrounding 
membranes and enter the bloodstream. From there, bacteria have 
rapid access to the body’s tissues --including a membrane
called the blood-brain barrier. This is made of a tight mesh of cells which
separate blood vessels from the brain, and block everything except
for a specific set of particles, including water molecules and some gases. But in ways that scientists are 
still trying to understand, meningitis bacteria can trick
the barrier into letting them through. Inside the brain, the bacteria swiftly
infect the meninges. This triggers inflammation as the body’s 
immune response kicks into overdrive, bringing on fever
and intense headaches. As swelling in the meninges worsens,
the neck begins to stiffen. Swelling in the brain disrupts its
normal function-- causing symptoms like hearing loss 
and extreme light sensitivity. As pressure increases in the cranium, 
it may also make the person confused-- one of the hallmarks
of the disease. A few hours in, the rapidly multiplying
bacteria start to release toxins, leading to septicemia,
also known as blood poisoning. This breaks down blood vessels, letting blood seep out and form what
starts out looking like a rash, and evolves into big discoloured blots 
beneath the skin. At the same time, these toxins
burn through oxygen in the blood, reducing the amount that gets to 
major organs like the lungs and kidneys. That increases the chance 
of organ shut down --and alongside spreading 
septicemia, threatens death. That all sounds scary, but doctors are so
good at treating meningitis that a visit to the hospital can drastically
reduce an adult’s risk of dying from it. The longer it’s left 
untreated, though, the more likely it will lead
to lasting damage. If declining oxygen levels cause cell
death in extreme parts of the body --like fingers, toes, arms and legs--
the risk of amputation goes up. And if bacterial toxins accumulate
in the brain and trigger cell death, meningitis could also cause long-term
brain damage and memory loss. So fast treatment, or better yet, 
prevention, is critical. That's why most countries have
vaccines that defend against the disease in its deadliest forms. Those are usually given to the people who
are most at risk--like young children, people with weak immune systems, 
or people who gather in large groups where an outbreak of meningitis 
could potentially happen. In addition to those gatherings, meningitis is most common in
a region called the meningitis belt that stretches across Africa, though cases
do happen all over the world. If you’re concerned that you or someone 
you know may have meningitis, get to the doctor as soon as possible; quick action could save your life.

infect the meninges. This triggers inflammation as the body’s 
immune response kicks into overdrive, bringing on fever
and intense headaches. As swelling in the meninges worsens,
the neck begins to stiffen. Swelling in the brain disrupts its
normal function-- causing symptoms like hearing loss 
and extreme light sensitivity. As pressure increases in the cranium, 
it may also make the person confused-- one of the hallmarks
of the disease. A few hours in, the rapidly multiplying
bacteria start to release toxins, leading to septicemia,
also known as blood poisoning. This breaks down blood vessels, letting blood seep out and form what
starts out looking like a rash, and evolves into big discoloured blots 
beneath the skin. At the same time, these toxins
burn through oxygen in the blood, reducing the amount that gets to 
major organs like the lungs and kidneys. That increases the chance 
of organ shut down --and alongside spreading 
septicemia, threatens death. That all sounds scary, but doctors are so
good at treating meningitis that a visit to the hospital can drastically
reduce an adult’s risk of dying from it. The longer it’s left 
untreated, though, the more likely it will lead
to lasting damage. If declining oxygen levels cause cell
death in extreme parts of the body --like fingers, toes, arms and legs--
the risk of amputation goes up. And if bacterial toxins accumulate
in the brain and trigger cell death, meningitis could also cause long-term
brain damage and memory loss. So fast treatment, or better yet, 
prevention, is critical. That's why most countries have
vaccines that defend against the disease in its deadliest forms. Those are usually given to the people who
are most at risk--like young children, people with weak immune systems, 
or people who gather in large groups where an outbreak of meningitis 
could potentially happen. In addition to those gatherings, meningitis is most common in
a region called the meningitis belt that stretches across Africa, though cases
do happen all over the world. If you’re concerned that you or someone 
you know may have meningitis, get to the doctor as soon as possible; quick action could save your life.

**Transcript**:
In 1987, tens of thousands of people gathered in Saudi Arabia 
for the annual Hajj pilgrimage. But what started out as a celebration 
led to a health crisis: just a few days after the pilgrimage, more than 2,000 cases 
of meningitis broke out spreading across Saudi Arabia
and the rest of the world. The outbreak was so fierce that it was believed to have sparked a
wave of deadly meningitis epidemics that ultimately infected tens of
thousands of people worldwide. Meningitis is the inflammation 
of the meninges, three tissue layers responsible for 
protecting the brain and spinal cord. What makes meningitis so dangerous
compared to other diseases is the sheer speed with which
it invades a person’s body. In the worst cases, it causes death 
within a day. Fortunately, that’s rare for patients
who receive early medical treatment. The disease primarily 
comes in three forms: fungal, viral, and bacterial--
the last being the most deadly by far, and what we’ll focus on. People usually contract bacterial 
meningitis by breathing in tiny particles of mucus and 
saliva that spray into the air when an infected person 
sneezes or coughs. It can also be transmitted 
through kissing, or sharing cigarettes, 
toothbrushes or utensils. Some people can be infected 
and carry the disease without showing symptoms
or getting sick, which helps the disease
spread quickly to others. Once the bacteria enter 
the nose, mouth, and throat, they cross the surrounding 
membranes and enter the bloodstream. From there, bacteria have 
rapid access to the body’s tissues --including a membrane
called the blood-brain barrier. This is made of a tight mesh of cells which
separate blood vessels from the brain, and block everything except
for a specific set of particles, including water molecules and some gases. But in ways that scientists are 
still trying to understand, meningitis bacteria can trick
the barrier into letting them through. Inside the brain, the bacteria swiftly

**Transcript**:
[♪ INTRO] The human body is an incredibly complex machine
made up of systems of organs all working together to keep things humming along smoothly. So you’d think that taking anything out
would make the whole thing break down. But of course, lots of people live without
some of their organs. Like, you’re better off without an appendix
if it’s giving you a problem, for example. And you can afford to lose all kinds of more
important organs, too, like a giant chunk of your liver or even an entire lung. Because yeah, your body is a finely tuned
machine — if you don’t mind me saying so — but it also has a bunch of redundancies
that allow it to adapt to some pretty extreme changes. So here are just a few of the bits you can
live without. Number one, the brain. You didn’t think we were gonna go there! Of all of the organs in the human body to
lose, even partially, you would think that the brain would be a total dealbreaker. I mean, it controls or coordinates basically
everything else. But it turns out that sometimes, it’s better
to live with just one hemisphere — half a brain, in other words. Like when people have a kind of epilepsy where
seizures stem from one side of the brain. This can happen with some developmental brain
disorders, or with rare conditions like when one brain hemisphere is abnormally large. One-sided seizures are often difficult to
treat, and they can be debilitating. So sometimes doctors recommend a hemispherectomy:
the removal of some or all of the half of the brain that’s affected. It’s a very rare, extreme operation, obviously,
but when it’s successful, it can result in a relatively normal life. After a hemispherectomy, between 50-90% of
patients become completely seizure free. They do experience some paralysis in the half
of the body normally controlled by the missing brain hemisphere, but most are still able
to walk if they could before the procedure. And the surgery doesn’t usually result in
cognitive deficits, either. Younger patients tend to have fewer side effects
because the remaining healthy hemisphere is still developing, allowing it to compensate
for what’s missing. Still, it’s a difficult procedure with major
risks, so doctors don’t just chop out half of somebody’s brain without carefully weighing
other options. But the idea that you can lose half of your
brain and still be alive at all is pretty incredible. You might even say it’s … mind-blowing. Breathing is another thing that’s kind of
essential for human life, so you would think that losing a lung would cause a lot of problems. But you can get by just fine with just one
lung. Lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, cancer, or tuberculosis can wreck someone’s lung tissues. So in some cases, part of a lung or even the
entire lung will be removed in a surgery called a pneumonectomy. When one lung is removed, the extra space
allows other organs to shift a bit, giving the remaining lung some more room to expand. Studies have shown that in some animals like
dogs and rats, the remaining lung can actually grow new alveoli—the little sacs where gas
exchange happens. It’s thought that children who get a pneumonectomy
might also do this since their lungs are still developing. But in adults, it’s more likely that the
alveoli just stretch and expand a little to move more air through. Ultimately, one lung is able to do about 70-80%
of what two lungs can, and that is usually enough. Depending on age and other health factors,
it might be a bit more difficult to do strenuous activities, but some people who have had this
surgery go on to run marathons, which is more than I can say for me. Your stomach has to be tough enough to mush
around your meals in gastric acid before passing them along to the small intestine. So it’s fairly resilient. But it can still become impaired or diseased
to the point that the patient needs surgery to redirect the digestive tract around their
stomach or to remove part of it. And in some cases, surgeons perform a total
gastrectomy to take out the whole thing and just connect the esophagus directly to
the small intestine. Oddly enough, this doesn’t really affect
the overall process of digestion since most of it occurs in the small intestine anyway. But since there is no stomach to store food
in, patients often need to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Sometimes they also need additional vitamin
supplements for things that aren’t absorbed well by the small intestine, like vitamin
B12 or vitamin D. And some patients might develop a side effect
called dumping syndrome, which, no, does not refer to the ‘dumping’ that you may be
thinking of right now. Sugars and starches are usually digested in
the stomach, but after a gastrectomy, they “dump” straight into the small intestine. Since the intestine isn’t used to that,
it recruits water to help break those things down, and a lot of that water comes from your
blood, causing a drop in blood pressure. With dumping syndrome, that can cause all
kinds of unpleasant symptoms after a meal: cramping and bloating, nausea, weakness, dizziness,
and low blood pressure. But generally, dietary changes are enough
to overcome these issues, and people without a stomach get enough calories to go back to
their lives. The spleen, which sits to the left of the
stomach, is also a pretty useful organ. It’s involved in filtering blood, including
removing and breaking down old red blood cells, and it’s one of the places where infection-fighting
white blood cells are produced. But when bad things happen to someone’s
abdomen—like if they get shot or stabbed or get in a motorcycle accident like my father-in-law,
the spleen can rupture. That’s super dangerous because it can result
in internal bleeding that could be fatal. The spleen can also cause problems if it becomes
enlarged from an infection, because the swelling can trap and destroy healthy blood cells,
leading to anemia. In those cases, doctors will do a splenectomy,
where they remove part or all of the spleen. It’s typically considered a safe procedure,
but because of its role in the immune system, people without a spleen are more prone to
infections, especially from certain bacteria. So for people without spleens, it’s important
for them to boost their immune system by taking preventative antibiotics and staying vaccinated. But the redundancy of the human body means
the immune system isn’t completely destroyed. And the liver can pick up the slack when it
comes to filtering blood. Speaking of which… Your liver does a lot—it processes nutrients,
detoxifies your blood, and produces bile, a fluid that helps digestion. And yet, while you can’t have your whole
liver removed, you can donate more than half of it to help someone whose liver is diseased. What’s really amazing, though, is that unlike
your other organs, your liver will grow back. Your liver is made of hepatocytes, specialized
cells that don’t actively replicate…that is, until some are missing. When a piece of liver is removed, hepatocytes
reactivate and start replicating again, growing new liver cells. Liver regeneration is so efficient that you
can lose up to 65% of your liver and it’ll grow back within a year. Just a quarter of a liver can become a completely
new liver in a transplant recipient. Like any major surgery, there are risks and
potential complications. But if you’re in good health and feeling
altruistic, liver donation is a thing that you can do and probably be totally fine afterwards. Tucked underneath your liver is a small, pear-shaped
organ: the gallbladder. Its main job is to store the bile that the
liver produces until it’s needed for digestion. But sometimes, the components of bile harden
into small pebble-like stones, and if those stones become a problem, doctors just yank
out the whole thing. Bile is mostly made up of cholesterol, bile
salts, and a waste compound called bilirubin that’s responsible for the color of your
poop. In the small intestine, bile’s job is to
help digest fats and break down fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A and vitamin D. But for reasons that actually aren’t well-understood,
the cholesterol and bilirubin in bile can harden into gallstones, which can cause blockages
in the bile duct, the tube that leads to the small intestine. Problematic gallstones are super painful,
and without treatment, they can lead to infections and inflammation and even be deadly. Unlike kidney stones, which can often be peed
out, gallstones don’t exit willingly. Sometimes they can be dissolved with medication,
but usually they return after the meds are stopped. So in most cases, the treatment for gallstones
is to remove the gallbladder entirely by performing a cholecystectomy. This surgery was first performed in 1882. A German surgeon noted that other mammals
don’t have a gallbladder, so he figured ours probably wasn’t too important. And he was kind of right. The bile still gets to your small intestine
without it — it just doesn’t get temporarily stored along the way. If your gallbladder is removed and the surgery
goes smoothly, usually all you have to show for it is a tiny scar and maybe a little bit
of extra indigestion. Each of your kidneys is made up of more than
a million filtering units called nephrons, which remove waste and excess fluid from the
blood. If that doesn’t seem too important to you,
just imagine what would happen to your house if you couldn’t take out the trash for a
couple months. In your body, increased levels of waste can
cause vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration... The whole body can swell, increasing blood
pressure and imparing breathing. And chemical imbalances from improper fluid
management can lead to serious issues like bone and muscle loss. Ultimately, kidney failure can be fatal. Yet, you only really need one of your kidneys. Each day, a pair of kidneys filters about
150 liters of blood to produce about a liter and a half of urine. But even one healthy kidney can do all that
work on its own, which is why live kidney donation is a thing. When one kidney is removed, the other kidney’s
nephrons compensate by getting bigger so they can each do more filtering. It becomes just as effective as two kidneys
would be. And weirdly, leaving a bad kidney or even
two inside of you isn’t a problem, either. Recipients don’t always get their faulty
kidneys removed, so they actually end up living with a total of three kidneys, even though
only one is doing all of the work. Obviously, your body works best and is the
healthiest when all of the parts are present and functioning. But it is definitely possible to live a healthy
and relatively normal life without some organs, because the human body is incredibly good
at adapting to change. Remove an organ or two, and it just takes
it in stride, it’s like, “I’m gonna be one big lung now, I’m fine!” I mean, it doesn’t look that impressive,
I don’t think, but it is pretty wonderful, thank you body! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow. If you liked hearing about your various removable
body parts, you might also enjoy this episode on how some people have bits replaced with

**Transcript**:
[♪ INTRO] The human body is an incredibly complex machine
made up of systems of organs all working together to keep things humming along smoothly. So you’d think that taking anything out
would make the whole thing break down. But of course, lots of people live without
some of their organs. Like, you’re better off without an appendix
if it’s giving you a problem, for example. And you can afford to lose all kinds of more
important organs, too, like a giant chunk of your liver or even an entire lung. Because yeah, your body is a finely tuned
machine — if you don’t mind me saying so — but it also has a bunch of redundancies
that allow it to adapt to some pretty extreme changes. So here are just a few of the bits you can
live without. Number one, the brain. You didn’t think we were gonna go there! Of all of the organs in the human body to
lose, even partially, you would think that the brain would be a total dealbreaker. I mean, it controls or coordinates basically
everything else. But it turns out that sometimes, it’s better
to live with just one hemisphere — half a brain, in other words. Like when people have a kind of epilepsy where
seizures stem from one side of the brain. This can happen with some developmental brain
disorders, or with rare conditions like when one brain hemisphere is abnormally large. One-sided seizures are often difficult to
treat, and they can be debilitating. So sometimes doctors recommend a hemispherectomy:
the removal of some or all of the half of the brain that’s affected. It’s a very rare, extreme operation, obviously,
but when it’s successful, it can result in a relatively normal life. After a hemispherectomy, between 50-90% of
patients become completely seizure free. They do experience some paralysis in the half
of the body normally controlled by the missing brain hemisphere, but most are still able
to walk if they could before the procedure. And the surgery doesn’t usually result in
cognitive deficits, either. Younger patients tend to have fewer side effects
because the remaining healthy hemisphere is still developing, allowing it to compensate
for what’s missing. Still, it’s a difficult procedure with major
risks, so doctors don’t just chop out half of somebody’s brain without carefully weighing
other options. But the idea that you can lose half of your
brain and still be alive at all is pretty incredible. You might even say it’s … mind-blowing. Breathing is another thing that’s kind of
essential for human life, so you would think that losing a lung would cause a lot of problems. But you can get by just fine with just one
lung. Lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, cancer, or tuberculosis can wreck someone’s lung tissues. So in some cases, part of a lung or even the
entire lung will be removed in a surgery called a pneumonectomy. When one lung is removed, the extra space
allows other organs to shift a bit, giving the remaining lung some more room to expand. Studies have shown that in some animals like
dogs and rats, the remaining lung can actually grow new alveoli—the little sacs where gas
exchange happens. It’s thought that children who get a pneumonectomy
might also do this since their lungs are still developing. But in adults, it’s more likely that the
alveoli just stretch and expand a little to move more air through. Ultimately, one lung is able to do about 70-80%
of what two lungs can, and that is usually enough. Depending on age and other health factors,
it might be a bit more difficult to do strenuous activities, but some people who have had this
surgery go on to run marathons, which is more than I can say for me. Your stomach has to be tough enough to mush
around your meals in gastric acid before passing them along to the small intestine. So it’s fairly resilient. But it can still become impaired or diseased
to the point that the patient needs surgery to redirect the digestive tract around their
stomach or to remove part of it. And in some cases, surgeons perform a total
gastrectomy to take out the whole thing and just connect the esophagus directly to
the small intestine. Oddly enough, this doesn’t really affect
the overall process of digestion since most of it occurs in the small intestine anyway. But since there is no stomach to store food
in, patients often need to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Sometimes they also need additional vitamin
supplements for things that aren’t absorbed well by the small intestine, like vitamin
B12 or vitamin D. And some patients might develop a side effect
called dumping syndrome, which, no, does not refer to the ‘dumping’ that you may be
thinking of right now. Sugars and starches are usually digested in
the stomach, but after a gastrectomy, they “dump” straight into the small intestine. Since the intestine isn’t used to that,
it recruits water to help break those things down, and a lot of that water comes from your
blood, causing a drop in blood pressure. With dumping syndrome, that can cause all
kinds of unpleasant symptoms after a meal: cramping and bloating, nausea, weakness, dizziness,
and low blood pressure. But generally, dietary changes are enough
to overcome these issues, and people without a stomach get enough calories to go back to
their lives. The spleen, which sits to the left of the
stomach, is also a pretty useful organ. It’s involved in filtering blood, including
removing and breaking down old red blood cells, and it’s one of the places where infection-fighting
white blood cells are produced. But when bad things happen to someone’s
abdomen—like if they get shot or stabbed or get in a motorcycle accident like my father-in-law,
the spleen can rupture. That’s super dangerous because it can result
in internal bleeding that could be fatal. The spleen can also cause problems if it becomes

This ad isn’t what you think. It’s not promoting a sports team or a grill
company. It’s for an apple. And unlike those that have dominated the produce
section when you were a kid, new breeds like this one have catchy names, logos, and slogans. And are trying to generate buzz before you
can buy them. Historically, our produce has gone unbranded. So how did we end up with all these apples? For most of the past century, America’s
iconic apple was that of Snow White. Lipstick red, with shiny skin and a crisp
white interior, a.k.a. “the Red Delicious.” First grown on an orchard in Iowa and originally
named after its founder, when it came out in the late 1800s, it was dubbed “the best
apple of any time” Growers and retail stores loved the Red delicious
because it looked good. It was uniform in size and color, turned red
before it was ripe, and wouldn’t bruise easily. And Americans loved the taste. By the 1980s, close to half of all apples
grown in the US were Red Delicious. The trouble is, when you bite into one now,
it often doesn’t taste great. People complain of mushy flesh and tough skin.
Its defining characteristic can sometimes be that it has no flavor at all. It takes years and a lot of money to develop
a good tasting apple, but growers were incentivized to cut costs -- at the expense of taste. That is, until one apple proved them all wrong. The Honeycrisp. The honeycrisp is everything that the Red
Delicious was not. When it came out in market in 1991, after
30 years of development, it had a refreshing taste, a delicate skin, and a soft, juicy
crunch. And even though it can cost more than two
times the average price of apples, consumers then and now are willing to pay a premium
price, so much so that it’s now the fifth most produced apple in the US. So the honeycrisp started a sort of revolution
in the apple industry: Now that people knew expensive, flavor-focused apples would sell,
breeders experimented to create tastier, more inventive varieties. And they sought to protect their apples’
good names, by patenting their trees and trademarking
their brand names. This process picked up speed after a 1980
federal law allowed universities to own and patent their inventions, including apple trees. And research programs for apple breeding took
advantage of the new rules. In order to plant these new patented varieties,
growers had to pay up: usually about $1 per patented tree and a portion of sales for use
of a trademarked name. Plus, each trademarked apple had to pass muster
on firmness, sugar content, blemishes and color. These quality checks mean that even though
the trademarked Pink Lady and the generic Cripps Pink originate from the same type of
tree, they look and taste different — the Pink Lady is held to rigorous trademark standards
and that is what, the company says, justifies their higher price. Now, not all new apples get trademarked. It is only those that experts believe can
garner a premium price. And it can take up to 10 years after securing
a patent and trademark to plant and grow enough trees for commercial production. So while they waited on the fruits of their
labor, growers worked on marketing their apple in the hopes finding loyal consumers in a
competitive market. And they’re not alone. Visit your grocery store and you will see
a lot more name brands in the produce section. Branded fruits and vegetables are a growing
trend. While not all branded apples will see success
on par with the honeycrisp, there is one that has high hopes. Washington State growers are ramping up production
of their Cosmic Crisp, an apple that’s both sweet and tart, firm and crisp, and much easier
to grow than the honeycrisp. They’re trying to get people excited about
tasting something new and that’s not a bad thing. While we could see higher prices in the future,
the fruits and veggies themselves will be objectively better. And consumers will have more options, just
like we do with our phones, or our computers, or our cereal. And now, our apples.

to grow than the honeycrisp. They’re trying to get people excited about
tasting something new and that’s not a bad thing. While we could see higher prices in the future,
the fruits and veggies themselves will be objectively better. And consumers will have more options, just

**Transcript**:
This ad isn’t what you think. It’s not promoting a sports team or a grill
company. It’s for an apple. And unlike those that have dominated the produce
section when you were a kid, new breeds like this one have catchy names, logos, and slogans. And are trying to generate buzz before you
can buy them. Historically, our produce has gone unbranded. So how did we end up with all these apples? For most of the past century, America’s
iconic apple was that of Snow White. Lipstick red, with shiny skin and a crisp
white interior, a.k.a. “the Red Delicious.” First grown on an orchard in Iowa and originally
named after its founder, when it came out in the late 1800s, it was dubbed “the best
apple of any time” Growers and retail stores loved the Red delicious
because it looked good. It was uniform in size and color, turned red
before it was ripe, and wouldn’t bruise easily. And Americans loved the taste. By the 1980s, close to half of all apples
grown in the US were Red Delicious. The trouble is, when you bite into one now,
it often doesn’t taste great. People complain of mushy flesh and tough skin.
Its defining characteristic can sometimes be that it has no flavor at all. It takes years and a lot of money to develop
a good tasting apple, but growers were incentivized to cut costs -- at the expense of taste. That is, until one apple proved them all wrong. The Honeycrisp. The honeycrisp is everything that the Red
Delicious was not. When it came out in market in 1991, after
30 years of development, it had a refreshing taste, a delicate skin, and a soft, juicy
crunch. And even though it can cost more than two
times the average price of apples, consumers then and now are willing to pay a premium
price, so much so that it’s now the fifth most produced apple in the US. So the honeycrisp started a sort of revolution
in the apple industry: Now that people knew expensive, flavor-focused apples would sell,
breeders experimented to create tastier, more inventive varieties. And they sought to protect their apples’
good names, by patenting their trees and trademarking
their brand names. This process picked up speed after a 1980
federal law allowed universities to own and patent their inventions, including apple trees. And research programs for apple breeding took
advantage of the new rules. In order to plant these new patented varieties,
growers had to pay up: usually about $1 per patented tree and a portion of sales for use
of a trademarked name. Plus, each trademarked apple had to pass muster
on firmness, sugar content, blemishes and color. These quality checks mean that even though
the trademarked Pink Lady and the generic Cripps Pink originate from the same type of
tree, they look and taste different — the Pink Lady is held to rigorous trademark standards
and that is what, the company says, justifies their higher price. Now, not all new apples get trademarked. It is only those that experts believe can

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’re on the trail of a werewolf that’s been terrorizing your town. After months of detective work, you’ve narrowed your suspects to 
one of five people: the mayor, the tailor, the baker, the grocer, or the carpenter. You’ve invited them to dinner 
with a simple plan: you’ll slip a square of 
a rare werewolf antidote into each of their dinners. Unfortunately, your pet goat
just ate four of the squares, and you only have one left. Luckily, the remaining square is 50 grams, and the minimum effective dose 
is 10 grams. If you can precisely divide the 
square into fifths you’ll have just enough 
antidote for everyone. You’ll have to use a laser-cutting tool
to cut up the square; every other means available to you
isn’t precise enough. There are 8 points that can act 
as starting or ending points for each cut. To use the device, you’ll
have to input pairs of points that tell the laser where to begin 
and end each cut, and then the laser executes
all the cuts simultaneously. It’s okay to cut the square 
into as many pieces as you want, as long as you can group them
into 10 gram portions. But you can’t fold the square 
or alter it otherwise, and you only get one shot 
at using the laser cutter. The full moon is rising,  and in a moment someone
will transform and tear you all apart unless you can cure them first. How can you divide the antidote 
into perfect fifths, cure the secret werewolf, 
and save everyone? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 When it comes to puzzles that
involve cutting and rearranging, it’s often helpful to actually 
take a piece of paper and try cutting it up to see what
you can get. If we cut BF and DH we’d get fourths,
but we need fifths. Maybe there’s a way to shave a bit off
of a quarter to get exactly one fifth. Cutting BE looks good at first, 
but that last cut takes a off a quarter of a quarter, leaving us with a portion of 3/16: 
just smaller than a fifth, and not enough to cure a werewolf. What if we started with BE instead? That would also give us a quarter. And is there a way to shave
just a bit more off? Both DG and CH look promising. If we make one more cut, from A to F, we may start to notice something. With these four cuts—from B to E, 
D to G, F to A, and H to C—we’ve got four triangles and a square in the middle. But the pieces that make 
each triangle can also be rearranged to make a square
identical to the middle one. This means that we’ve split
the antidote into perfect fifths! What’s interesting about this 
sort of problem is that while it’s possible to solve 
it by starting from the geometry, it’s actually easier to start 
experimenting and see where that gets you. That wouldn’t be as viable if the square 
had, say, 24 cut points, but with just 8 there
are only so many reasonable options. You secretly dose each of the townspeople as the full moon emerges in the sky. And just as you do, 
a terrible transformation begins. Then, just as suddenly, it reverses. Your measurements were perfect,  and the people and animals of the 
town can rest a little easier.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’re on the trail of a werewolf that’s been terrorizing your town. After months of detective work, you’ve narrowed your suspects to 
one of five people: the mayor, the tailor, the baker, the grocer, or the carpenter. You’ve invited them to dinner 
with a simple plan: you’ll slip a square of 
a rare werewolf antidote into each of their dinners. Unfortunately, your pet goat
just ate four of the squares, and you only have one left. Luckily, the remaining square is 50 grams, and the minimum effective dose 
is 10 grams. If you can precisely divide the 
square into fifths you’ll have just enough 
antidote for everyone. You’ll have to use a laser-cutting tool
to cut up the square; every other means available to you
isn’t precise enough. There are 8 points that can act 
as starting or ending points for each cut. To use the device, you’ll
have to input pairs of points that tell the laser where to begin 
and end each cut, and then the laser executes
all the cuts simultaneously. It’s okay to cut the square 
into as many pieces as you want, as long as you can group them
into 10 gram portions. But you can’t fold the square 
or alter it otherwise, and you only get one shot 
at using the laser cutter. The full moon is rising,  and in a moment someone
will transform and tear you all apart unless you can cure them first. How can you divide the antidote 
into perfect fifths, cure the secret werewolf, 
and save everyone? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 When it comes to puzzles that
involve cutting and rearranging, it’s often helpful to actually 
take a piece of paper and try cutting it up to see what
you can get. If we cut BF and DH we’d get fourths,
but we need fifths. Maybe there’s a way to shave a bit off
of a quarter to get exactly one fifth. Cutting BE looks good at first, 
but that last cut takes a off a quarter of a quarter, leaving us with a portion of 3/16: 
just smaller than a fifth, and not enough to cure a werewolf. What if we started with BE instead? That would also give us a quarter. And is there a way to shave
just a bit more off? Both DG and CH look promising. If we make one more cut, from A to F, we may start to notice something. With these four cuts—from B to E, 
D to G, F to A, and H to C—we’ve got four triangles and a square in the middle. But the pieces that make 
each triangle can also be rearranged to make a square
identical to the middle one. This means that we’ve split
the antidote into perfect fifths! What’s interesting about this 
sort of problem is that while it’s possible to solve 
it by starting from the geometry, it’s actually easier to start 
experimenting and see where that gets you. That wouldn’t be as viable if the square 
had, say, 24 cut points, but with just 8 there
are only so many reasonable options. You secretly dose each of the townspeople as the full moon emerges in the sky. And just as you do, 
a terrible transformation begins. Then, just as suddenly, it reverses. Your measurements were perfect,  and the people and animals of the 
town can rest a little easier.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
More than six thousand light years from the surface of the earth, a rapidly spinning neutron star called the Black Widow pulsar blasts its companion brown dwarf 
star with radiation as the two orbit each other 
every 9 hours. Standing on our own planet, you might think you’re just an observer
of this violent ballet. But in fact, both stars are pulling you 
towards them. And you’re pulling back, connected across trillions of kilometers by gravity. Gravity is the attractive force 
between two objects with mass— any two objects with mass. Which means that every object in the
universe attracts every other object: every star, black hole, human being, smartphone, and atom are all constantly pulling on each other. So why don’t we feel pulled in billions 
of different directions? Two reasons: mass and distance. The original equation describing the 
gravitational force between two objects was written by Isaac Newton in 1687. Scientists’ understanding of gravity has 
evolved since then, but Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation is still a good approximation 
in most situations. It goes like this: the gravitational force between two 
objects is equal to the mass of one times the mass of the other, multiplied by a very small number called the gravitational constant, and divided by the distance between them, 
squared. If you doubled the mass of one of 
the objects, the force between them would double, too. If the distance between them doubled, the force would be one-fourth as strong. The gravitational force between you and 
the Earth pulls you towards its center, a force you experience as your weight. Let’s say this force is about 800 Newtons when you’re standing at sea level. If you traveled to the Dead Sea, the force would increase by a tiny 
fraction of a percent. And if you climbed to the top of Mount 
Everest, the force would decrease— but again, by a minuscule amount. Traveling higher would make a bigger dent 
in gravity’s influence, but you won’t escape it. Gravity is generated by variations 
in the curvature of spacetime— the three dimensions of space plus time— which bend around any object 
that has mass. Gravity from Earth reaches the 
International Space Station, 400 kilometers above the earth, with almost its original intensity. If the space station was stationary 
on top of a giant column, you’d still experience ninety percent of the gravitational force there 
that you do on the ground. Astronauts just experience weightlessness because the space station is constantly 
falling towards earth. Fortunately, it’s orbiting the planet 
fast enough that it never hits the ground. By the time you made it to 
the surface of the moon, around 400,000 kilometers away, Earth’s gravitational pull would be less than 0.03 percent of 
what you feel on earth. The only gravity you’d be aware of 
would be the moon’s, which is about one sixth as strong 
as the earth’s. Travel farther still and Earth’s gravitational pull on you
will continue to decrease, but never drop to zero. Even safely tethered to the Earth, we’re subject to the faint tug of distant 
celestial bodies and nearby earthly ones. The Sun exerts a force of about 
half a Newton on you. If you’re a few meters away from a 
smartphone, you'll experience a mutual force of a few piconewtons. That’s about the same as the 
gravitational pull between you and the Andromeda Galaxy, which is 2.5 million light years away but about a trillion times as massive 
as the sun. But when it comes to escaping gravity, there’s a loophole. If all the mass around us is 
pulling on us all the time, how would Earth’s gravity change if you tunneled deep below the surface, assuming you could do so without being 
cooked or crushed? If you hollowed out the center 
of a perfectly spherical Earth— which it isn’t, but let’s just say it 
were— you’d experience an identical pull from 
all sides. And you’d be suspended, weightless, only encountering the tiny pulls 
from other celestial bodies. So you could escape the Earth’s gravity 
in such a thought experiment— but only by heading straight into it.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
More than six thousand light years from the surface of the earth, a rapidly spinning neutron star called the Black Widow pulsar blasts its companion brown dwarf 
star with radiation as the two orbit each other 
every 9 hours. Standing on our own planet, you might think you’re just an observer
of this violent ballet. But in fact, both stars are pulling you 
towards them. And you’re pulling back, connected across trillions of kilometers by gravity. Gravity is the attractive force 
between two objects with mass— any two objects with mass. Which means that every object in the
universe attracts every other object: every star, black hole, human being, smartphone, and atom are all constantly pulling on each other. So why don’t we feel pulled in billions 
of different directions? Two reasons: mass and distance. The original equation describing the 
gravitational force between two objects was written by Isaac Newton in 1687. Scientists’ understanding of gravity has 
evolved since then, but Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation is still a good approximation 
in most situations. It goes like this: the gravitational force between two 
objects is equal to the mass of one times the mass of the other, multiplied by a very small number called the gravitational constant, and divided by the distance between them, 
squared. If you doubled the mass of one of 
the objects, the force between them would double, too. If the distance between them doubled, the force would be one-fourth as strong. The gravitational force between you and 
the Earth pulls you towards its center, a force you experience as your weight. Let’s say this force is about 800 Newtons when you’re standing at sea level. If you traveled to the Dead Sea, the force would increase by a tiny 
fraction of a percent. And if you climbed to the top of Mount 
Everest, the force would decrease— but again, by a minuscule amount. Traveling higher would make a bigger dent 
in gravity’s influence, but you won’t escape it. Gravity is generated by variations 
in the curvature of spacetime— the three dimensions of space plus time— which bend around any object 
that has mass. Gravity from Earth reaches the 
International Space Station, 400 kilometers above the earth, with almost its original intensity. If the space station was stationary 
on top of a giant column, you’d still experience ninety percent of the gravitational force there 
that you do on the ground. Astronauts just experience weightlessness because the space station is constantly 
falling towards earth. Fortunately, it’s orbiting the planet 
fast enough that it never hits the ground. By the time you made it to 
the surface of the moon, around 400,000 kilometers away, Earth’s gravitational pull would be less than 0.03 percent of 
what you feel on earth. The only gravity you’d be aware of 
would be the moon’s, which is about one sixth as strong 
as the earth’s. Travel farther still and Earth’s gravitational pull on you
will continue to decrease, but never drop to zero. Even safely tethered to the Earth, we’re subject to the faint tug of distant 
celestial bodies and nearby earthly ones. The Sun exerts a force of about 
half a Newton on you. If you’re a few meters away from a 
smartphone, you'll experience a mutual force of a few piconewtons. That’s about the same as the 
gravitational pull between you and the Andromeda Galaxy, which is 2.5 million light years away but about a trillion times as massive 
as the sun. But when it comes to escaping gravity, there’s a loophole. If all the mass around us is 
pulling on us all the time, how would Earth’s gravity change if you tunneled deep below the surface, assuming you could do so without being 
cooked or crushed? If you hollowed out the center 
of a perfectly spherical Earth— which it isn’t, but let’s just say it 
were— you’d experience an identical pull from 
all sides. And you’d be suspended, weightless, only encountering the tiny pulls 
from other celestial bodies. So you could escape the Earth’s gravity 
in such a thought experiment— but only by heading straight into it.

**Transcript**:
There’s a two-letter word that we hear everywhere. OK. Okay. OK, are you OK Annie? OK OK OK, OK ladies… OK might be the most recognizable word on
the planet. OK! OK. It’s essential to how we communicate with
each other, and even with our technology. Alexa, turn off the living room light. OK. You probably use it every day – even if
you don’t notice it. But, what does OK actually mean? And where did it come from? Hm. OK. Okay then. OK, thank you. OK actually traces back to an 1830s fad of
intentionally misspelling abbreviations. Young “intellectual” types in Boston delighted
those “in the know” with butchered coded messages such as KC, or “knuff ced”, KY,
“know yuse,” and OW, “oll wright.” Haha. But thanks to a couple of lucky breaks, one
abbreviation rose above the rest: OK, or “oll korrect." In the early 1800s, “all correct” was
a common phrase used to confirm that everything was in order. Its abbreviated cousin started going mainstream
on March 23, 1839, when OK was first published in the Boston Morning Post. Soon other papers picked up on the joke and
spread it around the country, until OK was something everyone knew about, not just a
few Boston insiders. And OK’s newfound popularity even prompted
a flailing US president from Kinderhook, New York, to adopt it as a nickname during his
1840 reelection campaign. Van Buren’s supporters formed OK Clubs all
over the country, and their message was pretty clear: Old Kinderhook was “oll korrect.” The campaign was highly publicized and turned
pretty nasty in the press. His opponents ended up turning the abbreviation
around on him, saying it stood for “Orful Konspiracy” or “Orful Katastrophe” Hah. In the end, even a clever nickname didn’t
save Van Buren’s presidency. But it was a win for OK. That 1840 presidential campaign firmly established
OK in the American vernacular. And while similar abbreviations fell out of
fashion, OK made the crossover from slang into legitimate, functional use thanks to
one invention: the telegraph. If we lower the bridge, the current flows
to the sounder. At the other end, the current energizes an
electromagnet and this attracts the armature. The armature clicks down against a screw and
taps out a message. The telegraph debuted in 1844, just five years
after OK. It transmitted short messages in the form
of electric pulses, with combinations of dots and dashes representing letters of the alphabet. This was OK’s moment to shine. The two letters were easy to tap out and very
unlikely to be confused with anything else. It was quickly adopted as a standard acknowledgement
of a transmission received, especially by operators on the expanding US railroad. This telegraphic manual from 1865 even goes
as far as to say that “no message is ever regarded as transmitted until the office receiving
it gives O K.” OK had become serious business. But there’s another big reason the two letters
stuck around, and it’s not just because they’re easy to communicate. It has to do with how OK looks. Or more specifically, how the letter K looks
and sounds. It’s really uncommon to start a word with
the letter K in English — it’s ranked around 22nd in the alphabet. That rarity spurred a “Kraze for K” at
the turn of the century in advertising and print, where companies replaced hard Cs with
Ks in order to Katch your eye. The idea was that modifying a word — like
Klearflax Linen Rugs or this Kook-Rite Stove, for example — would draw more attention
to it. And that’s still a visual strategy: We see
K represented in modern corporate logos, like Krispy-Kreme and Kool-Aid. It’s the K that makes it so memorable. By the 1890s, OK’s Bostonian origins were
already mostly forgotten, and newspapers began to debate its history — often perpetuating
myths in the process that some people still believe. Like the claim that it comes from the Choctaw
word ‘okeh,’ which means ‘so it is.’ Choctaw gave us the word OK… OK’s beginnings had become obscure but it
didn’t really matter anymore — the word was embedded in our language. Today, we use it as the ultimate “neutral
affirmative.” OK then. Okay then. Learn to truly love yourself. OK. OK. Get yourself up here! OK! I don’t know what to say. Say OK. OK. It’s settled then! Allan Metcalf wrote the definitive history
of OK, and he explains that the word “affirms without evaluating,” meaning it doesn’t
convey any feelings — it just acknowledges and accepts information. If you “got home OK,” it just means you
were unharmed. If your “food was OK,” then it was acceptable. And “OK” confirms a change of plans. It’s is sort of a reflex at this point — we
don’t even keep track of how much we use it. Which might be why OK was arguably the first
word spoken when humans landed on the moon. Not bad for a corny joke from the 1830s. Alright guys, cut it out.

**Transcript**:
Just between your chest and abdomen is where you’ll find one of the most
important muscles you probably didn't know you had: the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES. When functioning properly, this ring of tissue plays a crucial
role in helping us eat. But when the LES malfunctions, it becomes the main player in heartburn --a searing, sometimes sour-tasting
chest-spasm that many people will experience
at some point in their lives. We know that humans have
been battling heartburn for hundreds, if not thousands of years. But recently the incidence has risen, making it a common stomach 
complaint worldwide. When the symptoms of heartburn become more
more regular and intense —such as twice a week or more-- it’s diagnosed as Gastroesophageal
Reflux Disease, or GERD. But what causes this problem, and how can it be stopped? Heartburn starts in an area called the gastroesophageal junction, 
where the LES resides. This smooth, muscular ring of the LES is moderated by an intricate 
tree of nerve roots that connect to the brain, 
the heart, and the lungs. After food enters the stomach
from the esophagus, the muscle’s task is to stop it from surging back up again. The LES contracts, squeezing 
the stomach entrance and creating a high pressure zone that prevents digestive acids 
from seeping out. But if the LES relaxes at the
wrong moment or gradually weakens, it becomes like a faulty, ill-fitting lid, causing the area to depressurize. That allows burning stomach acid-- and even chunks of food--to spurt into the esophagus, sometimes going 
as far up as the mouth. The cause of all this internal drama has long been put down to diet. Foods like caffeine and peppermint contain ingredients that may have a
relaxing affect on the LES, which makes it incapable of doing its job. Other acidic foods, 
like citrus and tomatoes, can worsen irritation of the esophagus when they leach out with stomach acid. Carbonated beverages can similarly bubble up in the stomach, forcing open the valve. But researchers have discovered
that food isn’t the only trigger. Smoking poses a risk, because the nicotine
in cigarettes relaxes the LES. Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol may have a similar effect. Pregnant women often experience
more heartburn due to the pressure of a growing baby
on their stomachs. and the levels of certain hormones 
in their bodies. Obesity can cause hernias that disrupt the anti-reflux barrier of
the gastroesophageal junction that normally protects 
against heartburn. Numerous medications, 
including those for asthma, high blood pressure, birth control, 
and depression can also have unintended 
effects on the LES. An occasional bout of heartburn isn't necessarily something to worry about. But, if heartburn starts happening regularly, it can weaken the LES muscle over time, letting more and more acid escape. And if it goes untreated, this can cause bigger problems. Over time, constant acid 
leakage from heartburn may form scar tissue which narrows the esophageal tube, making it 
harder to swallow food. Ongoing reflux can also damage the cells lining the esophagus--a rare
condition called Barrett’s esophagus, which can elevate the risk of esophageal cancer. Luckily, heartburn is often treatable with a range of medicines that can help neutralize or reduce stomach acid. In extreme cases, some people have surgery to tighten the LES to 
minimize their distress. But we can often stop heartburn before it reaches that point. Reducing the consumption 
of certain foods, not smoking, and maintaining 
a healthy weight can all dramatically reduce reflux. With proper care we can 
help our LES’s keep the chemical fountain of 
our stomachs in proper order and avoid having to feel the burn.

But, if heartburn starts happening regularly, it can weaken the LES muscle over time, letting more and more acid escape. And if it goes untreated, this can cause bigger problems. Over time, constant acid 
leakage from heartburn may form scar tissue which narrows the esophageal tube, making it 
harder to swallow food. Ongoing reflux can also damage the cells lining the esophagus--a rare
condition called Barrett’s esophagus, which can elevate the risk of esophageal cancer. Luckily, heartburn is often treatable with a range of medicines that can help neutralize or reduce stomach acid. In extreme cases, some people have surgery to tighten the LES to 
minimize their distress. But we can often stop heartburn before it reaches that point. Reducing the consumption 
of certain foods, not smoking, and maintaining 
a healthy weight can all dramatically reduce reflux. With proper care we can 
help our LES’s keep the chemical fountain of 
our stomachs in proper order and avoid having to feel the burn.

**Transcript**:
Spindly trees, rusted gates, crumbling stone, a solitary mourner— these things come to mind 
when we think of cemeteries. But not so long ago, many burial grounds were lively places, with blooming gardens and crowds of people strolling among the headstones. How did our cemeteries 
become what they are today? Some have been around for centuries, like the world’s largest, Wadi al-Salaam, where more than five million 
people are buried. But most of the places we’d recognize 
as cemeteries are much younger. In fact, for much of human history, we didn’t bury our dead at all. Our ancient ancestors had many other ways 
of parting with the dead loved ones. Some were left in caves, others in trees or on mountaintops. Still others were sunk in lakes, put out to sea, ritually cannibalized, or cremated. All of these practices, though some may seem strange today, were ways of venerating the dead. By contrast, the first known burials about 120,000 years ago were likely reserved for transgressors, excluding them from the usual rites intended to honor the dead. But the first burials revealed some
advantages over other practices: they protected bodies from scavengers 
and the elements, while shielding loved ones from the 
sight of decay. These benefits may have shifted 
ancient people’s thinking toward graves designed to honor the dead, and burial became more common. Sometimes, these graves contained 
practical or ritual objects, suggesting belief in an afterlife Communal burials first appeared in North 
Africa and West Asia around 10 to 15,000 years ago, around the same time as the first 
permanent settlements in these areas. These burial grounds created permanent 
places to commemorate the dead. The nomadic Scythians littered the steppes with grave mounds known as kurgans. The Etruscans built expansive necropoles, their grid-patterned streets 
lined with tombs. In Rome, subterranean catacombs housed both cremation urns and intact remains. The word cemetery, or “sleeping chamber,” was first used by ancient Greeks, who built tombs in graveyards at the edges of their cities. In medieval European cities, Christian churchyards provided 
rare, open spaces that accommodated the dead, but also hosted markets, fairs, 
and other events. Farmers even grazed cattle in them, believing graveyard grass made 
for sweeter milk. As cities grew during the industrial 
revolution, large suburban cemeteries replaced 
smaller urban churchyards. Cemeteries like the 110-acre 
Père-Lachaise in Paris or the 72-acre Mt. Auburn 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts were lushly landscaped gardens filled with sculpted stones and ornate tombs. Once a luxury reserved for the rich 
and powerful, individually marked graves became available to the middle 
and working classes. People visited cemeteries for funerals, but also for anniversaries, holidays, or simply an afternoon outdoors. By the late 19th century, as more public 
parks and botanical gardens appeared, cemeteries began to lose visitors. Today, many old cemeteries are 
lonely places. Some are luring visitors back with tours, concerts, and other attractions. But even as we revive old cemeteries, we’re rethinking the future of burial. Cities like London, New York, and 
Hong Kong are running out of burial space. Even in places where space isn’t so tight, cemeteries permanently occupy land that can’t be otherwise cultivated 
or developed. Traditional burial consumes materials like metal, stone, and concrete, and can pollute soil and groundwater with toxic chemicals. With increasing awareness of the 
environmental costs, people are seeking alternatives. Many are turning to cremation and 
related practices. Along with these more conventional 
practices, people can now have their remains 
shot into space, used to fertilize a tree, or made into jewelry, fireworks, and even tattoo ink. In the future, options like these may 
replace burial completely. Cemeteries may be our most familiar 
monuments to the departed, but they’re just one step in our ever-evolving process of remembering and honoring the dead.

**Transcript**:
Spindly trees, rusted gates, crumbling stone, a solitary mourner— these things come to mind 
when we think of cemeteries. But not so long ago, many burial grounds were lively places, with blooming gardens and crowds of people strolling among the headstones. How did our cemeteries 
become what they are today? Some have been around for centuries, like the world’s largest, Wadi al-Salaam, where more than five million 
people are buried. But most of the places we’d recognize 
as cemeteries are much younger. In fact, for much of human history, we didn’t bury our dead at all. Our ancient ancestors had many other ways 
of parting with the dead loved ones. Some were left in caves, others in trees or on mountaintops. Still others were sunk in lakes, put out to sea, ritually cannibalized, or cremated. All of these practices, though some may seem strange today, were ways of venerating the dead. By contrast, the first known burials about 120,000 years ago were likely reserved for transgressors, excluding them from the usual rites intended to honor the dead. But the first burials revealed some
advantages over other practices: they protected bodies from scavengers 
and the elements, while shielding loved ones from the 
sight of decay. These benefits may have shifted 
ancient people’s thinking toward graves designed to honor the dead, and burial became more common. Sometimes, these graves contained 
practical or ritual objects, suggesting belief in an afterlife Communal burials first appeared in North 
Africa and West Asia around 10 to 15,000 years ago, around the same time as the first 
permanent settlements in these areas. These burial grounds created permanent 
places to commemorate the dead. The nomadic Scythians littered the steppes with grave mounds known as kurgans. The Etruscans built expansive necropoles, their grid-patterned streets 
lined with tombs. In Rome, subterranean catacombs housed both cremation urns and intact remains. The word cemetery, or “sleeping chamber,” was first used by ancient Greeks, who built tombs in graveyards at the edges of their cities. In medieval European cities, Christian churchyards provided 
rare, open spaces that accommodated the dead, but also hosted markets, fairs, 
and other events. Farmers even grazed cattle in them, believing graveyard grass made 
for sweeter milk. As cities grew during the industrial 
revolution, large suburban cemeteries replaced 
smaller urban churchyards. Cemeteries like the 110-acre 
Père-Lachaise in Paris or the 72-acre Mt. Auburn 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts were lushly landscaped gardens filled with sculpted stones and ornate tombs. Once a luxury reserved for the rich 
and powerful, individually marked graves became available to the middle 
and working classes. People visited cemeteries for funerals, but also for anniversaries, holidays, or simply an afternoon outdoors. By the late 19th century, as more public 
parks and botanical gardens appeared, cemeteries began to lose visitors. Today, many old cemeteries are 
lonely places. Some are luring visitors back with tours, concerts, and other attractions. But even as we revive old cemeteries, we’re rethinking the future of burial. Cities like London, New York, and 
Hong Kong are running out of burial space. Even in places where space isn’t so tight, cemeteries permanently occupy land that can’t be otherwise cultivated 
or developed. Traditional burial consumes materials like metal, stone, and concrete, and can pollute soil and groundwater with toxic chemicals. With increasing awareness of the 
environmental costs, people are seeking alternatives. Many are turning to cremation and 
related practices. Along with these more conventional 
practices, people can now have their remains 
shot into space, used to fertilize a tree, or made into jewelry, fireworks, and even tattoo ink. In the future, options like these may 
replace burial completely. Cemeteries may be our most familiar 
monuments to the departed, but they’re just one step in our ever-evolving process of remembering and honoring the dead.

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1895, 
crowds flooded the Coney Island boardwalk to see the latest marvel 
of roller coaster technology: the Flip Flap Railway. This was America’s first-ever looping coaster – but its thrilling flip came at a price. The ride caused numerous cases of 
severe whiplash, neck injury and even ejections, all due to its signature loop. Today, coasters can pull off 
far more exciting tricks, without resorting to the “thrill” 
of a hospital visit. But what exactly are roller coasters 
doing to your body, and how have they managed to get scarier
and safer at the same time? At the center of every roller coaster 
design is gravity. Unlike cars or transit trains, most coasters are propelled around their tracks almost entirely by gravitational energy. After the coaster crests the initial lift hill, it begins an expertly engineered cycle – building potential energy on ascents
and expending kinetic energy on descents. This rhythm repeats throughout the ride, acting out the coaster engineer’s
choreographed dance of gravitational energy. But there’s a key variable in this cycle
that wasn’t always so carefully considered: you. In the days of the Flip-Flap, ride designers were most concerned 
with coasters getting stuck somewhere along the track. This led early builders to overcompensate, hurling trains down hills and pulling on the brakes 
when they reached the station. But as gravity affects the cars, 
it also affects the passengers. And under the intense conditions
of a coaster, gravity’s effects are multiplied. There’s a common unit used by jet pilots, astronauts, and coaster designers called “g force”. One G force is the familiar tug of gravity
you feel when standing on Earth – this is the force of Earth’s 
gravitational pull on our bodies. But as riders accelerate and decelerate, they experience more or less 
gravitational force. Modern ride designers know that the 
body can handle up to roughly 5 Gs, but the Flip-Flap and its contemporaries 
routinely reached up to 12 Gs. At those levels of gravitational pressure, blood is sent flying from your brain
to your feet, leading to light-headedness or blackouts as the brain struggles to stay conscious. And oxygen deprivation in the retinal cells
impairs their ability to process light, causing greyed out vision or temporary blindness. If the riders are upside down,
blood can flood the skull, causing a bout of crimson vision
called a “redout”. Conversely, negative G’s 
create weightlessness. Within the body, short-term weightlessness
is mostly harmless. It can contribute to a rider’s 
motion sickness by suspending the fluid in 
their inner ears which coordinates balance. But the bigger potential danger – and thrill – comes from what ride designers 
call airtime. This is when riders typically
experience seat separation, and, without the proper precautions, ejection. The numerous belts and harnesses 
of modern coasters have largely solved this issue, but the passenger’s ever-changing position
can make it difficult to determine what needs to be 
strapped down. Fortunately, modern ride designers
are well aware of what your body, and the coaster, can handle. Coaster engineers play these competing 
forces against each other, to relieve periods of intense pressure
with periods of no pressure at all. And since a quick transition from 
positive to negative G-force can result in whiplash, headaches, 
and back and neck pain, they avoid the extreme changes
in speed and direction so common in thrill rides of old. Modern rides are also much sturdier, closely considering the amount
of gravity they need to withstand. At 5 G’s, your body feels 5 times heavier; so if you weigh 100lbs, you’d exert the weight of 500 lbs
on the coaster. Engineers have to account for 
the multiplied weight of every passenger when designing 
a coaster’s supports. Still, these rides aren’t for everyone. The floods of adrenaline, 
light-headedness, and motion sickness aren’t going anywhere soon. But today’s redundant restraints, 
3D modeling and simulation software have made roller coasters safer 
and more thrilling than ever. Our precise knowledge about the 
limits of the human body have helped us build coasters that are 
faster, taller, and loopier – and all without going off the rails.

far more exciting tricks, without resorting to the “thrill” 
of a hospital visit. But what exactly are roller coasters 
doing to your body, and how have they managed to get scarier
and safer at the same time? At the center of every roller coaster 
design is gravity. Unlike cars or transit trains, most coasters are propelled around their tracks almost entirely by gravitational energy. After the coaster crests the initial lift hill, it begins an expertly engineered cycle – building potential energy on ascents
and expending kinetic energy on descents. This rhythm repeats throughout the ride, acting out the coaster engineer’s
choreographed dance of gravitational energy. But there’s a key variable in this cycle
that wasn’t always so carefully considered: you. In the days of the Flip-Flap, ride designers were most concerned 
with coasters getting stuck somewhere along the track. This led early builders to overcompensate, hurling trains down hills and pulling on the brakes 
when they reached the station. But as gravity affects the cars, 
it also affects the passengers. And under the intense conditions
of a coaster, gravity’s effects are multiplied. There’s a common unit used by jet pilots, astronauts, and coaster designers called “g force”. One G force is the familiar tug of gravity
you feel when standing on Earth – this is the force of Earth’s 
gravitational pull on our bodies. But as riders accelerate and decelerate, they experience more or less 
gravitational force. Modern ride designers know that the 
body can handle up to roughly 5 Gs, but the Flip-Flap and its contemporaries 
routinely reached up to 12 Gs. At those levels of gravitational pressure, blood is sent flying from your brain
to your feet, leading to light-headedness or blackouts as the brain struggles to stay conscious. And oxygen deprivation in the retinal cells
impairs their ability to process light, causing greyed out vision or temporary blindness. If the riders are upside down,
blood can flood the skull, causing a bout of crimson vision
called a “redout”. Conversely, negative G’s 
create weightlessness. Within the body, short-term weightlessness
is mostly harmless. It can contribute to a rider’s 
motion sickness by suspending the fluid in 
their inner ears which coordinates balance. But the bigger potential danger – and thrill – comes from what ride designers 
call airtime. This is when riders typically
experience seat separation, and, without the proper precautions, ejection. The numerous belts and harnesses 
of modern coasters have largely solved this issue, but the passenger’s ever-changing position
can make it difficult to determine what needs to be 
strapped down. Fortunately, modern ride designers
are well aware of what your body, and the coaster, can handle. Coaster engineers play these competing 
forces against each other, to relieve periods of intense pressure
with periods of no pressure at all. And since a quick transition from 
positive to negative G-force can result in whiplash, headaches, 
and back and neck pain, they avoid the extreme changes
in speed and direction so common in thrill rides of old. Modern rides are also much sturdier, closely considering the amount
of gravity they need to withstand. At 5 G’s, your body feels 5 times heavier; so if you weigh 100lbs, you’d exert the weight of 500 lbs
on the coaster. Engineers have to account for 
the multiplied weight of every passenger when designing 
a coaster’s supports. Still, these rides aren’t for everyone. The floods of adrenaline, 
light-headedness, and motion sickness aren’t going anywhere soon. But today’s redundant restraints, 
3D modeling and simulation software have made roller coasters safer 
and more thrilling than ever. Our precise knowledge about the 
limits of the human body have helped us build coasters that are 
faster, taller, and loopier – and all without going off the rails.

**Transcript**:
One of the kingdom’s
most prosperous merchants has been exposed for his corrupt dealings. Nearly all of his riches are invested in a collection of 30 exquisite Burmese rubies, and the crowd in the square is clamoring for their confiscation to reimburse his victims. But the scoundrel and his allies at court have made a convincing case that at least some of his wealth was obtained legitimately, and through good service to the crown. The king ponders for a minute and announces his judgment. Because there’s no way to know which portion of the rubies 
were bought with ill-gotten wealth, the fine will be determined through 
a game of wits between the merchant and the king’s most clever advisor – you. You’re both told the rules in advance. The merchant will be allowed to
discreetly divide his rubies among three boxes, which
will then be placed in front of you. You will be given three cards, and must write a number 
between 1 and 30 on each, before putting a card in
front of each of the boxes. The boxes will then all be opened. For each box, you will receive exactly as many rubies as the number written
on the corresponding card, if the box has that many. But if your number is greater than 
the number of rubies actually there, the scoundrel gets to keep the entire box. The king puts just two constraints on how
the scoundrel distributes his rubies. Each box must contain at least two rubies and one of the boxes must contain 
exactly six more rubies than another— but you won’t know which boxes those are. After a few minutes of deliberation, the merchant hides the gems, 
and the boxes are brought in front of you. Which numbers should you choose in order to guarantee the largest possible
fine for the scoundrel and the greatest compensation 
for his victims? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You don’t want to overshoot
by being too greedy. But there is a way you can guarantee to get more than half of the scoundrel’s 
stash. The situation resembles an 
adversarial game like chess – only here you can’t see the 
opponent’s position. To figure out the minimum number of rubies
you’re guaranteed to win, you need to look for the worst case
scenario, as if the merchant already knew your move and could arrange the rubies 
to minimize your winnings. Because you have no way of knowing which
boxes will have more or fewer rubies, you should pick the same number for each. Suppose you write three 9’s. The scoundrel might have allocated the
rubies as 8, 14 and 8. In that case, you’d receive 9 from the
middle box and no others. On the other hand, you can be
sure that at least two boxes have a minimum of 8 rubies. Here’s why. We’ll start by assuming the opposite, that two boxes have 7 or fewer. Those could not be the two that 
differ by 6, because every box must have 
at least 2 rubies. In that case, the third box would have at
most 13 rubies—that’s 7 plus 6. Add up all three of those boxes, and the most that could equal is 27. Since that’s less than 30, this scenario isn’t possible. You now know, by what’s called
a proof by contradiction, that two of the boxes have 
8 or more rubies. If you ask for 8 from all three boxes you’ll receive at least 16— and that’s the best you can guarantee, as you can see by thinking again
about the 8, 14, 8 scenario. You’ve recovered more than half the 
scoundrel’s fortune as restitution for the public. And though he’s managed to hold
on to some of his rubies, his fortune has definitely 
lost some of its shine.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
One of the kingdom’s
most prosperous merchants has been exposed for his corrupt dealings. Nearly all of his riches are invested in a collection of 30 exquisite Burmese rubies, and the crowd in the square is clamoring for their confiscation to reimburse his victims. But the scoundrel and his allies at court have made a convincing case that at least some of his wealth was obtained legitimately, and through good service to the crown. The king ponders for a minute and announces his judgment. Because there’s no way to know which portion of the rubies 
were bought with ill-gotten wealth, the fine will be determined through 
a game of wits between the merchant and the king’s most clever advisor – you. You’re both told the rules in advance. The merchant will be allowed to
discreetly divide his rubies among three boxes, which
will then be placed in front of you. You will be given three cards, and must write a number 
between 1 and 30 on each, before putting a card in
front of each of the boxes. The boxes will then all be opened. For each box, you will receive exactly as many rubies as the number written
on the corresponding card, if the box has that many. But if your number is greater than 
the number of rubies actually there, the scoundrel gets to keep the entire box. The king puts just two constraints on how
the scoundrel distributes his rubies. Each box must contain at least two rubies and one of the boxes must contain 
exactly six more rubies than another— but you won’t know which boxes those are. After a few minutes of deliberation, the merchant hides the gems, 
and the boxes are brought in front of you. Which numbers should you choose in order to guarantee the largest possible
fine for the scoundrel and the greatest compensation 
for his victims? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You don’t want to overshoot
by being too greedy. But there is a way you can guarantee to get more than half of the scoundrel’s 
stash. The situation resembles an 
adversarial game like chess – only here you can’t see the 
opponent’s position. To figure out the minimum number of rubies
you’re guaranteed to win, you need to look for the worst case
scenario, as if the merchant already knew your move and could arrange the rubies 
to minimize your winnings. Because you have no way of knowing which
boxes will have more or fewer rubies, you should pick the same number for each. Suppose you write three 9’s. The scoundrel might have allocated the

**Transcript**:
The earliest time measurements were observations of cycles of the natural world, using patterns of changes from day to night and season to season to build calendars. More precise time-keeping, like sundials and mechanical clocks, eventually came along to put time in more convenient boxes. But what exactly is it that we’re measuring? Is time something that physically exists, or is it just in our heads? At first the answer seems obvious— of course time exists; it constantly unfolds all around us, and it’s hard to imagine the universe without it. But our understanding of time started getting complicated thanks to Einstein. His theory of relativity tells us that time passes for everyone, but doesn’t always pass at the same rate for people in different situations, like those travelling close to the speed of light or orbiting a supermassive black hole. Einstein resolved the malleability of time by combining it with space to define space-time, which can bend, but behaves
in consistent, predictable ways. Einstein’s theory seemed to confirm that time is woven into the very fabric of the universe. But there’s a big question it didn’t fully resolve: why is it we can move through space in any direction, but through time in only one? No matter what we do, the past is always, stubbornly, behind us. This is called the arrow of time. When a drop of food coloring is dropped into a glass of water, we instinctively know that the coloring will drift out from the drop, eventually filling the glass. Imagine watching the opposite happen. Here, we’d recognize time as unfolding backwards. We live in a universe where the food coloring spreads out in the water,  not a universe where it collects together. In physics, this is described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says that systems will gain disorder, or entropy, over time. Systems in our universe move from order to disorder, and it is that property of the universe that defines the direction of time’s arrow. So if time is such a fundamental property, it should be in our most fundamental equations describing the universe, right? We currently have two sets of equations that govern physics. General relativity describes the behavior of very large things, while quantum physics explains the very small. One of the biggest goals in theoretical physics over the last half century has been reconciling the two into one fundamental “theory of everything." There have been many attempts —none yet proven— and they treat time in different ways. Oddly enough, one contender called the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, doesn’t include time at all. Like all current theories of everything, that equation is speculative. But as a thought experiment, if it or a similarly time-starved equation turned out to be true, would that mean that time doesn’t exist, at the most fundamental level? Could time just be some sort of illusion generated by the limitations of the way we perceive the universe? We don’t yet know, but maybe that’s the wrong way of thinking about it. Instead of asking if time exists as a fundamental property, maybe it could exist as an emergent one. Emergent properties are things that don’t exist in individual pieces of a system, but do exist for the system as a whole. Each individual water molecule doesn’t have a tide, but the whole ocean does. A movie creates change through time by using a series of still images that appear to have a fluid, continuous change between them. Flipping through the images fast enough, our brains perceive the passage of time from the sequence of still images. No individual frame of the movie changes or contains the passage of time, but it’s a property that comes out of how the pieces are strung together. The movement is real, yet also an illusion. Could the physics of time somehow be a similar illusion? Physicists are still exploring these and other questions, so we’re far from a complete explanation. At least for the moment.

When a drop of food coloring is dropped into a glass of water, we instinctively know that the coloring will drift out from the drop, eventually filling the glass. Imagine watching the opposite happen. Here, we’d recognize time as unfolding backwards. We live in a universe where the food coloring spreads out in the water,  not a universe where it collects together. In physics, this is described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says that systems will gain disorder, or entropy, over time. Systems in our universe move from order to disorder, and it is that property of the universe that defines the direction of time’s arrow. So if time is such a fundamental property, it should be in our most fundamental equations describing the universe, right? We currently have two sets of equations that govern physics. General relativity describes the behavior of very large things, while quantum physics explains the very small. One of the biggest goals in theoretical physics over the last half century has been reconciling the two into one fundamental “theory of everything." There have been many attempts —none yet proven— and they treat time in different ways. Oddly enough, one contender called the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, doesn’t include time at all. Like all current theories of everything, that equation is speculative. But as a thought experiment, if it or a similarly time-starved equation turned out to be true, would that mean that time doesn’t exist, at the most fundamental level? Could time just be some sort of illusion generated by the limitations of the way we perceive the universe? We don’t yet know, but maybe that’s the wrong way of thinking about it. Instead of asking if time exists as a fundamental property, maybe it could exist as an emergent one. Emergent properties are things that don’t exist in individual pieces of a system, but do exist for the system as a whole. Each individual water molecule doesn’t have a tide, but the whole ocean does. A movie creates change through time by using a series of still images that appear to have a fluid, continuous change between them. Flipping through the images fast enough, our brains perceive the passage of time from the sequence of still images. No individual frame of the movie changes or contains the passage of time, but it’s a property that comes out of how the pieces are strung together. The movement is real, yet also an illusion. Could the physics of time somehow be a similar illusion? Physicists are still exploring these and other questions, so we’re far from a complete explanation. At least for the moment.

- [Instructor] You may have heard from your second grade teacher
that if you swallow gum, it could stay in your stomach forever or worse, it could grow into
a rubber tree in your stomach. Well, that's true, so don't do it. (peppy instrumental music) Okay, maybe not. Swallowing chewing gum isn't
really gonna plant trees in your stomach, but that's no reason to start doing it regularly. Here's what happens to your
body when you swallow gum. When you eat standard food,
three processes go to work in your body to turn that food into fuel. The first is obvious, it's chewing. The process breaks food down into smaller and smaller pieces, increasing the surface area. Meanwhile, saliva coats those
pieces, delivering enzymes that help break down the food. Finally, once swallowed, the stomach acids turn any
remaining food pieces into mush. This lets the food pass through the rest of your digestive track smoothly, but gum doesn't play by those rules. As much as you chew it, gum doesn't break into smaller pieces. That's because it's gum, duh! Gum has been around much
longer than you think. Ancient Mayans and Aztecs harvested resin from a sapodilla tree. They would dry it into a chaw and chew it to stave off hunger. Even back then, it was also recognized as a breath freshener. However, most gum today
is made from natural or synthetic polymers,
most commonly butyl rubber. It's used in all kinds of products, including adhesives, fiber
optics, sealants, cling film, paper, fuel, explosives,
sporting equipment, roofing, bottle stoppers, and tires. But don't worry, the butyl in
your gum won't make you sick. That's because it can't be broken down. The wad of chewing gum
hits your stomach intact. Your saliva enzymes and your stomach acid can't touch the butyl in the gum base, but that doesn't mean it just hangs out. Your body is equipped to handle
gum the same way it deals with other food that
it can't fully digest, like corn and sunflower seeds. (peppy instrumental music) The muscles of your
digestive tract move it along and eventually flush it out of
your system in a day or two, along with everything else. So, no, the gum doesn't stay in your body when you swallow it, but that's no reason to start
gulping it down by the pack. The more gum your body has to process, the higher likelihood
that it will build up. This gum mass can potentially
clog your digestive tract, causing an intestinal blockage which can trigger stomach
pain or constipation. There's a lovely name for
this blockage, a bezoar. An 18-year-old Israeli woman once suffered from a bezoar that blocked her stomach. The problem? Turns out she had been
swallowing at least five pieces of gum every day. The blockage had grown so large
that doctors had to break it into smaller pieces and then fish it out
of her piece by piece. But chewing gum alone isn't
necessarily bad for you. A couple of small studies
have shown that the act of chewing gum can
actually help relax you, because it can help
reduce levels of cortisol, a common stress hormone, in your saliva. Feel free to unwrap a stick. You won't be alone, 56%
of Americans chew gum, each about 280 sticks per year. It's a two billion dollar
industry in the U.S., but be wary of swallowing
it once you're done. The occasional piece of gum won't hurt, but with everything else your
body already does for you, why put it through the extra work? Also, don't spit it out on the ground. That's just gross. Find a trashcan, like a normal person.

**Transcript**:
Alexios Komnenos, Byzantine emperor, led his army to meet the Scythian hordes in battle. For good luck, he carried one of the holiest relics in Christendom: the veil that had belonged to the Virgin Mary. Unfortunately, it didn’t help. Not only was his army defeated, but as they fled, the Emperor was stabbed in the buttocks. To make matters worse, a strong wind made the relic too heavy to carry, so he stashed it in some bushes as he escaped. But even as he fled, he managed to slay some Scythians and rescue a few comrades. At least, this is how Alexios' daughter Anna recounted the story, writing nearly 60 years later. She spent the last decade of her long life creating a 500-page history of her father’s reign called The Alexiad. Written in Greek, the book was modeled after ancient Greek epics and historical writings. But Anna had a different, trickier task than the writers in these traditions: as a princess writing about her own family, she had to balance her loyalty to her kin with her obligation to portray events accurately, navigating issues like Alexios’s embarrassing stab to the buttocks. A lifetime of study and participation in her father’s government prepared Anna for this undertaking. Anna was born in 1083, shortly after her father seized control of the Roman Empire following a decade of brutal civil wars and revolts. The empire was deep in decline when he came to power, and threatened from all sides: by the Seljuk Turks in the East, the Normans in the West, and Scythian raiders to the north. Over the course of Anna’s childhood and adolescence, Alexios fought constant military campaigns to secure the frontiers of his empire, even striking up an uneasy alliance with the Crusaders. Meanwhile in Constantinople, Anna fought her own battle. She was expected to study subjects considered proper for a Byzantine princess, like courtly etiquette and the Bible, but preferred classical myth and philosophy. To access this material, she had to learn to read and speak Ancient Greek, by studying secretly at night. Eventually her parents realized how serious she was, and provided her with tutors. Anna expanded her studies to classical literature, rhetoric, history, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. One scholar even complained that her constant requests for more Aristotle commentaries were wearing out his eyes. At age fifteen, Anna married Nikephoros Bryennios to quell old conflicts between their families and strengthen Alexios’s reign. Fortunately, Anna and Nikephoros ended up sharing many intellectual interests, hosting and debating the leading scholars of the day. Meanwhile, Alexios’s military excursions began to pay off, restoring many of the empire’s former territories. As her father aged, Anna and her husband helped her parents with their imperial duties. During this time, Anna reportedly advocated for just treatment of the people in their disputes with the government. After Alexios’s death, Anna’s brother John ascended to the throne and Anna turned back to philosophy and scholarship. Her husband had written a history arguing that his grandfather would have made a better emperor than Alexios, but Anna disagreed. She began working on the Alexiad, which made the case for her father's merits as emperor. Spanning the late 11th and early 12th centuries of Byzantine history, the Alexiad recounts the tumultuous events of Alexios’s reign, and Anna’s own reactions to those events, like bursting into tears at the thought of the deaths of her parents and husband. She may have included 
these emotional passages in hopes that they would make her writing more palatable to a society that believed women shouldn't write about battles and empires. While her loyalty to her father was evident in her favorable account of his reign, she also included criticism and her opinions of events. In the centuries after her death, Anna’s Alexiad was copied over and over, and remains an invaluable eyewitness account of Alexios’s reign today. And through her epic historical narrative, Anna Komnene secured her own place in history.

**Transcript**:
Alexios Komnenos, Byzantine emperor, led his army to meet the Scythian hordes in battle. For good luck, he carried one of the holiest relics in Christendom: the veil that had belonged to the Virgin Mary. Unfortunately, it didn’t help. Not only was his army defeated, but as they fled, the Emperor was stabbed in the buttocks. To make matters worse, a strong wind made the relic too heavy to carry, so he stashed it in some bushes as he escaped. But even as he fled, he managed to slay some Scythians and rescue a few comrades. At least, this is how Alexios' daughter Anna recounted the story, writing nearly 60 years later. She spent the last decade of her long life creating a 500-page history of her father’s reign called The Alexiad. Written in Greek, the book was modeled after ancient Greek epics and historical writings. But Anna had a different, trickier task than the writers in these traditions: as a princess writing about her own family, she had to balance her loyalty to her kin with her obligation to portray events accurately, navigating issues like Alexios’s embarrassing stab to the buttocks. A lifetime of study and participation in her father’s government prepared Anna for this undertaking. Anna was born in 1083, shortly after her father seized control of the Roman Empire following a decade of brutal civil wars and revolts. The empire was deep in decline when he came to power, and threatened from all sides: by the Seljuk Turks in the East, the Normans in the West, and Scythian raiders to the north. Over the course of Anna’s childhood and adolescence, Alexios fought constant military campaigns to secure the frontiers of his empire, even striking up an uneasy alliance with the Crusaders. Meanwhile in Constantinople, Anna fought her own battle. She was expected to study subjects considered proper for a Byzantine princess, like courtly etiquette and the Bible, but preferred classical myth and philosophy. To access this material, she had to learn to read and speak Ancient Greek, by studying secretly at night. Eventually her parents realized how serious she was, and provided her with tutors. Anna expanded her studies to classical literature, rhetoric, history, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. One scholar even complained that her constant requests for more Aristotle commentaries were wearing out his eyes. At age fifteen, Anna married Nikephoros Bryennios to quell old conflicts between their families and strengthen Alexios’s reign. Fortunately, Anna and Nikephoros ended up sharing many intellectual interests, hosting and debating the leading scholars of the day. Meanwhile, Alexios’s military excursions began to pay off, restoring many of the empire’s former territories. As her father aged, Anna and her husband helped her parents with their imperial duties. During this time, Anna reportedly advocated for just treatment of the people in their disputes with the government. After Alexios’s death, Anna’s brother John ascended to the throne and Anna turned back to philosophy and scholarship. Her husband had written a history arguing that his grandfather would have made a better emperor than Alexios, but Anna disagreed. She began working on the Alexiad, which made the case for her father's merits as emperor. Spanning the late 11th and early 12th centuries of Byzantine history, the Alexiad recounts the tumultuous events of Alexios’s reign, and Anna’s own reactions to those events, like bursting into tears at the thought of the deaths of her parents and husband. She may have included 
these emotional passages in hopes that they would make her writing more palatable to a society that believed women shouldn't write about battles and empires. While her loyalty to her father was evident in her favorable account of his reign, she also included criticism and her opinions of events. In the centuries after her death, Anna’s Alexiad was copied over and over, and remains an invaluable eyewitness account of Alexios’s reign today. And through her epic historical narrative, Anna Komnene secured her own place in history.

**Transcript**:
A shabby man named Estragon, sits near a tree at dusk and struggles to remove his boot. He’s soon joined by his friend Vladimir, who reminds his anxious companion that they must wait here for someone called Godot. So begins a vexing cycle in which the two debate when Godot will come, why they’re waiting, and whether they’re even at the right tree. From here, Waiting for Godot only gets stranger - but it’s considered a play that changed the face of modern drama. Written by Samuel Beckett between 1949 and 1955, it offers a simple but stirring question - what should the characters do? Estragon: Don’t let's do anything. It's safer. Vladimir: Let’s wait and see what he says. Estragon: Who? Vladimir: Godot. Estragon: Good idea. Such cryptic dialogue and circular reasoning are key features of the Theatre of the Absurd, a movement which emerged after the Second World War and found artists struggling to find meaning in devastation. The absurdists deconstructed plot, character and language to question their meaning and share their profound uncertainty on stage. While this may sound grim, the absurd blends its hopelessness with humor. This is reflected in Beckett’s unique approach to genre in Waiting for Godot, which he branded “a tragicomedy in two acts." Tragically, the characters are locked in an existential conundrum: they wait in vain for an unknown figure to give them a sense of purpose, but their only sense of purpose comes from the act of waiting, While they wait, they sink into boredom, express religious dread and contemplate suicide. But comically, there is a jagged humor to their predicament, which comes across in their language and movements. Their interactions are filled with bizarre wordplay, repetition and double entendres, as well as physical clowning, singing and dancing, and frantically swapping their hats. It’s often unclear whether the audience is supposed to laugh or cry - or whether Beckett saw any difference between the two. Born in Dublin, Beckett studied English, French and Italian before moving to Paris, where he spent most of his life writing theatre, poetry and prose. While Beckett had a lifelong love of language, he also made space for silence by incorporating gaps, pauses and moments of emptiness into his work. This was a key feature of his trademark uneven tempo and black humor, which became popular throughout the Theatre of the Absurd. He also cultivated a mysterious persona, and refused to confirm or deny any speculations about the meaning of his work. This kept audiences guessing, increasing their fascination with his surreal worlds and enigmatic characters. The lack of any clear meaning makes Godot endlessly open to interpretation. Critics have offered countless readings of the play, resulting in a cycle of ambiguity and speculation that mirrors the plot of the drama itself. It's been read as an allegory of the Cold War, the French Resistance, and Britain’s colonization of Ireland. The dynamic of the two protagonists has also sparked intense debate. They’ve been read as survivors of the apocalypse, an aging couple, two impotent friends, and even as personifications of Freud’s ego and id. Famously, Beckett said the only thing he could be sure of was that Vladimir and Estragon were "wearing bowler hats." Like the critical speculation and maddening plot, their language often goes in circles as the two bicker and banter, lose their train of thought, and pick up right where they left off: Vladimir: We could start all over again perhaps Estragon: That should be easy Vladimir: It’s the start that’s difficult Estragon: You can start from anything Vladimir: Yes, but you have to decide. Beckett reminds us that just like our daily lives, the world onstage doesn’t always make sense. It can explore both reality and illusion, the familiar and the strange. And although a tidy narrative still appeals, the best theatre keeps us thinking – and waiting.

Beckett reminds us that just like our daily lives, the world onstage doesn’t always make sense. It can explore both reality and illusion, the familiar and the strange. And although a tidy narrative still appeals, the best theatre keeps us thinking – and waiting.

**Transcript**:
A shabby man named Estragon, sits near a tree at dusk and struggles to remove his boot. He’s soon joined by his friend Vladimir, who reminds his anxious companion that they must wait here for someone called Godot. So begins a vexing cycle in which the two debate when Godot will come, why they’re waiting, and whether they’re even at the right tree. From here, Waiting for Godot only gets stranger - but it’s considered a play that changed the face of modern drama. Written by Samuel Beckett between 1949 and 1955, it offers a simple but stirring question - what should the characters do? Estragon: Don’t let's do anything. It's safer. Vladimir: Let’s wait and see what he says. Estragon: Who? Vladimir: Godot. Estragon: Good idea. Such cryptic dialogue and circular reasoning are key features of the Theatre of the Absurd, a movement which emerged after the Second World War and found artists struggling to find meaning in devastation. The absurdists deconstructed plot, character and language to question their meaning and share their profound uncertainty on stage. While this may sound grim, the absurd blends its hopelessness with humor. This is reflected in Beckett’s unique approach to genre in Waiting for Godot, which he branded “a tragicomedy in two acts." Tragically, the characters are locked in an existential conundrum: they wait in vain for an unknown figure to give them a sense of purpose, but their only sense of purpose comes from the act of waiting, While they wait, they sink into boredom, express religious dread and contemplate suicide. But comically, there is a jagged humor to their predicament, which comes across in their language and movements. Their interactions are filled with bizarre wordplay, repetition and double entendres, as well as physical clowning, singing and dancing, and frantically swapping their hats. It’s often unclear whether the audience is supposed to laugh or cry - or whether Beckett saw any difference between the two. Born in Dublin, Beckett studied English, French and Italian before moving to Paris, where he spent most of his life writing theatre, poetry and prose. While Beckett had a lifelong love of language, he also made space for silence by incorporating gaps, pauses and moments of emptiness into his work. This was a key feature of his trademark uneven tempo and black humor, which became popular throughout the Theatre of the Absurd. He also cultivated a mysterious persona, and refused to confirm or deny any speculations about the meaning of his work. This kept audiences guessing, increasing their fascination with his surreal worlds and enigmatic characters. The lack of any clear meaning makes Godot endlessly open to interpretation. Critics have offered countless readings of the play, resulting in a cycle of ambiguity and speculation that mirrors the plot of the drama itself. It's been read as an allegory of the Cold War, the French Resistance, and Britain’s colonization of Ireland. The dynamic of the two protagonists has also sparked intense debate. They’ve been read as survivors of the apocalypse, an aging couple, two impotent friends, and even as personifications of Freud’s ego and id. Famously, Beckett said the only thing he could be sure of was that Vladimir and Estragon were "wearing bowler hats." Like the critical speculation and maddening plot, their language often goes in circles as the two bicker and banter, lose their train of thought, and pick up right where they left off: Vladimir: We could start all over again perhaps Estragon: That should be easy Vladimir: It’s the start that’s difficult Estragon: You can start from anything Vladimir: Yes, but you have to decide.

**Transcript**:
The annals of Ancient Egyptian king 
Thutmose III described a marvelous foreign bird that “gives birth daily.” Zoroastrians viewed them as spirits whose cries told of the cosmic struggle between darkness and light. Romans brought them on
their military campaigns to foretell the success of future battles. And today, this bird still occupies
an important, though much less honorable position – on our dinner plates. The modern chicken is descended
primarily from the Red Junglefowl, and partially from three other 
closely related species, all native to India and Southeast Asia. The region’s bamboo plants produce massive amounts of fruit just once every few decades. Junglefowls’ ability to lay eggs daily may have evolved to take advantage 
of these rare feasts, increasing their population
when food was abundant. This was something humans could exploit on a consistent basis, and the birds’ weak flight capabilities and limited need for space made them easy to capture and contain. The earliest domesticated chickens, dating at least back to 7,000 years ago, weren’t bred for food, but for something considered
less savory today. The aggressiveness of breeding males, armed with natural leg spurs, made cockfighting a popular entertainment. By the second millennium BCE, chickens had spread from the 
Indus Valley to China and the Middle East to occupy
royal menageries and to be used in religious rituals. But it was in Egypt where the next chapter in
the bird’s history began. When a hen naturally incubates eggs, she will stop laying new ones and sit on a “clutch” of 6
or more eggs for 21 days. By the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, the Egyptians had learned to artificially incubate chicken eggs by placing them in baskets over hot ashes. That freed up hens to continue
laying daily, and what had been a royal delicacy or religious offering became a common meal. Around the same time as Egyptians
were incubating eggs, Phoenician merchants introduced
chickens to Europe, where they quickly became
an essential part of European livestock. However, for a long time, the chicken’s revered status 
continued to exist alongside its culinary one. The Ancient Greeks used fighting roosters as inspirational examples 
for young soldiers. The Romans consulted chickens as oracles. And as late as the 7th Century, the chicken was considered
a symbol for Christianity. Over the next few centuries, chickens accompanied humans
wherever they went, spreading throughout the world
through trade, conquest, and colonization. After the Opium Wars, Chinese breeds were brought to England and crossed with local chickens. This gave rise to a phenomenon called “Hen Fever” or “The Fancy”, with farmers all over Europe striving to breed new varieties with particular combinations of traits. This trend also caught the attention of a certain Charles Darwin,
who wondered if a similar selective breeding process
occurred in nature. Darwin would observe hundreds of chickens while finalizing his historic work introducing the theory of Evolution. But the chicken’s greatest
contribution to science was yet to come. In the early 20th century, a trio of British scientists conducted extensive crossbreeding
of chickens, building on Gregor Mendel’s studies of genetic inheritance. With their high genetic diversity, many distinct traits, and only 7 months between generations, chickens were the perfect subject. This work resulted in the famous
Punnett Square, used to show the genotypes
that would result from breeding a given pairing. Since then, numerous breeding initiatives
have made chickens bigger and meatier, and allowed them to lay 
more eggs than ever. Meanwhile, chicken production has shifted 
to an industrial, factory-like model, with birds raised in spaces 
with a footprint no larger than a sheet of paper. And while there’s been a shift
towards free-range farming due to animal rights 
and environmental concerns, most of the world’s more than
22 billion chickens today are factory farmed. From gladiators and gifts to the gods, to traveling companions 
and research subjects, chickens have played many roles
over the centuries. And though they may not have come

The annals of Ancient Egyptian king 
Thutmose III described a marvelous foreign bird that “gives birth daily.” Zoroastrians viewed them as spirits whose cries told of the cosmic struggle between darkness and light. Romans brought them on
their military campaigns to foretell the success of future battles. And today, this bird still occupies
an important, though much less honorable position – on our dinner plates. The modern chicken is descended
primarily from the Red Junglefowl, and partially from three other 
closely related species, all native to India and Southeast Asia. The region’s bamboo plants produce massive amounts of fruit just once every few decades. Junglefowls’ ability to lay eggs daily may have evolved to take advantage

**Transcript**:
Mounting his skinny steed, the protagonist of Don Quixote charges an army of giants. In his eyes, it is his duty to vanquish these behemoths in the name of his beloved lady, Dulcinea. However, this act of valor is ill conceived. As his squire Sancho Panza explains to him time and again, these aren’t giants; they are merely windmills. Don Quixote is undeterred, but his piercing lance is soon caught in their sails. Never discouraged, the knight stands proudly, and becomes even more convinced of his mission. This sequence encapsulates much of what is loved about Don Quixote, the epic, illogical, and soulful tale of Alonso Quijano, who becomes the clumsy but valiant Don Quixote of la Mancha, known as the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance. Originally published in two volumes, the narrative follows Don Quixote as he travels through central and northern Spain fighting the forces of evil. Despite Don Quixote’s lofty imagination, his creator, Miguel de Cervantes, could never have imagined his book would become the best-selling novel of all time. Barring 5 years as a soldier, and 5 more enslaved by pirates, Cervantes spent most of his life as a struggling poet and playwright. It wasn’t until his late 50’s that he published his greatest creation: an epic satire of chivalry novels. At this time, medieval books chronicling the adventures of knights and their moral code dominated European culture. While Cervantes was a fan, he was weary of these repetitive tomes, which focused more on listing heroic feats than character development. To challenge them, he wrote Don Quixote, the story of a hidalgo, or idle nobleman, who spends his days and nights reading chivalry novels. Driven mad by these stories, he fashions himself a champion for the downtrodden. Everyone in his village tries to convince him to give up his lunacy, going so far as to burn some of the lurid books in his personal library. But Don Quixote is unstoppable. He dresses up in old shining armor, mounts his skinny horse, and leaves his village in search of glory. Cervantes’ novel unfolds as a collection of episodes detailing the mishaps of the valiant knight. Yet unlike the chivalry books and perhaps all other prior fiction, Cervantes’ story deeply investigates the protagonist’s inner life. Don Quixote matures as the narrative develops, undergoing a noticeable transformation. This literary revelation has led many scholars to call Don Quixote the first modern novel. And this character development doesn’t happen in isolation. Early on, Don Quixote is joined by a villager-turned-squire named Sancho Panza. Sancho and Don Quixote are a study in opposites: with one as the grounded realist to the other’s idealism. Their lively, evolving friendship is often credited as the original hero and sidekick duo, inspiring centuries of fictional partnerships. Don Quixote was a huge success. Numerous editions were published across Europe in the seventeenth century. Even in the Americas, where the Church banned all novels for being sinful distractions, audiences were known to enjoy pirated editions. The book was so well received that readers clamored for more. After a rival author attempted to cash in on a fake follow-up, Cervantes released the official sequel in response. Now published alongside the first volume as a completed text, this second volume picks up where the original left off, only now Don Quixote and Sancho have become folk heroes. Just as in real-life, Cervantes included his novel’s success in the world of his characters. This unconventional meta-awareness created philosophical complexity, as the knight and his squire ponder the meaning of their story. Unfortunately, Cervantes had sold the book’s publishing rights for very little. He died rich in fame alone. But his treatise on the power of creativity and individualism has inspired art, literature, popular culture, and even political revolution. Don Quixote argues that our imagination greatly informs our actions, making us capable of change, and, indeed, making us human.

While Cervantes was a fan, he was weary of these repetitive tomes, which focused more on listing heroic feats than character development. To challenge them, he wrote Don Quixote, the story of a hidalgo, or idle nobleman, who spends his days and nights reading chivalry novels. Driven mad by these stories, he fashions himself a champion for the downtrodden. Everyone in his village tries to convince him to give up his lunacy, going so far as to burn some of the lurid books in his personal library. But Don Quixote is unstoppable. He dresses up in old shining armor, mounts his skinny horse, and leaves his village in search of glory. Cervantes’ novel unfolds as a collection of episodes detailing the mishaps of the valiant knight. Yet unlike the chivalry books and perhaps all other prior fiction, Cervantes’ story deeply investigates the protagonist’s inner life. Don Quixote matures as the narrative develops, undergoing a noticeable transformation. This literary revelation has led many scholars to call Don Quixote the first modern novel. And this character development doesn’t happen in isolation. Early on, Don Quixote is joined by a villager-turned-squire named Sancho Panza. Sancho and Don Quixote are a study in opposites: with one as the grounded realist to the other’s idealism. Their lively, evolving friendship is often credited as the original hero and sidekick duo, inspiring centuries of fictional partnerships. Don Quixote was a huge success. Numerous editions were published across Europe in the seventeenth century. Even in the Americas, where the Church banned all novels for being sinful distractions, audiences were known to enjoy pirated editions. The book was so well received that readers clamored for more. After a rival author attempted to cash in on a fake follow-up, Cervantes released the official sequel in response. Now published alongside the first volume as a completed text, this second volume picks up where the original left off, only now Don Quixote and Sancho have become folk heroes. Just as in real-life, Cervantes included his novel’s success in the world of his characters. This unconventional meta-awareness created philosophical complexity, as the knight and his squire ponder the meaning of their story. Unfortunately, Cervantes had sold the book’s publishing rights for very little. He died rich in fame alone. But his treatise on the power of creativity and individualism has inspired art, literature, popular culture, and even political revolution. Don Quixote argues that our imagination greatly informs our actions, making us capable of change, and, indeed, making us human.

Why does every keyboard look like this? OK, so this top strip here, there is a 99% chance that on your keyboard it's:  We all have these QWERTY keyboards. There’s probably even one in your pocket, on a screen. But why? Why is this pattern of letters so familiar? “This of course, is the keyboard.” But why, "of course?" QWERTY was just one person’s invention from the 1870s. It’s almost 140 years old,  yet, it's still the standard. “All of these machines are alike in many respects.” We all use it, but don’t know why.  That’s the definition of overrated! And it turns out that this little keyboard is the subject of intense debate, some lies you’ve probably been told before, and a few real explanations that might surprise you.  Including an old fashioned cartel. Lots of people have tried to arrange these jumbled letters. There was a half century period of indecision. Debate. In the 1840's, Hughes Printing Telegraph arranged 
the keys like a piano keyboard. Or, look at the Hansen’s Writing Ball from 1865. People’s fingers pecked at this thing. The letters varied per version, but they showed up in this pattern. This 1868 typewriter looks weird too, 
but it was the start of something. The inventor, was Christopher Latham Sholes. He looked like typewriter Santa Claus,
and he kept going. In 1870, he developed a pattern like this. As of 1873, he’d come up with a keyboard that 
looked a lot like QWERTY. But there were quirks. Notice that period where the R should be. And the A and Z are flipped. The M 
also sits next to the L. Remington, a company that made machines for shooting and sewing, bought the design. Suddenly, they were in the typewriter business. The design Sholes patented in 1878 was basically QWERTY. Along with the numbers, the only weirdness is that M next to the L, and the C and X are flipped compared to a
contemporary keyboard. The company that made Remington Typewriters was soon sending out 
sales packets with the QWERTY we know and love. But that doesn’t quite explain how QWERTY got big. There are urban legends. One’s that QWERTY was designed that way to keep typewriter keys from jamming. But lots of designs could do that, and there’s not a lot of good evidence that 
that's why QWERTY was designed. Other options were even still around in 1890, like the Merritt Typewriter. You moved this handle to the right spot
for your letter and pressed down. The letters weren’t in QWERTY, they were in a big long strip that looked like this. So it was  a KWBHGP keyboard. Many typists believed it worked as well as QWERTY. But the best evidence of all that
QWERTY wasn’t “the perfect design,” might be this invention from 1889. The keyboard? Not QWERTY, but XPMCHR. The inventor? Christopher Latham Sholes, the guy who invented QWERTY. He created it just before he died. Even the creator of QWERTY wasn’t settled on QWERTY! And that’s where the cartel comes in. Look at this king. He has something to do with QWERTY. See the label on his crown?  "Trusts." In the 1890s, many companies merged into trusts that allowed 
them to fix prices and control markets. In 1893, that happened with typewriters, when some of the biggest manufacturers came
together to form Union Typewriter Company. Manufacturers cared most about price and technical improvements, like how the typewriter worked. But there was another effect of the trust. The biggest company made Remington Typewriters, and they used Sholes’ QWERTY keyboard design. The trust did the same. Most experts think the trust didn’t work to fix prices. It had trouble beating innovative competitors. But their market power did fix a pattern on the keyboard. And there’s one more reason why that pattern stuck. Look at these old typewriter ads. Or these early typists. Now you might notice that most of these students are women. That is worth noting! But for the story of QWERTY, it’s more important 
to notice that they’re in a class, together. Typing wasn’t like it is today, where you get one of these at the office, or one of these when you’re born. Typists trained. They took classes. If you took a class, you took it for the most common keyboard. That was QWERTY. People still debate whether QWERTY’s the best. Some say the 1930s DVORAK keyboard is better, others say it too is overrated. Whether it’s the best system or not, QWERTY isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. “How you type is more important than what you type.” “This is the mark of a good typist.” There are so many other unprovable theories 
when it comes to QWERTY. One of my favorites is that the 
keyboard was arranged that way so that sales people could peck out TYPEWRITER 
all on the top of the keyboard.

**Transcript**:
The good news is that your experimental robo-ants are a success! The bad news is that you accidentally just gave them the ability to shoot deadly lasers …and you can’t turn it off. You have five minutes to stop them before the lasers go online. Until then, all of your robo-ants will walk inside their habitat at a speed of exactly 1 meter per minute. If they bump into each other or hit a dead end, they’ll instantly turn around and walk back the way they came. When five minutes are up, they’ll turn on their lasers, break free, and stream out into the world, carving a path of destruction as they go. Your one chance to stop them is to insert the two emergency vacuum nozzles into the habitat and suck the ants up before they break free. The nozzles can press into any one location in the habitat through a membrane covering its front side, and any ants that walk past will be sucked up and deactivated. You can’t move the nozzles once they’re placed without leaving a hole that the robo-ants would pour out of, so choosing the right spots will be key. The habitat is made out of meter-long tubes. When the robots reach an intersection, they will pick randomly whether to go left, right, or forward. They only go backward if they hit hit another robo-ant or a dead end. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of them inside the habitat, and if even one escapes, it’ll do a lot of damage. With just less than five minutes remaining, where should you place the 2 vacuum nozzles to suck up all the robo-ants? Pause the video now if
you want to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 With robo-ants ricocheting all over the habitat, it might seem impossible to stop them before they break free. But this situation is simpler than it seems. Here's why. Imagine just two robo-ants crawling toward each other. When they collide, they immediately reverse directions. And what would that sequence of events look like if they crawled past each other instead? It would look exactly the same before and after their collision, but with their positions swapped. This is true every time a pair of robo-ants meet. Because the identities of individual ants don’t matter, you just need to figure out where you should put the nozzles to capture any single ant walking without interruption for less than 5 minutes, starting from any point in the habitat. That’s much easier to conceptualize and solve. Placing the nozzles at intersections where three or four tubes meet seems like your best bet since that’s where the robo-ants might otherwise change directions and miss your nozzles. There are only four intersections… which two should you pick? The top right intersection has to be one of them. If it isn’t, an ant crawling down from this intersection toward the dead end would crawl for four minutes to get back to the intersection, and then go in any of three directions, walking for at least another minute. Once you’ve placed a nozzle in the top right, the only other choice that has a chance to work is the bottom left. To see that this works, imagine an ant anywhere else in the habitat. Worst case scenario, the ant would start right next to the vacuum nozzle, marching away from it. But in all those worst cases, the ant would march for at most 4 meters before being sucked up into the vacuum. No other choice of two intersection points is guaranteed to get all the robo-ants within five minutes. Having vacuumed them all up, you’ve averted a major crisis. Before you mess with robo-ants again, you’ll want to have a robo-anteater ready. And wouldn’t it be cool if it could fly and breathe fire? There’s no way that could go wrong!

**Transcript**:
The good news is that your experimental robo-ants are a success! The bad news is that you accidentally just gave them the ability to shoot deadly lasers …and you can’t turn it off. You have five minutes to stop them before the lasers go online. Until then, all of your robo-ants will walk inside their habitat at a speed of exactly 1 meter per minute. If they bump into each other or hit a dead end, they’ll instantly turn around and walk back the way they came. When five minutes are up, they’ll turn on their lasers, break free, and stream out into the world, carving a path of destruction as they go. Your one chance to stop them is to insert the two emergency vacuum nozzles into the habitat and suck the ants up before they break free. The nozzles can press into any one location in the habitat through a membrane covering its front side, and any ants that walk past will be sucked up and deactivated. You can’t move the nozzles once they’re placed without leaving a hole that the robo-ants would pour out of, so choosing the right spots will be key. The habitat is made out of meter-long tubes. When the robots reach an intersection, they will pick randomly whether to go left, right, or forward. They only go backward if they hit hit another robo-ant or a dead end. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of them inside the habitat, and if even one escapes, it’ll do a lot of damage. With just less than five minutes remaining, where should you place the 2 vacuum nozzles to suck up all the robo-ants? Pause the video now if
you want to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 With robo-ants ricocheting all over the habitat, it might seem impossible to stop them before they break free. But this situation is simpler than it seems. Here's why. Imagine just two robo-ants crawling toward each other. When they collide, they immediately reverse directions. And what would that sequence of events look like if they crawled past each other instead? It would look exactly the same before and after their collision, but with their positions swapped. This is true every time a pair of robo-ants meet. Because the identities of individual ants don’t matter, you just need to figure out where you should put the nozzles to capture any single ant walking without interruption for less than 5 minutes, starting from any point in the habitat. That’s much easier to conceptualize and solve. Placing the nozzles at intersections where three or four tubes meet seems like your best bet since that’s where the robo-ants might otherwise change directions and miss your nozzles. There are only four intersections… which two should you pick? The top right intersection has to be one of them. If it isn’t, an ant crawling down from this intersection toward the dead end would crawl for four minutes to get back to the intersection, and then go in any of three directions, walking for at least another minute. Once you’ve placed a nozzle in the top right, the only other choice that has a chance to work is the bottom left. To see that this works, imagine an ant anywhere else in the habitat. Worst case scenario, the ant would start right next to the vacuum nozzle, marching away from it. But in all those worst cases, the ant would march for at most 4 meters before being sucked up into the vacuum. No other choice of two intersection points is guaranteed to get all the robo-ants within five minutes. Having vacuumed them all up, you’ve averted a major crisis. Before you mess with robo-ants again, you’ll want to have a robo-anteater ready. And wouldn’t it be cool if it could fly and breathe fire? There’s no way that could go wrong!

**Transcript**:
If we evolved from monkeys,
why are there still monkeys? (Laughter) Well, because we're not monkeys, we're fish. (Laughter) Now, knowing you're a fish
and not a monkey is actually really important
to understanding where we came from. I teach one of the largest
evolutionary biology classes in the US, and when my students finally understand
why I call them fish all the time, then I know I'm getting my job done. But I always have to start my classes
by dispelling some hardwired myths, because without really knowing it,
many of us were taught evolution wrong. For instance, we're taught
to say "the theory of evolution." There are actually many theories,
and just like the process itself, the ones that best fit the data
are the ones that survive to this day. The one we know best
is Darwinian natural selection. That's the process by which organisms
that best fit an environment survive and get to reproduce, while those that are less fit
slowly die off. And that's it. Evolution is as simple as that,
and it's a fact. Evolution is a fact
as much as the "theory of gravity." You can prove it just as easily. You just need to look at your bellybutton that you share
with other placental mammals, or your backbone that you share
with other vertebrates, or your DNA that you share
with all other life on earth. Those traits didn't pop up in humans. They were passed down
from different ancestors to all their descendants, not just us. But that's not really
how we learn biology early on, is it? We learn plants and bacteria
are primitive things, and fish give rise to amphibians
followed by reptiles and mammals, and then you get you, this perfectly evolved creature
at the end of the line. But life doesn't evolve in a line, and it doesn't end with us. But we're always shown evolution
portrayed something like this, a monkey and a chimpanzee, some extinct humans, all on a forward and steady march
to becoming us. But they don't become us
any more than we would become them. We're also not the goal of evolution. But why does it matter? Why do we need to understand
evolution the right way? Well, misunderstanding evolution
has led to many problems, but you can't ask that age-old question, "Where are we from?" without understanding
evolution the right way. Misunderstanding it has led
to many convoluted and corrupted views of how we should treat
other life on earth, and how we should treat each other in terms of race and gender. So let's go back four billion years. This is the single-celled organism
we all came from. At first, it gave rise
to other single-celled life, but these are still evolving to this day, and some would say
the Archaea and Bacteria that make up most of this group is the most successful on the planet. They are certainly going
to be here well after us. About three billion years ago,
multicellularity evolved. This includes your fungi
and your plants and your animals. The first animals to develop
a backbone were fishes. So technically,
all vertebrates are fishes, so technically, you and I are fish. So don't say I didn't warn you. One fish lineage came onto land and gave rise to, among other things,
the mammals and reptiles. Some reptiles become birds,
some mammals become primates, some primates become monkeys with tails, and others become the great apes,
including a variety of human species. So you see, we didn't evolve from monkeys, but we do share
a common ancestor with them. All the while, life
around us kept evolving: more bacteria, more fungi,
lots of fish, fish, fish. If you couldn't tell --
yes, they're my favorite group. (Laughter) As life evolves, it also goes extinct. Most species just last
for a few million years. So you see, most life on earth
that we see around us today are about the same age as our species. So it's hubris,
it's self-centered to think, "Oh, plants and bacteria are primitive, and we've been here
for an evolutionary minute, so we're somehow special." Think of life as being this book,
an unfinished book for sure. We're just seeing the last
few pages of each chapter. If you look out
on the eight million species that we share this planet with, think of them all being
four billion years of evolution. They're all the product of that. Think of us all as young leaves
on this ancient and gigantic tree of life, all of us connected by invisible branches
not just to each other, but to our extinct relatives
and our evolutionary ancestors. As a biologist, I'm still
trying to learn, with others, how everyone's related to each other,
who is related to whom. Perhaps it's better still to think of us
as a little fish out of water. Yes, one that learned to walk and talk, but one that still has
a lot of learning to do about who we are and where we came from. Thank you. (Applause)

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
If we evolved from monkeys,
why are there still monkeys? (Laughter) Well, because we're not monkeys, we're fish. (Laughter) Now, knowing you're a fish
and not a monkey is actually really important
to understanding where we came from. I teach one of the largest
evolutionary biology classes in the US, and when my students finally understand
why I call them fish all the time, then I know I'm getting my job done. But I always have to start my classes
by dispelling some hardwired myths, because without really knowing it,
many of us were taught evolution wrong. For instance, we're taught
to say "the theory of evolution." There are actually many theories,
and just like the process itself, the ones that best fit the data
are the ones that survive to this day. The one we know best
is Darwinian natural selection. That's the process by which organisms
that best fit an environment survive and get to reproduce, while those that are less fit
slowly die off. And that's it. Evolution is as simple as that,
and it's a fact. Evolution is a fact
as much as the "theory of gravity." You can prove it just as easily. You just need to look at your bellybutton that you share
with other placental mammals, or your backbone that you share
with other vertebrates, or your DNA that you share
with all other life on earth. Those traits didn't pop up in humans. They were passed down
from different ancestors to all their descendants, not just us. But that's not really
how we learn biology early on, is it? We learn plants and bacteria
are primitive things, and fish give rise to amphibians
followed by reptiles and mammals, and then you get you, this perfectly evolved creature
at the end of the line. But life doesn't evolve in a line, and it doesn't end with us. But we're always shown evolution
portrayed something like this, a monkey and a chimpanzee, some extinct humans, all on a forward and steady march
to becoming us. But they don't become us
any more than we would become them. We're also not the goal of evolution. But why does it matter? Why do we need to understand
evolution the right way? Well, misunderstanding evolution
has led to many problems, but you can't ask that age-old question, "Where are we from?" without understanding
evolution the right way. Misunderstanding it has led
to many convoluted and corrupted views of how we should treat
other life on earth, and how we should treat each other in terms of race and gender. So let's go back four billion years. This is the single-celled organism
we all came from. At first, it gave rise
to other single-celled life, but these are still evolving to this day, and some would say
the Archaea and Bacteria that make up most of this group is the most successful on the planet. They are certainly going
to be here well after us. About three billion years ago,
multicellularity evolved. This includes your fungi
and your plants and your animals. The first animals to develop
a backbone were fishes. So technically,
all vertebrates are fishes, so technically, you and I are fish. So don't say I didn't warn you. One fish lineage came onto land and gave rise to, among other things,
the mammals and reptiles. Some reptiles become birds,
some mammals become primates, some primates become monkeys with tails, and others become the great apes,
including a variety of human species. So you see, we didn't evolve from monkeys, but we do share
a common ancestor with them. All the while, life
around us kept evolving: more bacteria, more fungi,
lots of fish, fish, fish. If you couldn't tell --
yes, they're my favorite group. (Laughter) As life evolves, it also goes extinct. Most species just last
for a few million years. So you see, most life on earth
that we see around us today are about the same age as our species. So it's hubris,
it's self-centered to think, "Oh, plants and bacteria are primitive, and we've been here
for an evolutionary minute, so we're somehow special." Think of life as being this book,
an unfinished book for sure. We're just seeing the last
few pages of each chapter. If you look out
on the eight million species that we share this planet with, think of them all being
four billion years of evolution. They're all the product of that. Think of us all as young leaves
on this ancient and gigantic tree of life, all of us connected by invisible branches
not just to each other, but to our extinct relatives
and our evolutionary ancestors. As a biologist, I'm still
trying to learn, with others, how everyone's related to each other,
who is related to whom. Perhaps it's better still to think of us
as a little fish out of water. Yes, one that learned to walk and talk, but one that still has
a lot of learning to do about who we are and where we came from. Thank you. (Applause)
