**Transcript**:
and I got my current job I was given a good piece of advice which was to interview three politicians every day and from that much contact with politicians I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another they have what I call logorrhea dementia which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane but what they do have is incredible social skills when you meet them they lock into you they look you in the eye they invade your personal space they massage the back of your head I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal squeezing it I once this was years ago I saw a Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate and they were friends and they hugged each other and they were laughing and their faces were like this far apart and they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other and I was like get a room I don't want to see this but they have those social skills at another case last election cycle I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons bit chip rip zip lip and dip and and he's going into a diner and he goes to the diner introduce himself to a family and says what village are you from in New Hampshire and then he described the home he owned in their village and then he so he goes around the room and then as he's leaving the diner he first names almost everybody he's just met I was like okay that's social skill but the paradox is when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode that social awareness vanishes and they tart talking about like accountants so in the course of my career I've covered a series of failures we sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up and what they really lacked was social trust we invaded Iraq with the military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities we had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn't do anything stupid for 30 years I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureau edek boxes charters private schools vouchers but we've had disappointing results year after year and the fact is people learn from people they love and if you're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student you're not talking about that reality but that reality is expunged from our policymaking process and so that's led to a question for me why are the most socially attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy and I came to the conclusion this is a symptom of a larger problem that for centuries we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that were divided selves that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions and it's led to a view of human nature that were rational individuals who respond and straightforward ways to incentives and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is and it's produced a great amputation a shallow view of human nature we're really good at talking about material things but we're really bad at talking about emotions we're really good at talking about skills and safety and health were really bad at talking about character Allister McIntyre the famous philosopher said that we have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue on or goodness but we no longer have a system by which to connect them and so this has led to a shallow path and politics but also in a whole range of human endeavors you can see it in the way we raise our young kids you go to an elementary school at 3:00 in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out and they're wearing these eighty pound backpacks that if the wind blows them over they're like beetles stuck there on the ground you see these cars that drive up usually it's sobs and Audi's in Volvo's because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car so long as it comes from a country hostile to US foreign policy that's fine they get picked up by these creatures I've called uber moms who are highly successful career women who've taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard and you can usually tell the uber moms because they actually weigh less than their own children so at the moment of conception they're doing little butt exercises the babies plop out they're flashing Mandarin flashcards with the things driving them home and they wanted to be enlightened so they take them to Ben & Jerry's ice cream company with its own foreign policy and one of my books I joke that Ben and Jerry's should make a passive his toothpaste doesn't kill germs just ask them to leave be a big seller and then they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula and you know Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International they buy we buy these seaweed based snacks they're called veggie booty with kale which is their kids at home home and say mom mom I want to snack that a whole prevent colon rectal cancer and so the kids are raised in a certain way jumping through achievement hopes are the things we can measure SAT prep OBO soccer practice they get into competitive colleges they get good jobs and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a superficial manner and they make a ton of money and sometimes you can see them at vacation places like Jackson Hole or Aspen and they're they've become elegant and slender they don't really have thighs they just have one elegant calf on top of another they have kids of their own and they've sort of achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people so their grand moms look like Gertrude Stein their daughters look like Halle Berry I don't know how they've done that they get there and they realize that they it's fashionable now to have dogs 1/3 as tall as your ceiling heights so they've got these furries 160 pound dogs look like velociraptors all named after Jane Austen characters and then when they get old they haven't really developed a philosophy of life but they've decided that I've been successful at everything I'm just not going to die and so they hire personal trainers they're popping cialis like breath mints you see them on the mountains up there they're cross-country ski up the mountain with these grim expressions that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis and sort of as they whizzed by you it's like being passed by a little iron raisinet going up the hill and so this is part of what life is but it's not all of what life is and over the past few years I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are and it's not based on theology or philosophy it's in the study of the mind across all these spheres of research from neuroscience the cognitive science behavioral economists psychologists sociology we're developing a revolution in consciousness and when you synthesize it all it's giving us a new view of human nature and far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature it's a new humanism it's a new enchantment and I think when you synthesize this research you start with three key insights the first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species the unconscious mind does most of the work and so one way to formulate that assists the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute of which can be consciously aware of about 40 and this leads to oddities one of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists people named Lawrence become lawyers because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar which is why I've named my daughter President of the United States Brooks another finding is that the unconscious far from being dumb and sexualized it's actually quite smart so one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture it's really hard to imagine a sofa how it's gonna look in your house and the way you should do that is sort of study the furniture let it marinate in your mind distract yourself and then a few days later go with your gut because unconsciously you've figured it out the second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking people with strokes and lesions in the emotion processing parts of the brain are not super smart they're actually quite sometimes quite helpless and the giant in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning Antonio Damasio and one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value and so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom now I'm a middle-aged guy I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions one of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys they put him into a brain scan machine this is apocryphal by the way but I don't care and it and they have them watch a horror movie and then they had some them describe their feelings toward their wives and the the brain scans were identical in both activities it was just sheer terror so me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony but it is the central organizing process of the way we think it tells us what to imprint a brain is the record of the feelings of a life and the third insight is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals we're social animals not rational animals we emerge out of relationships and we are deeply interpenetrated one with another and so when we see another person we reenact on our own minds what we see in their minds when we watch a car chase in a movie we it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase when we watch pornography it's a little like having sex though probably not as good and you see this in when lovers walk down the street when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion the deep interpenetrate and this revolution and who we are gives us a different way of seeing I think politics a different way most importantly of seeing human capital we are now children of the French enlightenment we believe that reason is the highest of the faculties but I think this research shows that the British enlightenment of the Scottish enlightenment with David Hume Adam Smith actually had a better handle on who we are that reason is often weak our sentiments are strong and our sentiments are often trustworthy and this works corrects that bias in our culture that dehumanizing bias it gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life when we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily things like grades SATs degrees the number of year and for schooling what it really takes to do well to leave a meaningful life are things that are deeper things we don't really even have words for and so let me list just a couple of things I think this research points us toward trying to understand the first gift our talent is mind-sight the ability to enter into other people's minds and learn what they have to offer babies come with this ability meltzoff who's at the University of Washington leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old he wagged his tongue at the baby the baby wagged her tongue back babies are born two interpenetrating two moms minds and to download what they find they're models of how to understand reality in the United States fifty-five percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people and those people have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict was 77 percent accuracy at age 18 months who was gonna graduate from high school based on who had good attachment with mom 20 percent of kids do not have those relationships they are what we call avoidant lis attached they have trouble relating to other people they go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind wanting to get close to people but not really having models of how to do that and so this is one skill of how to Hoover up knowledge one from another a second skill is equipoise the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind so for example we are overconfidence machines 95% of our professors report that they are above average teachers 96% of college students say they have above-average social skills Time magazine asked Americans are you in the top 1% of earners 19% of Americans are in the top 1% this is a gender linked trait by the way men drown at twice the rate as women because men think they can swim across that lake but some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases their own overconfidence they have a pistola logical modesty they are open-minded in the face of ambiguity they are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence they are curious and these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ the third trade is Metis what we might call street smarts it's a Greek word it's a sensitivity to the physical environment the ability to pick out patterns in an environment derive a gist one of my colleagues at The Times did a great story about soldiers in Iraq who could look down the street and detect somehow whether there was an ie D Al and mind in the street they couldn't tell you how they did it but they could feel cold they felt a coldness and they were more often right than wrong the third is what might call sympathy the ability to work within groups and that comes in tremendously handy because groups are smarter than individuals and face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically because 90% of our communication is nonverbal and the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group it's determined by how well they communicate how often they take terms and conversations then you could talk about it Oh trait like blending any child can say I'm a tiger pretend to be a tiger it seems so Elementary but in fact it's phenomenally complicated to take a concept I and a concept tiger and them together but this is the source of innovation what Picasso did for example was take the concept western art and the concept African masks and blend them together not only the geometry but the moral systems entailed in them and these are skills again we can't count and measure and then the final thing I'll mention is something you might call limerence and this is not an ability it's a drive and a motivation the conscious mind hungers for success and prestige the unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task when a craftsman feels lost in his craft when a naturalist feels at one with nature when a believer feels at one with God's love that is what the unconscious mind hungers for and many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused and one of the most beautiful description I've come across in this research of how Minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named Douglas Hofstadter's at the University of Indiana he was married to a woman named Carol and made a wonderful relationship when their kids were five and two Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly and Hofstadter wrote a book called I am a strange loop in the course of that book he describes a moment just months after Carol has died he comes across her picture on the mantle or on a bureau in his bedroom and here's what he wrote I looked at her face and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes and all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed that's me that's me and those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before about the fusion of our souls into one higher-level entity about the fact that the core of both our souls they are identical hopes and dreams for our children about the notion that those hopes were not separate and distinct hopes but were just one hope one clear thing that defined us both that welded us into a unit the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children I realized that though Carol had died that core piece of her had not died at all but had it lived on very determinately in my brain the Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom through his suffering Hofstetter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are through the policy failures of last 30 years we have come to acknowledge I think how shallow our view of human nature has been and now as we confront that challenge us and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are comes this revolution in consciousness these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted this new humanism and when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious it had a vast effect on the climate of the times now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious of who we are deep inside and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture thank you

two Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly and Hofstadter wrote a book called I am a strange loop in the course of that book he describes a moment just months after Carol has died he comes across her picture on the mantle or on a bureau in his bedroom and here's what he wrote I looked at her face and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes and all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed that's me that's me and those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before about the fusion of our souls into one higher-level entity about the fact that the core of both our souls they are identical hopes and dreams for our children about the notion that those hopes were not separate and distinct hopes but were just one hope one clear thing that defined us both that welded us into a unit the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children I realized that though Carol had died that core piece of her had not died at all but had it lived on very determinately in my brain the Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom through his suffering Hofstetter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are through the policy failures of last 30 years we have come to acknowledge I think how shallow our view of human nature has been and now as we confront that challenge us and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are comes this revolution in consciousness these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted this new humanism and when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious it had a vast effect on the climate of the times now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious of who we are deep inside and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture thank you

**Transcript**:
and I got my current job I was given a good piece of advice which was to interview three politicians every day and from that much contact with politicians I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another they have what I call logorrhea dementia which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane but what they do have is incredible social skills when you meet them they lock into you they look you in the eye they invade your personal space they massage the back of your head I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal squeezing it I once this was years ago I saw a Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate and they were friends and they hugged each other and they were laughing and their faces were like this far apart and they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other and I was like get a room I don't want to see this but they have those social skills at another case last election cycle I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons bit chip rip zip lip and dip and and he's going into a diner and he goes to the diner introduce himself to a family and says what village are you from in New Hampshire and then he described the home he owned in their village and then he so he goes around the room and then as he's leaving the diner he first names almost everybody he's just met I was like okay that's social skill but the paradox is when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode that social awareness vanishes and they tart talking about like accountants so in the course of my career I've covered a series of failures we sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up and what they really lacked was social trust we invaded Iraq with the military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities we had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn't do anything stupid for 30 years I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureau edek boxes charters private schools vouchers but we've had disappointing results year after year and the fact is people learn from people they love and if you're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student you're not talking about that reality but that reality is expunged from our policymaking process and so that's led to a question for me why are the most socially attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy and I came to the conclusion this is a symptom of a larger problem that for centuries we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that were divided selves that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions and it's led to a view of human nature that were rational individuals who respond and straightforward ways to incentives and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is and it's produced a great amputation a shallow view of human nature we're really good at talking about material things but we're really bad at talking about emotions we're really good at talking about skills and safety and health were really bad at talking about character Allister McIntyre the famous philosopher said that we have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue on or goodness but we no longer have a system by which to connect them and so this has led to a shallow path and politics but also in a whole range of human endeavors you can see it in the way we raise our young kids you go to an elementary school at 3:00 in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out and they're wearing these eighty pound backpacks that if the wind blows them over they're like beetles stuck there on the ground you see these cars that drive up usually it's sobs and Audi's in Volvo's because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car so long as it comes from a country hostile to US foreign policy that's fine they get picked up by these creatures I've called uber moms who are highly successful career women who've taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard and you can usually tell the uber moms because they actually weigh less than their own children so at the moment of conception they're doing little butt exercises the babies plop out they're flashing Mandarin flashcards with the things driving them home and they wanted to be enlightened so they take them to Ben & Jerry's ice cream company with its own foreign policy and one of my books I joke that Ben and Jerry's should make a passive his toothpaste doesn't kill germs just ask them to leave be a big seller and then they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula and you know Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International they buy we buy these seaweed based snacks they're called veggie booty with kale which is their kids at home home and say mom mom I want to snack that a whole prevent colon rectal cancer and so the kids are raised in a certain way jumping through achievement hopes are the things we can measure SAT prep OBO soccer practice they get into competitive colleges they get good jobs and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a superficial manner and they make a ton of money and sometimes you can see them at vacation places like Jackson Hole or Aspen and they're they've become elegant and slender they don't really have thighs they just have one elegant calf on top of another they have kids of their own and they've sort of achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people so their grand moms look like Gertrude Stein their daughters look like Halle Berry I don't know how they've done that they get there and they realize that they it's fashionable now to have dogs 1/3 as tall as your ceiling heights so they've got these furries 160 pound dogs look like velociraptors all named after Jane Austen characters and then when they get old they haven't really developed a philosophy of life but they've decided that I've been successful at everything I'm just not going to die and so they hire personal trainers they're popping cialis like breath mints you see them on the mountains up there they're cross-country ski up the mountain with these grim expressions that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis and sort of as they whizzed by you it's like being passed by a little iron raisinet going up the hill and so this is part of what life is but it's not all of what life is and over the past few years I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are and it's not based on theology or philosophy it's in the study of the mind across all these spheres of research from neuroscience the cognitive science behavioral economists psychologists sociology we're developing a revolution in consciousness and when you synthesize it all it's giving us a new view of human nature and far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature it's a new humanism it's a new enchantment and I think when you synthesize this research you start with three key insights the first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species the unconscious mind does most of the work and so one way to formulate that assists the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute of which can be consciously aware of about 40 and this leads to oddities one of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists people named Lawrence become lawyers because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar which is why I've named my daughter President of the United States Brooks another finding is that the unconscious far from being dumb and sexualized it's actually quite smart so one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture it's really hard to imagine a sofa how it's gonna look in your house and the way you should do that is sort of study the furniture let it marinate in your mind distract yourself and then a few days later go with your gut because unconsciously you've figured it out the second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking people with strokes and lesions in the emotion processing parts of the brain are not super smart they're actually quite sometimes quite helpless and the giant in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning Antonio Damasio and one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value and so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom now I'm a middle-aged guy I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions one of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys they put him into a brain scan machine this is apocryphal by the way but I don't care and it and they have them watch a horror movie and then they had some them describe their feelings toward their wives and the the brain scans were identical in both activities it was just sheer terror so me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony but it is the central organizing process of the way we think it tells us what to imprint a brain is the record of the feelings of a life and the third insight is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals we're social animals not rational animals we emerge out of relationships and we are deeply interpenetrated one with another and so when we see another person we reenact on our own minds what we see in their minds when we watch a car chase in a movie we it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase when we watch pornography it's a little like having sex though probably not as good and you see this in when lovers walk down the street when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion the deep interpenetrate and this revolution and who we are gives us a different way of seeing I think politics a different way most importantly of seeing human capital we are now children of the French enlightenment we believe that reason is the highest of the faculties but I think this research shows that the British enlightenment of the Scottish enlightenment with David Hume Adam Smith actually had a better handle on who we are that reason is often weak our sentiments are strong and our sentiments are often trustworthy and this works corrects that bias in our culture that dehumanizing bias it gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life when we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily things like grades SATs degrees the number of year and for schooling what it really takes to do well to leave a meaningful life are things that are deeper things we don't really even have words for and so let me list just a couple of things I think this research points us toward trying to understand the first gift our talent is mind-sight the ability to enter into other people's minds and learn what they have to offer babies come with this ability meltzoff who's at the University of Washington leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old he wagged his tongue at the baby the baby wagged her tongue back babies are born two interpenetrating two moms minds and to download what they find they're models of how to understand reality in the United States fifty-five percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people and those people have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict was 77 percent accuracy at age 18 months who was gonna graduate from high school based on who had good attachment with mom 20 percent of kids do not have those relationships they are what we call avoidant lis attached they have trouble relating to other people they go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind wanting to get close to people but not really having models of how to do that and so this is one skill of how to Hoover up knowledge one from another a second skill is equipoise the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind so for example we are overconfidence machines 95% of our professors report that they are above average teachers 96% of college students say they have above-average social skills Time magazine asked Americans are you in the top 1% of earners 19% of Americans are in the top 1% this is a gender linked trait by the way men drown at twice the rate as women because men think they can swim across that lake but some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases their own overconfidence they have a pistola logical modesty they are open-minded in the face of ambiguity they are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence they are curious and these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ the third trade is Metis what we might call street smarts it's a Greek word it's a sensitivity to the physical environment the ability to pick out patterns in an environment derive a gist one of my colleagues at The Times did a great story about soldiers in Iraq who could look down the street and detect somehow whether there was an ie D Al and mind in the street they couldn't tell you how they did it but they could feel cold they felt a coldness and they were more often right than wrong the third is what might call sympathy the ability to work within groups and that comes in tremendously handy because groups are smarter than individuals and face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically because 90% of our communication is nonverbal and the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group it's determined by how well they communicate how often they take terms and conversations then you could talk about it Oh trait like blending any child can say I'm a tiger pretend to be a tiger it seems so Elementary but in fact it's phenomenally complicated to take a concept I and a concept tiger and them together but this is the source of innovation what Picasso did for example was take the concept western art and the concept African masks and blend them together not only the geometry but the moral systems entailed in them and these are skills again we can't count and measure and then the final thing I'll mention is something you might call limerence and this is not an ability it's a drive and a motivation the conscious mind hungers for success and prestige the unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task when a craftsman feels lost in his craft when a naturalist feels at one with nature when a believer feels at one with God's love that is what the unconscious mind hungers for and many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused and one of the most beautiful description I've come across in this research of how Minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named Douglas Hofstadter's at the University of Indiana he was married to a woman named Carol and made a wonderful relationship when their kids were five and two Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly and Hofstadter wrote a book called I am a strange loop in the course of that book he describes a moment just months after Carol has died he comes across her picture on the mantle or on a bureau in his bedroom and here's what he wrote I looked at her face and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes and all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed that's me that's me and those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before about the fusion of our souls into one higher-level entity about the fact that the core of both our souls they are identical hopes and dreams for our children about the notion that those hopes were not separate and distinct hopes but were just one hope one clear thing that defined us both that welded us into a unit the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children I realized that though Carol had died that core piece of her had not died at all but had it lived on very determinately in my brain the Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom through his suffering Hofstetter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are through the policy

Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious it had a vast effect on the climate of the times now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious of who we are deep inside and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture thank you

it's not based on theology or philosophy it's in the study of the mind across all these spheres of research from neuroscience the cognitive science behavioral economists psychologists sociology we're developing a revolution in consciousness and when you synthesize it all it's giving us a new view of human nature and far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature it's a new humanism it's a new enchantment and I think when you synthesize this research you start with three key insights the first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species the unconscious mind does most of the work and so one way to formulate that assists the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute of which can be consciously aware of about 40 and this leads to oddities one of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists people named Lawrence become lawyers because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar which is why I've named my daughter President of the United States Brooks another finding is that the unconscious far from being dumb and sexualized it's actually quite smart so one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture it's really hard to imagine a sofa how it's gonna look in your house and the way you should do that is sort of study the furniture let it marinate in your mind distract yourself and then a few days later go with your gut because unconsciously you've figured it out the second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking people with strokes and lesions in the emotion processing parts of the brain are not super smart they're actually quite sometimes quite helpless and the giant in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning Antonio Damasio and one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value and so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom now I'm a middle-aged guy I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions one of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys they put him into a brain scan machine this is apocryphal by the way but I don't care and it and they have them watch a horror movie and then they had some them describe their feelings toward their wives and the the brain scans were identical in both activities it was just sheer terror so me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony but it is the central organizing process of the way we think it tells us what to imprint a brain is the record of the feelings of a life and the third insight is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals we're social animals not rational animals we emerge out of relationships and we are deeply interpenetrated one with another and so when we see another person we reenact on our own minds what we see in their minds when we watch a car chase in a movie we it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase when we watch pornography it's a little like having sex though probably not as good and you see this in when lovers walk down the street when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion the deep interpenetrate and this revolution and who we are gives us a different way of seeing I think politics a different way most importantly of seeing human capital we are now children of the French enlightenment we believe that reason is the highest of the faculties but I think this research shows that the British enlightenment of the Scottish enlightenment with David Hume Adam Smith actually had a better handle on who we are that reason is often weak our sentiments are strong and our sentiments are often trustworthy and this works corrects that bias in our culture that dehumanizing bias it gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life when we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily things like grades SATs degrees the number of year and for schooling what it really takes to do well to leave a meaningful life are things that are deeper things we don't really even have words for and so let me list just a couple of things I think this research points us toward trying to understand the first gift our talent is mind-sight the ability to enter into other people's minds and learn what they have to offer babies come with this ability meltzoff who's at the University of Washington leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old he wagged his tongue at the baby the baby wagged her tongue back babies are born two interpenetrating two moms minds and to download what they find they're models of how to understand reality in the United States fifty-five percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people and those people have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict was 77 percent accuracy at age 18 months who was gonna graduate from high school based on who had good attachment with mom 20 percent of kids do not have those relationships they are what we call avoidant lis attached they have trouble relating to other people they go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind wanting to get close to people but not really having models of how to do that and so this is one skill of how to Hoover up knowledge one from another a second skill is equipoise the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind so for example we are overconfidence machines 95% of our professors report that they are above average teachers 96% of college students say they have above-average social skills Time magazine asked Americans are you in the top 1% of earners 19% of Americans are in the top 1% this is a gender linked trait by the way men drown at twice the rate as women because men think they can swim across that lake but some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases their own overconfidence they have a pistola logical modesty they are open-minded in the face of ambiguity they are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence they are curious and these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ the third trade is Metis what we might call street smarts it's a Greek word it's a sensitivity to the physical environment the ability to pick out patterns in an environment derive a gist one of my colleagues at The Times did a great story about soldiers in Iraq who could look down the street and detect somehow whether there was an ie D Al and mind in the street they couldn't tell you how they did it but they could feel cold they felt a coldness and they were more often right than wrong the third is what might call sympathy the ability to work within groups and that comes in tremendously handy because groups are smarter than individuals and face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically because 90% of our communication is nonverbal and the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group it's determined by how well they communicate how often they take terms and conversations then you could talk about it Oh trait like blending any child can say I'm a tiger pretend to be a tiger it seems so Elementary but in fact it's phenomenally complicated to take a concept I and a concept tiger and them together but this is the source of innovation what Picasso did for example was take the concept western art and the concept African masks and blend them together not only the geometry but the moral systems entailed in them and these are skills again we can't count and measure and then the final thing I'll mention is something you might call limerence and this is not an ability it's a drive and a motivation the conscious mind hungers for success and prestige the unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task when a craftsman feels lost in his craft when a naturalist feels at one with nature when a believer feels at one with God's love that is what the unconscious mind hungers for and many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused and one of the most beautiful description I've come across in this research of how Minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named Douglas Hofstadter's at the University of Indiana he was married to a woman named Carol and made a wonderful relationship when their kids were five and two Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly and Hofstadter wrote a book called I am a strange loop in the course of that book he describes a moment just months after Carol has died he comes across her picture on the mantle or on a bureau in his bedroom and here's what he wrote I looked at her face and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes and all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed that's me that's me and those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before about the fusion of our souls into one higher-level entity about the fact that the core of both our souls they are identical hopes and dreams for our children about the notion that those hopes were not separate and distinct hopes but were just one hope one clear thing that defined us both that welded us into a unit the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children I realized that though Carol had died that core piece of her had not died at all but had it lived on very determinately in my brain the Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom through his suffering Hofstetter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are through the policy failures of last 30 years we have come to acknowledge I think how shallow our view of human nature has been and now as we confront that challenge us and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are comes this revolution in consciousness these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted this new humanism and when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious it had a vast effect on the climate of the times now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious of who we are deep inside and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture thank you

**Transcript**:
and I got my current job I was given a good piece of advice which was to interview three politicians every day and from that much contact with politicians I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another they have what I call logorrhea dementia which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane but what they do have is incredible social skills when you meet them they lock into you they look you in the eye they invade your personal space they massage the back of your head I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal squeezing it I once this was years ago I saw a Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate and they were friends and they hugged each other and they were laughing and their faces were like this far apart and they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other and I was like get a room I don't want to see this but they have those social skills at another case last election cycle I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons bit chip rip zip lip and dip and and he's going into a diner and he goes to the diner introduce himself to a family and says what village are you from in New Hampshire and then he described the home he owned in their village and then he so he goes around the room and then as he's leaving the diner he first names almost everybody he's just met I was like okay that's social skill but the paradox is when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode that social awareness vanishes and they tart talking about like accountants so in the course of my career I've covered a series of failures we sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up and what they really lacked was social trust we invaded Iraq with the military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities we had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn't do anything stupid for 30 years I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureau edek boxes charters private schools vouchers but we've had disappointing results year after year and the fact is people learn from people they love and if you're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student you're not talking about that reality but that reality is expunged from our policymaking process and so that's led to a question for me why are the most socially attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy and I came to the conclusion this is a symptom of a larger problem that for centuries we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that were divided selves that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions and it's led to a view of human nature that were rational individuals who respond and straightforward ways to incentives and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is and it's produced a great amputation a shallow view of human nature we're really good at talking about material things but we're really bad at talking about emotions we're really good at talking about skills and safety and health were really bad at talking about character Allister McIntyre the famous philosopher said that we have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue on or goodness but we no longer have a system by which to connect them and so this has led to a shallow path and politics but also in a whole range of human endeavors you can see it in the way we raise our young kids you go to an elementary school at 3:00 in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out and they're wearing these eighty pound backpacks that if the wind blows them over they're like beetles stuck there on the ground you see these cars that drive up usually it's sobs and Audi's in Volvo's because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car so long as it comes from a country hostile to US foreign policy that's fine they get picked up by these creatures I've called uber moms who are highly successful career women who've taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard and you can usually tell the uber moms because they actually weigh less than their own children so at the moment of conception they're doing little butt exercises the babies plop out they're flashing Mandarin flashcards with the things driving them home and they wanted to be enlightened so they take them to Ben & Jerry's ice cream company with its own foreign policy and one of my books I joke that Ben and Jerry's should make a passive his toothpaste doesn't kill germs just ask them to leave be a big seller and then they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula and you know Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International they buy we buy these seaweed based snacks they're called veggie booty with kale which is their kids at home home and say mom mom I want to snack that a whole prevent colon rectal cancer and so the kids are raised in a certain way jumping through achievement hopes are the things we can measure SAT prep OBO soccer practice they get into competitive colleges they get good jobs and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a superficial manner and they make a ton of money and sometimes you can see them at vacation places like Jackson Hole or Aspen and they're they've become elegant and slender they don't really have thighs they just have one elegant calf on top of another they have kids of their own and they've sort of achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people so their grand moms look like Gertrude Stein their daughters look like Halle Berry I don't know how they've done that they get there and they realize that they it's fashionable now to have dogs 1/3 as tall as your ceiling heights so they've got these furries 160 pound dogs look like velociraptors all named after Jane Austen characters and then when they get old they haven't really developed a philosophy of life but they've decided that I've been successful at everything I'm just not going to die and so they hire personal trainers they're popping cialis like breath mints you see them on the mountains up there they're cross-country ski up the mountain with these grim expressions that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis and sort of as they whizzed by you it's like being passed by a little iron raisinet going up the hill and so this is part of what life is but it's not all of what life is and over the past few years I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are and

[Music] [Applause] KH Academy is most known for its its collection of videos so before I go any further uh let me show you a little bit of a a montage so the hypotenuse is now going to be five this animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America a nice clean band here and this part of Africa we could integrate over the surface and the notation usually is a capital Sigma National Assembly they create the Committee of Public Safety which sounds like a very nice committee notice this is an alahh and it's an alcohol start differentiating into a fector and memory cells a Galaxy hey there's another galaxy oh look there's another galaxy and for dollars is their 30 million plus the $20 million from the American manufacturer if this does not blow your mind then you have no emotion we now have on the order of of of 2200 videos covering everything from basic arithmetic all the way to to to Vector calculus and some of the stuff that that you saw up there uh we have a million students a month using the site watching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day uh uh but what we're going to talk about in this is is is how we're going to the next level uh but before I I do that I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started and uh some some of y'all might know about five years ago I was an analyst at a hedge fund and I was in Boston and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans remotely and I started putting the First YouTube videos up really just as kind of a nice to have just kind of a supplement for my cousin something that might you know give give or a fresher or something and as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up something interesting happened actually a bunch of interesting things happened the first was the feedback from my cousins they told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person and and and once once you get over the backhanded nature of that there was actually something very profound there they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin at first it's very unintuitive but when you actually think about it from their point of view it makes a ton of sense you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin now they can without feeling like they're wasting my time they could if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago or maybe a couple of years ago uh they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if they're bored they can go ahead they can watch it at their own time at their own pace and probably the the the least appreciated uh I guess aspect of of this is the notion that the very first time the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around A New Concept the very last thing you need is another human being saying do you understand this and that's what was happening with the the interaction with my cousins before and now they could just do it kind of in in kind of in the intimacy of their of their of their own room the other thing that happened is is you know I put them on YouTube just just you know for for the you know I I I saw no reason to make it private so I I let other people watch it and and then people started stumbling on it and and I started getting some comments and some letters and and all sorts of kind of feedback from from random people around the world and you know these are just a few this is actually from one of the original calculus videos and someone wrote just on YouTube it was a YouTube comment first time I smiled doing a derivative and's let's let's pause here this person did a derivative and then they smiled and then in response to that same comment this is on the thread you could go on YouTube and and look at these comments someone else wrote same thing here I actually got a natural high in a good mood for the entire day since I remember seeing all of this Matrix text in class and here I'm all like I know Kung Fu and we got a lot of feedback along those lines you know it's clearly it was helping people but then as as the viewership kept growing and kept growing I I started getting letters from from people and it was it was starting to become clear that it was actually more than just a knife to have uh this is just an except from one of one of those letters uh my 12-year-old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math we have tried everything viewed everything bought everything we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through then we went onto the dreaded fractions again he got it we could not believe it he is so excited and so you can imagine you know here I was a uh an analyst at a hedge fund I it was very strange for me to do something of social value I was I was but uh I I I was excited so I kept going and then a few things other things started to dawn on me that Not only would it help my cousins right now or these people who are sending letters but it could maybe that this content will never go old that it could help their kids or their grandkids if Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus I wouldn't have to ass assum assuming he was good I we don't know uh the other thing that happened you know even at this point you know I said okay maybe it's a good supplement it's good for Motivated students it's good for maybe homeschoolers but I didn't think it would be something that would somehow penetrate the classroom but then I started getting letters from teachers and the teachers would write saying we've used your videos to flip the classroom you've given the lectures so now what we do and this could actually happen in every classroom in America tomorrow what I do is I assign the lectures for homework and what used to be homework I now have the students doing in the classroom and I want to I want to pause here for I I want to pause here for a second because there's a couple of interesting things one when those when those teachers are doing that there's there's the obvious benefit there's the the benefit that now their their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did they can pause repeat at their own pace uh at their own time but the more interesting thing this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom by removing the one- siiz fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home and then when you go to the classroom letting them do work having the Stu the teacher walk around having the peers actually be able to interact with each other these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience a bunch of 30 kids with their fingers on their lips not allowed to interact with each other a teacher no matter how good has to give this kind of one- siiz fists all lecture to 30 students you know blank faces slightly antagonistic and now it's a human experience now they're actually in interacting with each other so once the KH Academy kind of you know I I quit my job and and and we turned into a real organization were not for profit um the question is how do we take this to uh the next level how do we take what those teachers were doing to their natural conclusion and so what I'm showing over here these are actual uh exercises that I started writing for my cousins uh the ones I started were much more primitive this is a kind of a a more competent version of it but the paradigm here is we'll we we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept until you get 10 in a row and the the the Con Academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you don't know how to do it but the Paradigm here it seems like a very simple thing 10 in a row you move on but it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right right now in a in a traditional classroom you have a couple of uh homework homework lecture homework lecture and then you have a snapshot exam and that exam whether you get a 70% an 80% a 90% % or 95% the class moves on to the next topic and even that that that 95% student what was the 5% they didn't know maybe they didn't know what what happens when you raise something to the to the zeroth power and then you go build on that in the next concept that's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle and I give you a bicycle maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time and and I give you that that bicycle for two weeks and then I come back after two weeks and I say well let's see you're having trouble taking left turns you can't quite stop you're you're an 80% bicyclist so I put a big c stamp on your forehead and then I say here's a unicycle but as ridiculous as that sounds that's exactly what's happening in in our in our in our classrooms right now and and and the idea is you know you you fast forward and students start good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing uh calculus all of a sudden despite being smart despite having good teachers and it's usually because they had these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation so our our model is learn math the way you would learn anything like the way you would learn a bicycle stay on that bicycle fall off that bicycle do it as long as necessary until you have Mastery the traditional model it penalizes you for experimentation and failure but it does not expect Mastery we encourage you to experiment we encourage you to failure but we do expect Mastery this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry this is Shifting and reflecting functions and and they all fit together we have we have about 90 of these right now and and you could go to the site right now it's all free not not trying to sell anything but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map that top node right there that's literally singled digigit addition it's like 1+ one is equal to two and the Paradigm is once you get 10 in a row on that then it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules so if you keep so it keep this is go further down the knowledge map we're getting into more advanced arithmetic further down you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra further down you start getting into uh Algebra 1 Algebra 2 a little bit of pre-calculus and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on is from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of okay if you know this and that now you're ready for this next concept now that can work well for an individual learner you know and I one for you to do it with your kids but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it'll it'll change what happens at the dinner table but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about and so what I'm showing you here this is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos School District where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren't using textbooks they're not getting one siiz fits-all lectures they're doing KH Academy they're doing that software for roughly half of their math class and I want to make it clear we don't view this as the complete math education what it does is and this is what's happening in Los Altos it frees up time this is the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to a system of equations and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the Mechanics for the for the robot building for for the estimating how high that Hill is based on its on its shadow and so the Paradigm is the teacher walks in every day every kid works at their own base and a teacher get this is actually a live dashboard from Los Alto school district and they look at this dashboard every row is a student every column is one of those Concepts green means the students already proficient blue means that they're working on it no need to worry red means they're stuck and what the teacher does is literally just says let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their their peer now I kind of come from a very data Centric reality so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions oh what do you not understand or what do you do understand and all of the rest so our Paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible really data that in almost any other field is expected if you're in finance or marketing or manufacturing and so the teachers can actually diagnose what's wrong with the students so that they can make their interaction as productive as possible so now the teachers know exactly what the students been up to how long they've been spending every day what videos have they been watching when did they pause the videos what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they been focused on the Outer Circle shows what the exercises they're focused on the inner circle shows the videos they're focused on and the data gets pretty granular so you can actually see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong red is wrong blue is right the leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted they watched the video right over there and then you could see eventually they were able to get 10 in a row it's almost like you can almost see them learning over those last 10 problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them so you know when you talk about self-paced learning it makes sense for everyone you know in education speak differentiated learning but it's kind of crazy what happens when you actually see it in a classroom because every every time we've done this in every classroom we've done over and over again if you go five days into it there's a group of kids who've raised ahead and there's a group of kids who are a little bit slower and in a traditional model if you did a snapshot assessment you say oh these are the gifted kids these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes but when you let every student work at their own pace and we see it over and over and over again you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago you now would think are gifted and we're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder uh kind of how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from uh really just due to a a coincidence of time now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos um our goal is is to use technology to humanize not just in Los Altos but kind of on a global scale well what's happening in education and actually that that kind of brings an interesting point is you know a lot of the effort in in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our mind the relevant metric is student to valuable human time with the teacher ratio so in a traditional model most of the teacher time is spent doing lectures and Grading tests and and and whatnot maybe 5% of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them now 100% of their time is so once again using technology not just flipping the classroom you're humanizing the classroom I'd argue by by a by a factor of five or 10 and as valuable as it is in Los Altos imagine what that does to the adult learner who's embarrassed to go back and and learn stuff that they should have known before before going back to college imagine imagine what it does to a kid a street kid in Kolkata who has to help his family during the day and that's the reason why he or she can't go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or or or or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or or don't know now imagine what happens where you know we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom but this is all one system there's no reason why you can't have that that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom imagine what happens if that student in Kolkata all of a sudden can tutor your son or your son can tutor that kid in Kolkata and I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of of a global One World classroom and that's that's essentially what we're what we're trying to build thank you I ask question time okay I've I've seen some things you're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback energy points merit badges tell me uh what what you're thinking there oh yeah no we we have an awesome team working on it's not and I have to make it clear it's not just me anymore I'm still doing all the videos we have a kind of a rockstar team doing the software um yeah we've put a bunch of game mechanics in there you get these badges we're going to start having leaderboards by areas and you get point it's actually been pretty interesting just the wording of the badging or or how many points you get for doing something we see on a systemwide basis like tens of thousands of like fifth graders or sixth graders going One Direction or another depending on what you know B badge you give them and the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos how how did that come about yeah no Los Altos been kind of it was kind of crazy they they once again I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms uh someone from from their board came and said oh what would you do if you had cart block launch in a classroom and I said well you know I would just every student work at their own pace on something like this we'd give a dashboard you know and they said oh this is kind of radical we have to think about it and uh me and the rest of the team like oh you know they're never going to want to do this uh uh but literally the next day they're like can you can you start in two weeks and so so it's fifth fifth grade math is where that's going on right now it's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and I think they're doing at the district level I think what they're excited about is they can now follow these kids it's not an only in school thing I mean we've even you know on Christmas we saw some of the kids were doing and we can track everything so they can actually track them as they go through the entire District through the Summers as they go from one teacher to an next you have this continuity of of of data that that even at the district level they can see so some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those those kids so you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they they think they need oh yeah actually most of those were were kind of specs by the teachers we made some of those four students so they could see their data but you know we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves and they're literally saying hey you know this is nice but I like that Focus graph a lot of students say a lot of the teachers said I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus a diagram for them so it's all been teacher-driven it's it's been it's been pretty crazy is this ready for prime time do you think a lot of class classes next school year should try this thing out yeah it's ready it's you know it's uh we got a million people on the side already so we can handle a few more and uh it's uh it's a no no reason why why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow and the the vision of the tutoring thing the idea there is if I'm confused about a topic somehow right in user interface I'd find people who are volunteering maybe see their reputation and I could schedule and connect up with those people absolutely you know and this is something that I recommend everyone in this audience to do is you can that those dashboards that teachers have you can go log in right now and you could get you can essentially become a coach for your for your your kids your nephews your cousins or or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club um and yeah you you can start becoming a mentor or tutor really really immediately but uh yeah yeah it's all there well it's amazing I I think you just got a glimpse of the future of Education thank you oh thank you [Music]

we encourage you to failure but we do expect Mastery this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry this is Shifting and reflecting functions and and they all fit together we have we have about 90 of these right now and and you could go to the site right now it's all free not not trying to sell anything but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map that top node right there that's literally singled digigit addition it's like 1+ one is equal to two and the Paradigm is once you get 10 in a row on that then it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules so if you keep so it keep this is go further down the knowledge map we're getting into more advanced arithmetic further down you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra further down you start getting into uh Algebra 1 Algebra 2 a little bit of pre-calculus and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on is from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of okay if you know this and that now you're ready for this next concept now that can work well for an individual learner you know and I one for you to do it with your kids but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it'll it'll change what happens at the dinner table but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about and so what I'm showing you here this is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos School District where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren't using textbooks they're not getting one siiz fits-all lectures they're doing KH Academy they're doing that software for roughly half of their math class and I want to make it clear we don't view this as the complete math education what it does is and this is what's happening in Los Altos it frees up time this is the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to a system of equations and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the Mechanics for the for the robot building for for the estimating how high that Hill is based on its on its shadow and so the Paradigm is the teacher walks in every day every kid works at their own base and a teacher get this is actually a live dashboard from Los Alto school district and they look at this dashboard every row is a student every column is one of those Concepts green means the students already proficient blue means that they're working on it no need to worry red means they're stuck and what the teacher does is literally just says let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their their peer now I kind of come from a very data Centric reality so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions oh what do you not understand or what do you do understand and all of the rest so our Paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible really data that in almost any other field is expected if you're in finance or marketing or manufacturing and so the teachers can actually diagnose what's wrong with the students so that they can make their interaction as productive as possible so now the teachers know exactly what the students been up to how long they've been spending every day what videos have they been watching when did they pause the videos what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they been focused on the Outer Circle shows what the exercises they're focused on the inner circle shows the videos they're focused on and the data gets pretty granular so you can actually see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong red is wrong blue is right the leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted they watched the video right over there and then you could see eventually they were able to get 10 in a row it's almost like you can almost see them learning over those last 10 problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them so you know when you talk about self-paced learning it makes sense for everyone you know in education speak differentiated learning but it's kind of crazy what happens when you actually see it in a classroom because every every time we've done this in every classroom we've done over and over again if you go five days into it there's a group of kids who've raised ahead and there's a group of kids who are a little bit slower and in a traditional model if you did a snapshot assessment you say oh these are the gifted kids these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes but when you let every student work at their own pace and we see it over and over and over again you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago you now would think are gifted and we're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder uh kind of how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from uh really just due to a a coincidence of time now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos um our goal is is to use technology to humanize not just in Los Altos but kind of on a global scale well what's happening in education and actually that that kind of brings an interesting point is you know a lot of the effort in in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our mind the relevant metric is student to valuable human time with the teacher ratio so in a traditional model most of the teacher time is spent doing lectures and Grading tests and and and whatnot maybe 5% of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them now 100% of their time is so once again using technology not just flipping the classroom you're humanizing the classroom I'd argue by by a by a factor of five or 10 and as valuable as it is in Los Altos imagine what that does to the adult learner who's embarrassed to go back and and learn stuff that they should have known before before going back to college imagine imagine what it does to a kid a street kid in Kolkata who has to help his family during the day and that's the reason why he or she can't go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or or or or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or or don't know now imagine what happens where you know we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom but this is all one system there's no reason why you can't have that that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom imagine what happens if that student in Kolkata all of a sudden can tutor your son or your son can tutor that kid in Kolkata and I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of of a global One World classroom and that's that's essentially what we're what we're trying to build thank you I ask question time okay I've I've seen some things you're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback energy points merit badges tell me uh what what you're thinking there oh yeah no we we have an awesome team working on it's not and I have to make it clear it's not just me anymore I'm still doing all the videos we have a kind of a rockstar team doing the software um yeah we've put a bunch of game mechanics in there you get these badges we're going to start having leaderboards by areas and you get point it's actually been pretty interesting just the wording of the badging or or how many points you get for doing something we see on a systemwide basis like tens of thousands of like fifth graders or sixth graders going One Direction or another depending on what you know B badge you give them and the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos how how did that come about yeah no Los Altos been kind of it was kind of crazy they they once again I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms uh someone from from their board came and said oh what would you do if you had cart block launch in a classroom and I said well you know I would just every student work at their own pace on something like this we'd give a dashboard you know and they said oh this is kind of radical we have to think about it and uh me and the rest of the team like oh you know they're never going to want to do this uh uh but literally the next day they're like can you can you start in two weeks and so so it's fifth fifth grade math is where that's going on right now it's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and I think they're doing at the district level I think what they're excited about is they can now follow these kids it's not an only in school thing I mean we've even you know on Christmas we saw some of the kids were doing and we can track everything so they can actually track them as they go through the entire District through the Summers as they go from one teacher to an next you have this continuity of of of data that that even at the district level they can see so some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those those kids so you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they they think they need oh yeah actually most of those were were kind of specs by the teachers we made some of those four students so they could see their data but you know we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves and they're literally saying hey you know this is nice but I like that Focus graph a lot of students say a lot of the teachers said I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus a diagram for them so it's all been teacher-driven it's it's been it's been pretty crazy is this ready for prime time do you think a lot of class classes next school year should try this thing out yeah it's ready it's you know it's uh we got a million people on the side already so we can handle a few more and uh it's uh it's a no no reason why why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow and the the vision of the tutoring thing the idea there is if I'm confused about a topic somehow right in user interface I'd find people who are volunteering maybe see their reputation and I could schedule and connect up with those people absolutely you know and this is something that I recommend everyone in this audience to do is you can that those dashboards that teachers have you can go log in right now and you could get you can essentially become a coach for your for your your kids your nephews your cousins or or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club um and yeah you you can start becoming a mentor or tutor really really immediately but uh yeah yeah it's all there well it's amazing I I think you just got a glimpse of the future of Education thank you oh thank you [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] KH Academy is most known for its its collection of videos so before I go any further uh let me show you a little bit of a a montage so the hypotenuse is now going to be five this animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America a nice clean band here and this part of Africa we could integrate over the surface and the notation usually is a capital Sigma National Assembly they create the Committee of Public Safety which sounds like a very nice committee notice this is an alahh and it's an alcohol start differentiating into a fector and memory cells a Galaxy hey there's another galaxy oh look there's another galaxy and for dollars is their 30 million plus the $20 million from the American manufacturer if this does not blow your mind then you have no emotion we now have on the order of of of 2200 videos covering everything from basic arithmetic all the way to to to Vector calculus and some of the stuff that that you saw up there uh we have a million students a month using the site watching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day uh uh but what we're going to talk about in this is is is how we're going to the next level uh but before I I do that I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started and uh some some of y'all might know about five years ago I was an analyst at a hedge fund and I was in Boston and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans remotely and I started putting the First YouTube videos up really just as kind of a nice to have just kind of a supplement for my cousin something that might you know give give or a fresher or something and as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up something interesting happened actually a bunch of interesting things happened the first was the feedback from my cousins they told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person and and and once once you get over the backhanded nature of that there was actually something very profound there they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin at first it's very unintuitive but when you actually think about it from their point of view it makes a ton of sense you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin now they can without feeling like they're wasting my time they could if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago or maybe a couple of years ago uh they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if they're bored they can go ahead they can watch it at their own time at their own pace and probably the the the least appreciated uh I guess aspect of of this is the notion that the very first time the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around A New Concept the very last thing you need is another human being saying do you understand this and that's what was happening with the the interaction with my cousins before and now they could just do it kind of in in kind of in the intimacy of their of their of their own room the other thing that happened is is you know I put them on YouTube just just you know for for the you know I I I saw no reason to make it private so I I let other people watch it and and then people started stumbling on it and and I started getting some comments and some letters and and all sorts of kind of feedback from from random people around the world and you know these are just a few this is actually from one of the original calculus videos and someone wrote just on YouTube it was a YouTube comment first time I smiled doing a derivative and's let's let's pause here this person did a derivative and then they smiled and then in response to that same comment this is on the thread you could go on YouTube and and look at these comments someone else wrote same thing here I actually got a natural high in a good mood for the entire day since I remember seeing all of this Matrix text in class and here I'm all like I know Kung Fu and we got a lot of feedback along those lines you know it's clearly it was helping people but then as as the viewership kept growing and kept growing I I started getting letters from from people and it was it was starting to become clear that it was actually more than just a knife to have uh this is just an except from one of one of those letters uh my 12-year-old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math we have tried everything viewed everything bought everything we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through then we went onto the dreaded fractions again he got it we could not believe it he is so excited and so you can imagine you know here I was a uh an analyst at a hedge fund I it was very strange for me to do something of social value I was I was but uh I I I was excited so I kept going and then a few things other things started to dawn on me that Not only would it help my cousins right now or these people who are sending letters but it could maybe that this content will never go old that it could help their kids or their grandkids if Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus I wouldn't have to ass assum assuming he was good I we don't know uh the other thing that happened you know even at this point you know I said okay maybe it's a good supplement it's good for Motivated students it's good for maybe homeschoolers but I didn't think it would be something that would somehow penetrate the classroom but then I started getting letters from teachers and the teachers would write saying we've used your videos to flip the classroom you've given the lectures so now what we do and this could actually happen in every classroom in America tomorrow what I do is I assign the lectures for homework and what used to be homework I now have the students doing in the classroom and I want to I want to pause here for I I want to pause here for a second because there's a couple of interesting things one when those when those teachers are doing that there's there's the obvious benefit there's the the benefit that now their their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did they can pause repeat at their own pace uh at their own time but the more interesting thing this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom by removing the one- siiz fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home and then when you go to the classroom letting them do work having the Stu the teacher walk around having the peers actually be able to interact with each other these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience a bunch of 30 kids with their fingers on their lips not allowed to interact with each other a teacher no matter how good has to give this kind of one- siiz fists all lecture to 30 students you know blank faces slightly antagonistic and now it's a human experience now they're actually in interacting with each other so once the KH Academy kind of you know I I quit my job and and and we turned into a real organization were not for profit um the question is how do we take this to uh the next level how do we take what those teachers were doing to their natural conclusion and so what I'm showing over here these are actual uh exercises that I started writing for my cousins uh the ones I started were much more primitive this is a kind of a a more competent version of it but the paradigm here is we'll we we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept until you get 10 in a row and the the the Con Academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you don't know how to do it but the Paradigm here it seems like a very simple thing 10 in a row you move on but it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right right now in a in a traditional classroom you have a couple of uh homework homework lecture homework lecture and then you have a snapshot exam and that exam whether you get a 70% an 80% a 90% % or 95% the class moves on to the next topic and even that that that 95% student what was the 5% they didn't know maybe they didn't know what what happens when you raise something to the to the zeroth power and then you go build on that in the next concept that's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle and I give you a bicycle maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time and and I give you that that bicycle for two weeks and then I come back after two weeks and I say well let's see you're having trouble taking left turns you can't quite stop you're you're an 80% bicyclist so I put a big c stamp on your forehead and then I say here's a unicycle but as ridiculous as that sounds that's exactly what's happening in in our in our in our classrooms right now and and and the idea is you know you you fast forward and students start good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing uh calculus all of a sudden despite being smart despite having good teachers and it's usually because they had these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation so our our model is learn math the way you would learn anything like the way you would learn a bicycle stay on that bicycle fall off that bicycle do it as long as necessary until you have Mastery the traditional model it penalizes you for experimentation and failure but it does not expect Mastery we encourage you to experiment we encourage you to failure but we do expect Mastery this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry this is Shifting and reflecting functions and and they all fit together we have we have about 90 of these right now and and you could go to the site right now it's all free not not trying to sell anything but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map that top node right there that's literally singled digigit addition it's like 1+ one is equal to two and the Paradigm is once you get 10 in a row on that then it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules so if you keep so it keep this is go further down the knowledge map we're getting into more advanced arithmetic further down you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra further down you start getting into uh Algebra 1 Algebra 2 a little bit of pre-calculus and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on is from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of okay if you know this and that now you're ready for this next concept now that can work well for an individual learner you know and I one for you to do it with your kids but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it'll it'll change what happens at the dinner table but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about and so what I'm showing you here this is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos School District where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren't using textbooks they're not getting one siiz fits-all lectures they're doing KH Academy they're doing that software for roughly half of their math class and I want to make it clear we don't view this as the complete math education what it does is and this is what's happening in Los Altos it frees up time this is the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to a system of equations and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the Mechanics for the for the robot building for for the estimating how high that Hill is based on its on its shadow and so the Paradigm is the teacher walks in every day every kid works at their own base and a teacher get this is actually a live dashboard from Los Alto school district and they look at this dashboard every row is a student every column is one of those Concepts green means the students already proficient blue means that they're working on it no need to worry red means they're stuck and what the teacher does is literally just says let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their their peer now I kind of come from a very data Centric reality so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions oh what do you not understand or what do you do understand and all of the rest so our Paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible really data that in almost any other field is expected if you're in finance or marketing or manufacturing and so the teachers can actually diagnose what's wrong with the students so that they can make their interaction as productive as possible so now the teachers know exactly what the students been up to how long they've been spending every day what videos have they been watching when did they pause the videos what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they been focused on the Outer Circle shows what the exercises they're focused on the inner circle shows the videos they're focused on and the data gets pretty granular so you can actually see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong red is wrong blue is right the leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted they watched the video right over there and then you could see eventually they were able to get 10 in a row it's almost like you can almost see them learning over those last 10 problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them so you know when you talk about self-paced learning it makes sense for everyone you know in education speak differentiated learning but it's kind of crazy what happens when you actually see it in a classroom because every every time we've done this in every classroom we've done over and over again if you go five days into it there's a group of kids who've raised ahead and there's a group of kids who are a little bit slower and in a traditional model if you did a snapshot assessment you say oh these are the gifted kids these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes but when you let every student work at their own pace and we see it over and over and over again you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago you now would think are gifted and we're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder uh kind of how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from uh really just due to a a

what's happening in education and actually that that kind of brings an interesting point is you know a lot of the effort in in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our

that's that's essentially what we're what we're trying to build thank you I ask question time okay I've I've seen some things you're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback

around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus a diagram for them so it's all been teacher-driven it's it's been it's been pretty crazy is this ready for prime time do you think a lot of class classes next school year should try this thing out yeah it's ready it's you know it's uh we got a million people on the side already so we can handle a few more and uh it's uh it's a no no reason why why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow and the the vision of the tutoring thing the idea there is if I'm confused about a topic somehow right in user interface I'd find people who are volunteering maybe see their reputation and I could schedule and connect up with those people absolutely you know and this is something that I recommend everyone in this

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 7: According to the transcript, what is the main benefit of the KH Academy's educational model for students who are struggling with a particular concept? Options: A. They will be able to keep up with their peers and avoid feeling embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, B. They will be able to receive personalized feedback and support from their teachers, C. They will be able to work at their own pace and receive extra help when they need it, D. They will be able to receive a traditional education with a focus on lectures and exams

However, the correct answer is not explicitly mentioned in the options. But the idea of working at one's own pace and receiving extra help when needed is closely related to the concept of learning math like riding a bike, where one needs to stay on the bike and keep practicing until they achieve mastery.

A more accurate match would be:

Question 3: What is the main idea behind the KH Academy's knowledge map? Options: A. To provide a hierarchical structure for learning mathematics, B. To create a framework for teaching logic and computer programming, C. To develop a system for tracking student progress and providing personalized feedback, D. To design a model for peer-to-peer tutoring and collaboration

However, this question does not explicitly mention the analogy of learning math like riding a bike.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] KH Academy is most known for its its collection of videos so before I go any further uh let me show you a little bit of a a montage so the hypotenuse is now going to be five this animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America a nice clean band here and this part of Africa we could integrate over the surface and the notation usually is a capital Sigma National Assembly they create the Committee of Public Safety which sounds like a very nice committee notice this is an alahh and it's an alcohol start differentiating into a fector and memory cells a Galaxy hey there's another galaxy oh look there's another galaxy and for dollars is their 30 million plus the $20 million from the American manufacturer if this does not blow your mind then you have no emotion we now have on the order of of of 2200 videos covering everything from basic arithmetic all the way to to to Vector calculus and some of the stuff that that you saw up there uh we have a million students a month using the site watching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day uh uh but what we're going to talk about in this is is is how we're going to the next level uh but before I I do that I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started and uh some some of y'all might know about five years ago I was an analyst at a hedge fund and I was in Boston and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans remotely and I started putting the First YouTube videos up really just as kind of a nice to have just kind of a supplement for my cousin something that might you know give give or a fresher or something and as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up something interesting happened actually a bunch of interesting things happened the first was the feedback from my cousins they told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person and and and once once you get over the backhanded nature of that there was actually something very profound there they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin at first it's very unintuitive but when you actually think about it from their point of view it makes a ton of sense you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin now they can without feeling like they're wasting my time they could if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago or maybe a couple of years ago uh they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if they're bored they can go ahead they can watch it at their own time at their own pace and probably the the the least appreciated uh I guess aspect of of this is the notion that the very first time the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around A New Concept the very last thing you need is another human being saying do you understand this and that's what was happening with the the interaction with my cousins before and now they could just do it kind of in in kind of in the intimacy of their of their of their own room the other thing that happened is is you know I put them on YouTube just just you know for for the you know I I I saw no reason to make it private so I I let other people watch it and and then people started stumbling on it and and I started getting some comments and some letters and and all sorts of kind of feedback from from random people around the world and you know these are just a few this is actually from one of the original calculus videos and someone wrote just on YouTube it was a YouTube comment first time I smiled doing a derivative and's let's let's pause here this person did a derivative and then they smiled and then in response to that same comment this is on the thread you could go on YouTube and and look at these comments someone else wrote same thing here I actually got a natural high in a good mood for the entire day since I remember seeing all of this Matrix text in class and here I'm all like I know Kung Fu and we got a lot of feedback along those lines you know it's clearly it was helping people but then as as the viewership kept growing and kept growing I I started getting letters from from people and it was it was starting to become clear that it was actually more than just a knife to have uh this is just an except from one of one of those letters uh my 12-year-old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math we have tried everything viewed everything bought everything we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through then we went onto the dreaded fractions again he got it we could not believe it he is so excited and so you can imagine you know here I was a uh an analyst at a hedge fund I it was very strange for me to do something of social value I was I was but uh I I I was excited so I kept going and then a few things other things started to dawn on me that Not only would it help my cousins right now or these people who are sending letters but it could maybe that this content will never go old that it could help their kids or their grandkids if Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus I wouldn't have to ass assum assuming he was good I we don't know uh the other thing that happened you know even at this point you know I said okay maybe it's a good supplement it's good for Motivated students it's good for maybe homeschoolers but I didn't think it would be something that would somehow penetrate the classroom but then I started getting letters from teachers and the teachers would write saying we've used your videos to flip the classroom you've given the lectures so now what we do and this could actually happen in every classroom in America tomorrow what I do is I assign the lectures for homework and what used to be homework I now have the students doing in the classroom and I want to I want to pause here for I I want to pause here for a second because there's a couple of interesting things one when those when those teachers are doing that there's there's the obvious benefit there's the the benefit that now their their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did they can pause repeat at their own pace uh at their own time but the more interesting thing this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom by removing the one- siiz fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home and then when you go to the classroom letting them do work having the Stu the teacher walk around having the peers actually be able to interact with each other these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience a bunch of 30 kids with their fingers on their lips not allowed to interact with each other a teacher no matter how good has to give this kind of one- siiz fists all lecture to 30 students you know blank faces slightly antagonistic and now it's a human experience now they're actually in interacting with each other so once the KH Academy kind of you know I I quit my job and and and we turned into a real organization were not for profit um the question is how do we take this to uh the next level how do we take what those teachers were doing to their natural conclusion and so what I'm showing over here these are actual uh exercises that I started writing for my cousins uh the ones I started were much more primitive this is a kind of a a more competent version of it but the paradigm here is we'll we we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept until you get 10 in a row and the the the Con Academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you don't know how to do it but the Paradigm here it seems like a very simple thing 10 in a row you move on but it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right right now in a in a traditional classroom you have a couple of uh homework homework lecture homework lecture and then you have a snapshot exam and that exam whether you get a 70% an 80% a 90% % or 95% the class moves on to the next topic and even that that that 95% student what was the 5% they didn't know maybe they didn't know what what happens when you raise something to the to the zeroth power and then you go build on that in the next concept that's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle and I give you a bicycle maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time and and I give you that that bicycle for two weeks and then I come back after two weeks and I say well let's see you're having trouble taking left turns you can't quite stop you're you're an 80% bicyclist so I put a big c stamp on your forehead and then I say here's a unicycle but as ridiculous as that sounds that's exactly what's happening in in our in our in our classrooms right now and and and the idea is you know you you fast forward and students start good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing uh calculus all of a sudden despite being smart despite having good teachers and it's usually because they had these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation so our our model is learn math the way you would learn anything like the way you would learn a bicycle stay on that bicycle fall off that bicycle do it as long as necessary until you have Mastery the traditional model it penalizes you for experimentation and failure but it does not expect Mastery we encourage you to experiment we encourage you to failure but we do expect Mastery this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry this is Shifting and reflecting functions and and they all fit together we have we have about 90 of these right now and and you could go to the site right now it's all free not not trying to sell anything but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map that top node right there that's literally singled digigit addition it's like 1+ one is equal to two and the Paradigm is once you get 10 in a row on that then it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules so if you keep so it keep this is go further down the knowledge map we're getting into more advanced arithmetic further down you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra further down you start getting into uh Algebra 1 Algebra 2 a little bit of pre-calculus and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on is from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of okay if you know this and that now you're ready for this next concept now that can work well for an individual learner you know and I one for you to do it with your kids but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it'll it'll change what happens at the dinner table but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about and so what I'm showing you here this is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos School District where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren't using textbooks they're not getting one siiz fits-all lectures they're doing KH Academy they're doing that software for roughly half of their math class and I want to make it clear we don't view this as the complete math education what it does is and this is what's happening in Los Altos it frees up time this is the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to a system of equations and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the Mechanics for the for the robot building for for the estimating how high that Hill is based on its on its shadow and so the Paradigm is the teacher walks in every day every kid works at their own base and a teacher get this is actually a live dashboard from Los Alto school district and they look at this dashboard every row is a student every column is one of those Concepts green means the students already proficient blue means that they're working on it no need to worry red means they're stuck and what the teacher does is literally just says let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their their peer now I kind of come from a very data Centric reality so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions oh what do you not understand or what do you do understand and all of the rest so our Paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible really data that in almost any other field is expected if you're in finance or marketing or manufacturing and so the teachers can actually diagnose what's wrong with the students so that they can make their interaction as productive as possible so now the teachers know exactly what the students been up to how long they've been spending every day what videos have they been watching when did they pause the videos what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they been focused on the Outer Circle shows what the exercises they're focused on the inner circle shows the videos they're focused on and the data gets pretty granular so you can actually see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong red is wrong blue is right the leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted they watched the video right over there and then you could see eventually they were able to get 10 in a row it's almost like you can almost see them learning over those last 10 problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them so you know when you talk about self-paced learning it makes sense for everyone you know in education speak differentiated learning but it's kind of crazy what happens when you actually see it in a classroom because every every time we've done this in every classroom we've done over and over again if you go five days into it there's a group of kids who've raised ahead and there's a group of kids who are a little bit slower and in a traditional model if you did a snapshot assessment you say oh these are the gifted kids these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes but when you let every student work at their own pace and we see it over and over and over again you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago you now would think are gifted and we're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder uh kind of how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from uh really just due to a a coincidence of time now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos um our goal is is to use technology to humanize not just in Los Altos but kind of on a global scale well what's happening in education and actually that that kind of brings an interesting point is you know a lot of the effort in in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our mind the relevant metric is student to valuable human time with the teacher ratio so in a traditional model most of the teacher time is spent doing lectures and Grading tests and and and whatnot maybe 5% of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them now 100% of their time is so once again using technology not just flipping the classroom you're humanizing the classroom I'd argue by by a by a factor of five or 10 and as valuable as it is in Los Altos imagine what that does to the adult learner who's embarrassed to go back and and learn stuff that they should have known before before going back to college imagine imagine what it does to a kid a street kid in Kolkata who has to help his family during the day and that's the reason why he or she can't go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or or or or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or or don't know now imagine what happens where you know we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom but this is all one system there's no reason why you can't have that that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom imagine what happens if that student in Kolkata all of a sudden can tutor your son or your son can tutor that kid in Kolkata and I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of of a global One World classroom and that's that's essentially what we're what we're trying to build thank you I ask question time okay I've I've seen some things you're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback energy points merit badges tell me uh what what you're thinking there oh yeah no we we have an awesome team working on it's not and I have to make it clear it's not just me anymore I'm still doing all the videos we have a kind of a rockstar team doing the software um yeah we've put a bunch of game mechanics in there you get these badges we're going to start having leaderboards by areas and you get point it's actually been pretty interesting just the wording of the badging or or how many points you get for doing something we see on a systemwide basis like tens of thousands of like fifth graders or sixth graders going One Direction or another depending on what you know B badge you give them and the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos how how did that come about yeah no Los Altos been kind of it was kind of crazy they they once again I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms uh someone from from their board came and said oh what would you do if you had cart block launch in a classroom and I said well you know I would just every student work at their own pace on something like this we'd give a dashboard you know and they said oh this is kind of radical we have to think about it and uh me and the rest of the team like oh you know they're never going to want to do this uh uh but literally the next day they're like can you can you start in two weeks and so so it's fifth fifth grade math is where that's going on right now it's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and I think they're doing at the district level I think what they're excited about is they can now follow these kids it's not an only in school thing I mean we've even you know on Christmas we saw some of the kids were doing and we can track everything so they can actually track them as they go through the entire District through the Summers as they go from one teacher to an next you have this continuity of of of data that that even at the district level they can see so some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those those kids so you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they they think they need oh yeah actually most of those were were kind of specs by the teachers we made some of those four students so they could see their data but you know we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves and they're literally saying hey you know this is nice but I like that Focus graph a lot of students say a lot of the teachers said I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus a diagram for them so it's all been teacher-driven it's it's been it's been pretty crazy is this ready for prime time do you think a lot of class classes next school year should try this thing out yeah it's ready it's you know it's uh we got a million people on the side already so we can handle a few more and uh it's uh it's a no no reason why why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow and the the vision of the tutoring thing the idea there is if I'm confused about a topic somehow right in user interface

have learned a couple of weeks ago or maybe a couple of years ago uh they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if they're bored they can go ahead they can watch it at their own time at their own pace and probably the the the least appreciated uh I guess aspect of of this is the notion that the very first time the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around A New Concept the very last thing you need is another human being saying do you understand this and that's what was happening with the the interaction with my cousins before and now they could just do it kind of in in kind of in the intimacy of their of their of their own room the other thing that happened is is you know I put them on YouTube just just you know for for the you know I I I saw no reason to make it private so I I let other people watch it and and then people started stumbling on it and and I started getting some comments and some letters and and all sorts of kind of feedback from from random people around the world and you know these are just a few this is actually from one of the original calculus videos and someone wrote just on YouTube it was a YouTube comment first time I smiled doing a derivative and's let's let's pause here this person did a derivative and then they smiled and then in response to that same comment this is on the thread you could go on YouTube and and look at these comments someone else wrote same thing here I actually got a natural high in a good mood for the entire day since I remember seeing all of this Matrix text in class and here I'm all like I know Kung Fu and we got a lot of feedback along those lines you know it's clearly it was helping people but then as as the viewership kept growing and kept growing I I started getting letters from from people and it was it was starting to become clear that it was actually more than just a knife to have uh this is just an except from one of one of those letters uh my 12-year-old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math we have tried everything viewed everything bought everything we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through then we went onto the dreaded fractions again he got it we could not believe it he is so excited and so you can imagine you know here I was a uh an analyst at a hedge fund I it was very strange for me to do something of social value I was I was but uh I I I was excited so I kept going and then a few things other things started to dawn on me that Not only would it help my cousins right now or these people who are sending letters but it could maybe that this content will never go old that it could help their kids or their grandkids if Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus I wouldn't have to ass assum assuming he was good I we don't know uh the other thing that happened you know even at this point you know I said okay maybe it's a good supplement it's good for Motivated students it's good for maybe homeschoolers but I didn't think it would be something that would somehow penetrate the classroom but then I started getting letters from teachers and the teachers would write saying we've used your videos to flip the classroom you've given the lectures so now what we do and this could actually happen in every classroom in America tomorrow what I do is I assign the lectures for homework and what used to be homework I now have the students doing in the classroom and I want to I want to pause here for I I want to pause here for a second because there's a couple of interesting things one when those when those teachers are doing that there's there's the obvious benefit there's the the benefit that now their their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did they can pause repeat at their own pace uh at their own time but the more interesting thing this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom by removing the one- siiz fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home and then when you go to the classroom letting them do work having the Stu the teacher walk around having the peers actually be able to interact with each other these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience a bunch of 30 kids with their fingers on their lips not allowed to interact with each other a teacher no matter how good has to give this kind of one- siiz fists all lecture to 30 students you know blank faces slightly antagonistic and now it's a human experience now they're actually in interacting with each other so once the KH Academy kind of you know I I quit my job and and and we turned into a real organization were not for profit um the question is how do we take this to uh the next level how do we take what those teachers were doing to their natural conclusion and so what I'm showing over here these are actual uh exercises that I started writing for my cousins uh the ones I started were much more primitive this is a kind of a a more competent version of it but the paradigm here is we'll we we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept until you get 10 in a row and the the the Con Academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you don't know how to do it but the Paradigm here it seems like a very simple thing 10 in a row you move on but it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right right now in a in a traditional classroom you have a couple of uh homework homework lecture homework lecture and then you have a snapshot exam and that exam whether you get a 70% an 80% a 90% % or 95% the class moves on to the next topic and even that that that 95% student what was the 5% they didn't know maybe they didn't know what what happens when you raise something to the to the zeroth power and then you go build on that in the next concept that's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle and I give you a bicycle maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time and and I give you that that bicycle for two weeks and then I come back after two weeks and I say well let's see you're having trouble taking left turns you can't quite stop you're you're an 80% bicyclist so I put a big c stamp on your forehead and then I say here's a unicycle but as ridiculous as that sounds that's exactly what's happening in in our in our in our classrooms right now and and and the idea is you know you you fast forward and students start good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing uh calculus all of a sudden despite being smart despite having good teachers and it's usually because they had these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation so our our model is learn math the way you would learn anything like the way you would learn a bicycle stay on that bicycle fall off that bicycle do it as long as necessary until you have Mastery the traditional model it penalizes you for experimentation and failure but it does not expect Mastery we encourage you to experiment we encourage you to failure but we do expect Mastery this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry this is Shifting and reflecting functions and and they all fit together we have we have about 90 of these right now and and you could go to the site right now it's all free not not trying to sell anything but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map that top node right there that's literally singled digigit addition it's like 1+ one is equal to two and the Paradigm is once you get 10 in a row on that then it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules so if you keep so it keep this is go further down the knowledge map we're getting into more advanced arithmetic further down you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra further down you start getting into uh Algebra 1 Algebra 2 a little bit of pre-calculus and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on is from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of okay if you know this and that now you're ready for this next concept now that can work well for an individual learner you know and I one for you to do it with your kids but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it'll it'll change what happens at the dinner table but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about and so what I'm showing you here this is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos School District where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren't using textbooks they're not getting one siiz fits-all lectures they're doing KH Academy they're doing that software for roughly half of their math class and I want to make it clear we don't view this as the complete math education what it does is and this is what's happening in Los Altos it frees up time this is the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to a system of equations and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the Mechanics for the for the robot building for for the estimating how high that Hill is based on its on its shadow and so the Paradigm is the teacher walks in every day every kid works at their own base and a teacher get this is actually a live dashboard from Los Alto school district and they look at this dashboard every row is a student every column is one of those Concepts green means the students already proficient blue means that they're working on it no need to worry red means they're stuck and what the teacher does is literally just says let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their their peer now I kind of come from a very data Centric reality so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions oh what do you not understand or what do you do understand and all of the rest so our Paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible really data that in almost any other field is expected if you're in finance or marketing or manufacturing and so the teachers can actually diagnose what's wrong with the students so that they can make their interaction as productive as possible so now the teachers know exactly what the students been up to how long they've been spending every day what videos have they been watching when did they pause the videos what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they been focused on the Outer Circle shows what the exercises they're focused on the inner circle shows the videos they're focused on and the data gets pretty granular so you can actually see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong red is wrong blue is right the leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted they watched the video right over there and then you could see eventually they were able to get 10 in a row it's almost like you can almost see them learning over those last 10 problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them so you know when you talk about self-paced learning it makes sense for everyone you know in education speak differentiated learning but it's kind of crazy what happens when you actually see it in a classroom because every every time we've done this in every classroom we've done over and over again if you go five days into it there's a group of kids who've raised ahead and there's a group of kids who are a little bit slower and in a traditional model if you did a snapshot assessment you say oh these are the gifted kids these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes but when you let every student work at their own pace and we see it over and over and over again you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago you now would think are gifted and we're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder uh kind of how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from uh really just due to a a coincidence of time now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos um our goal is is to use technology to humanize not just in Los Altos but kind of on a global scale well what's happening in education and actually that that kind of brings an interesting point is you know a lot of the effort in in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our mind the relevant metric is student to valuable human time with the teacher ratio so in a traditional model most of the teacher time is spent doing lectures and Grading tests and and and whatnot maybe 5% of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them now 100% of their time is so once again using technology not just flipping the classroom you're humanizing the classroom I'd argue by by a by a factor of five or 10 and as valuable as it is in Los Altos imagine what that does to the adult learner who's embarrassed to go back and and learn stuff that they should have known before before going back to college imagine imagine what it does to a kid a street kid in Kolkata who has to help his family during the day and that's the reason why he or she can't go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or or or or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or or don't know now imagine what happens where you know we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom but this is all one system there's no reason why you can't have that that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom imagine what happens if that student in Kolkata all of a sudden can tutor your son or your son can tutor that kid in Kolkata and I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of of a global One World classroom and that's that's essentially what we're what we're trying to build thank you I ask question time okay I've I've seen some things you're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback energy points merit badges tell me uh what what you're thinking there oh yeah no we we have an awesome team working on it's not and I have to make it clear it's not just me anymore I'm still doing all the videos we have a kind of a rockstar team doing the software um yeah we've put a bunch of game mechanics in there you get these badges we're going to start having leaderboards by areas and you get point it's actually been pretty interesting just the wording of the badging or or how many points you get for doing something we see on a systemwide basis like tens of thousands of like fifth graders or sixth graders going One Direction or another depending on what you know B badge you give them and the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos how how did that come about yeah no Los Altos been kind of it was kind of crazy they they once again I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms uh someone from from their board came and said oh what would you do if you had cart block launch in a classroom and I said well you know I would just every student work at their own pace on something like this we'd give a dashboard you know and they said oh this is kind of radical we have to think about it and uh me and the rest of the team like oh you know they're never going to want to do this uh uh but literally the next day they're like can you can you start in two weeks and so so it's fifth fifth grade math is where that's going on right now it's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and I think they're doing at the district level I think what they're excited about is they can now follow these kids it's not an only in school thing I mean we've even you know on Christmas we saw some of the kids were doing and we can track everything so they can actually track them as they go through the entire District through the Summers as they go from one teacher to an next you have this continuity of of of data that that even at the district level they can see so some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those those kids so you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they they think they need oh yeah actually most of those were were kind of specs by the teachers we made some of those four students so they could see their data but you know we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves and they're literally saying hey you know this is nice but I like that Focus graph a lot of students say a lot of the teachers said I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus a diagram for them so it's all been teacher-driven it's it's been it's been pretty crazy is this ready for prime time do you think a lot of class classes next school year should try this thing out yeah it's ready it's you know it's uh we got a million people on the side already so we can handle a few more and uh it's uh it's a no no reason why why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow and the the vision of the tutoring thing the idea there is if I'm confused about a topic somehow right in user interface I'd find people who are volunteering maybe see their reputation and I could schedule and connect up with those people absolutely you know and this is something that I recommend everyone in this audience to do is you can that those dashboards that teachers have you can go log in right now and you could get you can essentially become a coach for your for your your kids your nephews your cousins or or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club um and yeah you you can start becoming a mentor or tutor really really immediately but uh yeah yeah it's all there well it's amazing I I think you just got a glimpse of the future of Education thank you oh thank you [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] there's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs the fact is that we're living longer Medicine has done a much better job making us live longer and the problem is as we age our organs tend to fail more and so currently there not enough organs to go around in fact in the last ten years a number of patients require an organ has doubled well in the same time the actual number of transplants has barely gone up this is now a public health crisis so that's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine it really involves many different areas you can use actually scaffolds biomaterials they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt but specific materials you can actually implanted patients and they will do well and help you regenerate or we can use cells alone either your very own cells or different stem cell populations or we can use both we can use actually biomaterials and the cells together and that's where the field is today but it's actually not a new field interestingly this is a book that was published back in 1938 titled a culture of organs the first author Alexis Carrel and Nobel Prize winner he actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels and some of the blood vessel grafts were used today were actually designed by Alexis but I want you to note his co-author Charles Lindbergh that's the same Charles Lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with Alexis at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the area of the culture of organs so the fields been around for so long why so field clinical advances and that really has to do to many different challenges but if I were to point to three challenges the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time and many advances now we can do that fairly readily the second challenge with cells we could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body over the last 20 years years we've basically tackled that many scientists can now grow many different types of cells plus we have stem cells but even now 2011 there's still certain cells that we just can grow from the patient liver cells nerve cells pancreatic cells still can grow them even today and the third challenge is vascularity the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them so we can actually use biomaterials now this is actually biomaterial we can weave them knit them or we can make them like you see here this is actually like a cotton candy machine you saw this spray going in that was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure this tubular eye structure which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so and that's exactly what we did here because it's actually a patient who presented with a deceased organ and we then created one of these smart biomaterials and we then use that smart bomb material to replace and repair that patients structure what we did was we actually use the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge if you will and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue and you see that patient now six months after with an x-ray showing you the regenerated tissue which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope we can also use cells alone these are actually cells that we obtained these are stem cells that we create from specific sources and these are we can drive them to chem heart cells and they start beating in culture so they know what to do the cells genetically know what to then they start beating together now today many clinical trials using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease so that's actually now in patients or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures we can then use the patient's own cells or some cell population and the biomaterials the scaffolds together so the concept here is if you do have a or injured organ we take a very small piece of that tissue listen half the size of a postage stamp we then tease the cells apart we grow the cells outside the body we then take a scaffold a biomaterial again looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt we then shape that material and we then use those cells to code that material one layer at a time very much like baking a layer cake if you will we then place that in an oven-like device and we're able to create that structure and bring it out this is actually a hard valve that we have engineered and you can see here we have the structure of the heart valve and we've seated that with cells and then we exercise that you so you see the leaflets opening and closing of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to to further studies another technology we have used in patients actually involves bladders we actually take a very small piece of a bladder from the patient less than half the size of a postage stamp we then grow the cells outside the body take the scaffold coat the scaffold with the cells the patient's own cells two different cell types we then put it in this oven like device has the same conditions as a human body 37 degrees centigrade 95% oxygen a few weeks later you have your engineered organ that we're then able to implant back into the patient for these specific patients we actually just suture these materials we use three-dimensional imaging analysis but we actually created these biomaterials by hand but we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells we use now some type of technologies where first solid organs for example like the liver what we do is we take discard livers as you know a lot of organs are actually discarded not used so we can take these liver structures which are not going to be used and we then put them in a washing machine like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away two weeks later you have something that looks like a liver you can hold it like a liver but it has no cells it's just a skeleton of the liver and we then can Reaper fuse the liver with cells preserving the blood vessel tree so we actually profuse first a blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells and we not been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology another technology that we've used is actually that of printing this is actually a desktop inkjet printer but instead of using ink we're using cells and you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure and there's a 3d elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through then finally you're able to get that structure out you can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it and this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implant it as you see here that's all new bone that was implanted using these techniques another more advanced technology we're looking at right now our next generation of technologies are more sophisticated printers this particular printer with worthy signing now is actually 1 we print right on the patient so what you see here is I know it sounds funny but that's the way it works because in reality what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound and you have a scanner basically a cliff like a flatbed scanner that's what you see here on the right side you see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the print hits actually printing the layers that you require on the patient's themselves this is how it actually works here's a scanner going through scanning the wound once it's scanned sends information in layers the correct layers of cells where they need to be and now you're going to see here a demo of is this actually being done in a representative wound and we actually do this with a gel so you can lift the gel material so once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be and this is actually new technology still under development we're also working on more sophisticated printers because in reality our biggest challenge are the solid organs I don't know if you realize this but ninety percent of the patients and the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney patients are dying every day because we don't have enough of those organs to go around so this is more challenging large organ vascular a lot of blood vessels supply a lot of cells present so the strategy here is this is actually a CT scan an x-ray and we go layer by layer using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys we then are able to actually image those do 360-degree rotation to actually analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form so we go layer by layer through the organ analyzing each layer as we go through the organ and we then are able to send that information as you see here through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient this actually shows the actual printer and this actually shows that printing in fact we actually have the printer right here so I'm in while we've been talking today we've actually you can actually see the printer back here in the backstage that's actually the actual printer right now and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here it takes about seven hours to print the kidneys this is about three hours into it now and dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we print a little bit earlier today put a pair of gloves here thank you you're backwards so these clothes are a little bit small on me but here it is you can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today that's a little bit of consistency to it this is dr. Connie who's been working with us in this project and we went a part of our team Thank You dr. Kahn appreciate it so this is actually a new generation this is actually the printer that you see here on stage and this is actually a new technologies we're working on now in reality you know we now have a long history of doing this I'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology that we have had in patients now for a while and this is actually a very brief clip only about 30 seconds of a patient who actually received an organ I was really sick I could barely get out of bed I was missing school it was just pretty much miserable I couldn't you know go out in play you know basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside it was I felt so sick I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like if I was on that so after the surgery life got a lot better for me I was able to do more things I was able to wrestle in high school I became the captain the team and that was great I was able to be you know the normal kid with my friends and because they use my own cells to you know build this bladder it's gonna be with me I got it for life so I'm all set these experiments sometimes work and it's very cool when they do Luke come up please so look before last night when's the last time you saw Tony ten years ago when I had my surgery and it's really great to see him I'm tell us a little about what you're doing well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut I'm a sophomore and studying communications TV and mass media and basically trying to live life like a normal kid which I always wanted growing up but it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working I went through about 16 surgeries and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was ten and this surgery came along and basically made me who I am - and saved my life I'm Tony Dunne hundreds of these what I know from he's he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff I know I was one of first ten people to have this surgery and when I was ten I didn't realize how amazing it was I was a little kid and I was like yet I'll have that I'll have that surgery I all I wanted to do is to get better and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing um when you know you got this call out of the blue I mean Tony's really shy and it took a lot of convincing to get somebody as modest as Tony to allow us to bring Luke so look you go to your communications professors your majoring communications and you ask them for permission to come to Ted which might have a little bit to do with communications and what was their reaction most of my professors were all for it and they said bring pictures and and you know show me the clips online and I'm happy for you there are a couple that were a little stubborn but I had to talk to I pulled him aside well it's an honor of privilege to meet you thank you so much you

**Transcript**:
[Music] there's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs the fact is that we're living longer Medicine has done a much better job making us live longer and the problem is as we age our organs tend to fail more and so currently there not enough organs to go around in fact in the last ten years a number of patients require an organ has doubled well in the same time the actual number of transplants has barely gone up this is now a public health crisis so that's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine it really involves many different areas you can use actually scaffolds biomaterials they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt but specific materials you can actually implanted patients and they will do well and help you regenerate or we can use cells alone either your very own cells or different stem cell populations or we can use both we can use actually biomaterials and the cells together and that's where the field is today but it's actually not a new field interestingly this is a book that was published back in 1938 titled a culture of organs the first author Alexis Carrel and Nobel Prize winner he actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels and some of the blood vessel grafts were used today were actually designed by Alexis but I want you to note his co-author Charles Lindbergh that's the same Charles Lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with Alexis at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the area of the culture of organs so the fields been around for so long why so field clinical advances and that really has to do to many different challenges but if I were to point to three challenges the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time and many advances now we can do that fairly readily the second challenge with cells we could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body over the last 20 years years we've basically tackled that many scientists can now grow many different types of cells plus we have stem cells but even now 2011 there's still certain cells that we just can grow from the patient liver cells nerve cells pancreatic cells still can grow them even today and the third challenge is vascularity the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them so we can actually use biomaterials now this is actually biomaterial we can weave them knit them or we can make them like you see here this is actually like a cotton candy machine you saw this spray going in that was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure this tubular eye structure which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so and that's exactly what we did here because it's actually a patient who presented with a deceased organ and we then created one of these smart biomaterials and we then use that smart bomb material to replace and repair that patients structure what we did was we actually use the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge if you will and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue and you see that patient now six months after with an x-ray showing you the regenerated tissue which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope we can also use cells alone these are actually cells that we obtained these are stem cells that we create from specific sources and these are we can drive them to chem heart cells and they start beating in culture so they know what to do the cells genetically know what to then they start beating together now today many clinical trials using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease so that's actually now in patients or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures we can then use the patient's own cells or some cell population and the biomaterials the scaffolds together so the concept here is if you do have a or injured organ we take a very small piece of that tissue listen half the size of a postage stamp we then tease the cells apart we grow the cells outside the body we then take a scaffold a biomaterial again looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt we then shape that material and we then use those cells to code that material one layer at a time very much like baking a layer cake if you will we then place that in an oven-like device and we're able to create that structure and bring it out this is actually a hard valve that we have engineered and you can see here we have the structure of the heart valve and we've seated that with cells and then we exercise that you so you see the leaflets opening and closing of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to to further studies another technology we have used in patients actually involves bladders we actually take a very small piece of a bladder from the patient less than half the size of a postage stamp we then grow the cells outside the body take the scaffold coat the scaffold with the cells the patient's own cells two different cell types we then put it in this oven like device has the same conditions as a human body 37 degrees centigrade 95% oxygen a few weeks later you have your engineered organ that we're then able to implant back into the patient for these specific patients we actually just suture these materials we use three-dimensional imaging analysis but we actually created these biomaterials by hand but we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells we use now some type of technologies where first solid organs for example like the liver what we do is we take discard livers as you know a lot of organs are actually discarded not used so we can take these liver structures which are not going to be used and we then put them in a washing machine like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away two weeks later you have something that looks like a liver you can hold it like a liver but it has no cells it's just a skeleton of the liver and we then can Reaper fuse the liver with cells preserving the blood vessel tree so we actually profuse first a blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells and we not been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology another technology that we've used is actually that of printing this is actually a desktop inkjet printer but instead of using ink we're using cells and you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure and there's a 3d elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through then finally you're able to get that structure out you can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it and this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implant it as you see here that's all new bone that was implanted using these techniques another more advanced technology we're looking at right now our next generation of technologies are more sophisticated printers this particular printer with worthy signing now is actually 1 we print right on the patient so what you see here is I know it sounds funny but that's the way it works because in reality what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound and you have a scanner basically a cliff like a flatbed scanner that's what you see here on the right side you see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the print hits actually printing the layers that you require on the patient's themselves this is how it actually works here's a scanner going through scanning the wound once it's scanned sends information in layers the correct layers of cells where they need to be and now you're going to see here a demo of is this actually being done in a representative wound and we actually do this with a gel so you can lift the gel material so once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be and this is actually new technology still under development we're also working on more sophisticated printers because in reality our biggest challenge are the solid organs I don't know if you realize this but ninety percent of the patients and the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney patients are dying every day because we don't have enough of those organs to go around so this is more challenging large organ vascular a lot of blood vessels supply a lot of cells present so the strategy here is this is actually a CT scan an x-ray and we go layer by layer using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys we then are able to actually image those do 360-degree rotation to actually analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form so we go layer by layer through the organ analyzing each layer as we go through the organ and we then are able to send that information as you see here through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient this actually shows the actual printer and this actually shows that printing in fact we actually have the printer right here so I'm in while we've been talking today we've actually you can actually see the printer back here in the backstage that's actually the actual printer right now and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here it takes about seven hours to print the kidneys this is about three hours into it now and dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we print a little bit earlier today put a pair of gloves here thank you you're backwards so these clothes are a little bit small on me but here it is you can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today that's a little bit of consistency to it this is dr.

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that mentions the blood supply as a challenge. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 3** is the most similar, although it's not a perfect match. The ground truth MCQ mentions the blood supply as a challenge, while Question 3 mentions designing materials that can go in the body and do well over time, which is related to the challenge of the blood supply.

If I had to provide an index, I would say **3**. However, please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more similar question would be one that mentions the blood supply as a challenge.

Kahn appreciate it so this is actually a new generation this is actually the printer that you see here on stage and this is actually a new technologies we're working on now in reality you know we now have a long history of doing this I'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology that we have had in patients now for a while and this is actually a very brief clip only about 30 seconds of a patient who actually received an organ I was really sick I could barely get out of bed I was missing school it was just pretty much miserable I couldn't you know go out in play you know basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside it was I felt so sick I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like if I was on that so after the surgery life got a lot better for me I was able to do more things I was able to wrestle in high school I became the captain the team and that was great I was able to be you know the normal kid with my friends and because they use my own cells to you know build this bladder it's gonna be with me I got it for life so I'm all set these experiments sometimes work and it's very cool when they do Luke come up please so look before last night when's the last time you saw Tony ten years ago when I had my surgery and it's really great to see him I'm tell us a little about what you're doing well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut I'm a sophomore and studying communications TV and mass media and basically trying to live life like a normal kid which I always wanted growing up but it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working I went through about 16 surgeries and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was ten and this surgery came along and basically made me who I am - and saved my life I'm Tony Dunne hundreds of these what I know from he's he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff I know I was one of first ten people to have this surgery and when I was ten I didn't realize how amazing it was I was a little kid and I was like yet I'll have that I'll have that surgery I all I wanted to do is to get better and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing um when you know you got this call out of the blue I mean Tony's really shy and it took a lot of convincing to get somebody as modest as Tony to allow us to bring Luke so look you go to your communications professors your majoring communications and you ask them for permission to come to Ted which might have a little bit to do with communications and what was their reaction most of my professors were all for it and they said bring pictures and and you know show me the clips online and I'm happy for you there are a couple that were a little stubborn but I had to talk to I pulled him aside well it's an honor of privilege to meet you thank you so much you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6: What is the name of the technology used to print cells and biomaterials? Options: A. Inkjet printing, B. 3D printing, C. Bioprinting, D. Tissue printing**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question is not present in the generated MCQs, but if I had to choose one that closely matches the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, I would say it is:

**Question 7: What is the goal of using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3D reconstruction in regenerative medicine? Options: A. To design biomaterials, B. To create scaffolds, C. To analyze the structure of organs, D. To regenerate tissues**

But this question still does not match the ground truth MCQ. 

If I had to choose a question from the generated MCQs that is similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of the technology being discussed, I would say it is:

**Question 8: What is the name of the printer used to print organs? Options: A. Bioprinter, B. 3D printer, C. Inkjet printer, D. Organ printer**

However, this question is still not a good match.

A good match for the ground truth MCQ would be a question that asks about the steps involved in the working of the advanced technology of a medical printer. Unfortunately, such a question is not present in the generated MCQs.

Therefore, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
[Music] there's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs the fact is that we're living longer Medicine has done a much better job making us live longer and the problem is as we age our organs tend to fail more and so currently there not enough organs to go around in fact in the last ten years a number of patients require an organ has doubled well in the same time the actual number of transplants has barely gone up this is now a public health crisis so that's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine it really involves many different areas you can use actually scaffolds biomaterials they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt but specific materials you can actually implanted patients and they will do well and help you regenerate or we can use cells alone either your very own cells or different stem cell populations or we can use both we can use actually biomaterials and the cells together and that's where the field is today but it's actually not a new field interestingly this is a book that was published back in 1938 titled a culture of organs the first author Alexis Carrel and Nobel Prize winner he actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels and some of the blood vessel grafts were used today were actually designed by Alexis but I want you to note his co-author Charles Lindbergh that's the same Charles Lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with Alexis at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the area of the culture of organs so the fields been around for so long why so field clinical advances and that really has to do to many different challenges but if I were to point to three challenges the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time and many advances now we can do that fairly readily the second challenge with cells we could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body over the last 20 years years we've basically tackled that many scientists can now grow many different types of cells plus we have stem cells but even now 2011 there's still certain cells that we just can grow from the patient liver cells nerve cells pancreatic cells still can grow them even today and the third challenge is vascularity the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them so we can actually use biomaterials now this is actually biomaterial we can weave them knit them or we can make them like you see here this is actually like a cotton candy machine you saw this spray going in that was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure this tubular eye structure which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so and that's exactly what we did here because it's actually a patient who presented with a deceased organ and we then created one of these smart biomaterials and we then use that smart bomb material to replace and repair that patients structure what we did was we actually use the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge if you will and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue and you see that patient now six months after with an x-ray showing you the regenerated tissue which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope we can also use cells alone these are actually cells that we obtained these are stem cells that we create from specific sources and these are we can drive them to chem heart cells and they start beating in culture so they know what to do the cells genetically know what to then they start beating together now today many clinical trials using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease so that's actually now in patients or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures we can then use the patient's own cells or some cell population and the biomaterials the scaffolds together so the concept here is if you do have a or injured organ we take a very small piece of that tissue listen half the size of a postage stamp we then tease the cells apart we grow the cells outside the body we then take a scaffold a biomaterial again looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt we then shape that material and we then use those cells to code that material one layer at a time very much like baking a layer cake if you will we then place that in an oven-like device and we're able to create that structure and bring it out this is actually a hard valve that we have engineered and you can see here we have the structure of the heart valve and we've seated that with cells and then we exercise that you so you see the leaflets opening and closing of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to to further studies another technology we have used in patients actually involves bladders we actually take a very small piece of a bladder from the patient less than half the size of a postage stamp we then grow the cells outside the body take the scaffold coat the scaffold with the cells the patient's own cells two different cell types we then put it in this oven like device has the same conditions as a human body 37 degrees centigrade 95% oxygen a few weeks later you have your engineered organ that we're then able to implant back into the patient for these specific patients we actually just suture these materials we use three-dimensional imaging analysis but we actually created these biomaterials by hand but we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells we use now some type of technologies where first solid organs for example like the liver what we do is we take discard livers as you know a lot of organs are actually discarded not used so we can take these liver structures which are not going to be used and we then put them in a washing machine like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away two weeks later you have something that looks like a liver you can hold it like a liver but it has no cells it's just a skeleton of the liver and we then can Reaper fuse the liver with cells preserving the blood vessel tree so we actually profuse first a blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells and we not been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology another technology that we've used is actually that of printing this is actually a desktop inkjet printer but instead of using ink we're using cells and you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure and there's a 3d elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through then finally you're able to get that structure out you can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it and this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implant it as you see here that's all new bone that was implanted using these techniques another more advanced technology we're looking at right now our next generation of technologies are more sophisticated printers this particular printer with worthy signing now is actually 1 we print right on the patient so what you see here is I know it sounds funny but that's the way it works because in reality what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound and you have a scanner basically a cliff like a flatbed scanner that's what you see here on the right side you see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the print hits actually printing the layers that you require on the patient's themselves this is how it actually works here's a scanner going through scanning the wound once it's scanned sends information in layers the correct layers of cells where they need to be and now you're going to see here a demo of is this actually being done in a representative wound and we actually do this with a gel so you can lift the gel material so once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be and this is actually new technology still under development we're also working on more sophisticated printers because in reality our biggest challenge are the solid organs I don't know if you realize this but ninety percent of the patients and the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney patients are dying every day because we don't have enough of those organs to go around so this is more challenging large organ vascular a lot of blood vessels supply a lot of cells present so the strategy here is this is actually a CT scan an x-ray and we go layer by layer using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys we then are able to actually image those do 360-degree rotation to actually analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form so we go layer by layer through the organ analyzing each layer as we go through the organ and we then are able to send that information as you see here through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient this actually shows the actual printer and this actually shows that printing in fact we actually have the printer right here so I'm in while we've been talking today we've actually you can actually see the printer back here in the backstage that's actually the actual printer right now and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here it takes about seven hours to print the kidneys this is about three hours into it now and dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we print a little bit earlier today put a pair of gloves here thank you you're backwards so these clothes are a little bit small on me but here it is you can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today that's a little bit of consistency to it this is dr.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the generated MCQs, I found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the specific solid organ that 90% of patients on the transplant list are waiting for. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask this specific question.

However, I can suggest that Question 1 is the closest match, as it discusses the organ shortage crisis, which is related to the ground truth MCQ. But it's not a direct match.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if you'd like, I can suggest a new MCQ that is a direct match:

Question: What solid organ are 90% of patients on the transplant list waiting for?
Options: A. Liver, B. Kidney, C. Spleen, D. Heart

This new MCQ is a direct match to the ground truth MCQ.

Index: None (or a new MCQ can be created to match the ground truth MCQ)

Kahn appreciate it so this is actually a new generation this is actually the printer that you see here on stage and this is actually a new technologies we're working on now in reality you know we now have a long history of doing this I'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology that we have had in patients now for a while and this is actually a very brief clip only about 30 seconds of a patient who actually received an organ I was really sick I could barely get out of bed I was missing school it was just pretty much miserable I couldn't you know go out in play you know basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside it was I felt so sick I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like if I was on that so after the surgery life got a lot better for me I was able to do more things I was able to wrestle in high school I became the captain the team and that was great I was able to be you know the normal kid with my friends and because they use my own cells to you know build this bladder it's gonna be with me I got it for life so I'm all set these experiments sometimes work and it's very cool when they do Luke come up please so look before last night when's the last time you saw Tony ten years ago when I had my surgery and it's really great to see him I'm tell us a little about what you're doing well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut I'm a sophomore and studying communications TV and mass media and basically trying to live life like a normal kid which I always wanted growing up but it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working I went through about 16 surgeries and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was ten and this surgery came along and basically made me who I am - and saved my life I'm Tony Dunne hundreds of these what I know from he's he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff I know I was one of first ten people to have this surgery and when I was ten I didn't realize how amazing it was I was a little kid and I was like yet I'll have that I'll have that surgery I all I wanted to do is to get better and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing um when you know you got this call out of the blue I mean Tony's really shy and it took a lot of convincing to get somebody as modest as Tony to allow us to bring Luke so look you go to your communications professors your majoring communications and you ask them for permission to come to Ted which might have a little bit to do with communications and what was their reaction most of my professors were all for it and they said bring pictures and and you know show me the clips online and I'm happy for you there are a couple that were a little stubborn but I had to talk to I pulled him aside well it's an honor of privilege to meet you thank you so much you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the generated MCQs, I found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the time it takes to print a kidney in Atala's medical lab. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 6, which asks about the name of the technology used to print cells and biomaterials. Although it doesn't ask about the time it takes to print a kidney, it is related to the topic of printing organs.

However, I must note that there is no generated MCQ that directly asks about the time it takes to print a kidney. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

If I were to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

Question: How long does it take to print a kidney using the bioprinting technology?
Options: A. Seven years, B. Seven days, C. Seven hours, D. Seven months

This new MCQ directly asks about the time it takes to print a kidney, which matches the ground truth MCQ.

Since there is no good match among the generated MCQs, I will not provide an index. Instead, I suggest creating a new MCQ that directly asks about the time it takes to print a kidney.

[MUSIC PLAYING] My goal is to not actually
do any measurements other than using pie. So the entire thing is
going to pie based. We get the circumference in
the exact number of pies-- give or take-- we get the
diameter in number of pies. Divide one by the other,
we get pi. [MUSIC PLAYING] Pi was historically rarely
calculated this way, because it's notoriously inaccurate
to try and get-- I know, we're idiots-- it's
notoriously inaccurate to try and calculate pi by measuring
a circle. [MUSIC PLAYING] To get any kind of accuracy on
our final answer we have to be as precise as we can be. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is a mild problem, because
I want to go from the very edge of the circle. But as you can see, I've
positioned all the pies exactly on the line as if
they're little mini tangents. So I'm going to have to move
these two out and then I can start doing the diameter exactly
on the circumference there, like that. [MUSIC PLAYING] So that's 84 and 1/3. 264 and 2/3 pies around,
we have the diameter, is 84 and 1/3 pie. To get pi, we just divide the
circumference by the diameter. OK, and if we actually work out
what that is, it equals-- that's pretty good. Pi from pies, we got 3.13834,
which is approximately 3.14. So using pies, we've
got pi to be 3.14. I am a very happy
man right now. With the diameter, and if I know
that ratio, I can just measure the diameter. That's the easy bit
to measure. The center point will
be my pen, and the outside will be the chalk. So the pies, in theory, are
a fairly consistent size. So they're all-- yeah they're about the same. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the result of pi if the circumference and diameter were rounded to the nearest half pie, which is not addressed in any of the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of calculating pi using pies, I would choose Question 6: What is the approximate value of pi calculated using pies? Options: A. 3.0, B. 3.14, C. 3.15, D. 3.16.

This question is related to the topic of calculating pi using pies, but it does not address the specific scenario of rounding the circumference and diameter to the nearest half pie.

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC PLAYING] My goal is to not actually
do any measurements other than using pie. So the entire thing is
going to pie based. We get the circumference in
the exact number of pies-- give or take-- we get the
diameter in number of pies. Divide one by the other,
we get pi. [MUSIC PLAYING] Pi was historically rarely
calculated this way, because it's notoriously inaccurate
to try and get-- I know, we're idiots-- it's
notoriously inaccurate to try and calculate pi by measuring
a circle. [MUSIC PLAYING] To get any kind of accuracy on
our final answer we have to be as precise as we can be. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is a mild problem, because
I want to go from the very edge of the circle. But as you can see, I've
positioned all the pies exactly on the line as if
they're little mini tangents. So I'm going to have to move
these two out and then I can start doing the diameter exactly
on the circumference there, like that. [MUSIC PLAYING] So that's 84 and 1/3. 264 and 2/3 pies around,
we have the diameter, is 84 and 1/3 pie. To get pi, we just divide the
circumference by the diameter. OK, and if we actually work out
what that is, it equals-- that's pretty good. Pi from pies, we got 3.13834,
which is approximately 3.14. So using pies, we've
got pi to be 3.14. I am a very happy
man right now. With the diameter, and if I know
that ratio, I can just measure the diameter. That's the easy bit
to measure. The center point will
be my pen, and the outside will be the chalk. So the pies, in theory, are
a fairly consistent size. So they're all-- yeah they're about the same. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the biggest circle possible that could have its circumference and diameter simultaneously covered with pies, given the size and number of pies. None of the generated MCQs address this specific question.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of circles and pies, I would say that Question 3 or Question 4 are the closest, as they both deal with the circumference and diameter of a circle in terms of pies. But again, they do not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

Therefore, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say Question 3 or Question 4.

Index: 3 or 4 (but not a good match)

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar There's a myth
that grandmasters can see ten, fifteen, twenty moves ahead. And it's a great myth
because I'm a grandmaster and it makes me look
like a super freaking genius. But the truth is, in just the first four moves, there are 318 billion ways you could play. Now, that would be cool
if I could pull that off, but grandmasters just can't,
it's too much. So we use different techniques
to be able to look ahead. And some of these techniques
include chunking, which means taking a group,
a chess position, and seeing what possibilities
can come from just that group; or pattern recognition, which is just going over a lot
of positions that look very similarly and extrapolating truths from that; the stepping-stone method, which is to take a position,
freeze it in your mind, and go from there
to guess the next position. But one of my favorites that I love to solve
these kind of chess puzzles, is called retrograde analysis. And what you do with retrograde analysis is that in order to look ahead,
it pays to look backwards. Now, why is this so useful? Well, in chess,
it's a very complicated case. You got all these chess pieces,
it's 32 pieces, but after five moves, the position
starts to evolve a little bit. And the game starts to go on and you see the chess position
get a little simpler, and a little bit simpler,
and less pieces on the board, until finally -- in this case, a game that I played
in a tournament in Foxwoods, it gets to something like this. When great players play,
it often gets to something like this. You don't see some easy, early checkmate. Grandmasters see through all that stuff. What you see is some end game,
something really, really simple. And we like to study things like this, grandmasters do, so that if we get to them,
we know how to play them cold, but also so that we can steer
the position that's in front of us, the more complex ones you saw earlier, to something this easy, something this simple. So in this way, when you're dead, I already knew like ten moves ago, because I knew where we were going. Now, why is this so effective? Well, it's something about the human mind,
the problem with the human mind. We're very logical creatures. So I want you to play along
with me a few games. Take a look at this sentence. [After reading this sentence, you will realize that the brain
doesn't recognize a second "the."] Now, most of you reading the sentence
the second time around will realize that you missed
the word "the" the first time around. Your mind is very logical,
it proceeds forward, it just ignores anything
that breaks with its logical stream, and so you don't see
the word "the" the first time, the second "the,"
the first time you read it. But if you read this sentence backwards,
you would automatically catch it. You'd go backwards,
and you get to "brain," you get to "the," and then you say, "Whoa,
there are two 'the's' in the sentence." This is a really cool trick
for proofreading papers. You're writing your paper
and there are these silly mistakes. Why are these mistakes in my paper? You read it backwards,
you'll catch all of them. Alright, let's go on to this problem,
an interesting problem. "Bacteria that double every 24 hours fill a lake it has infested
after precisely 60 days. On what day was the lake half-full?" Now, a lot of people see this problem and they'd think, "30, like,
you know, you split it in half." Well, that's not the right answer. And also people might want a calculator. It's too big, it's math, it's boring,
I don't want to do that either. But if you do this problem backwards,
you get the answer right away. What's the answer? 59, obviously. You start at the end, you go backwards, it's like, "Oh yeah,
it's half-full, the answer is 59." Here's another puzzle,
a little bit more complicated. You have six numbers, 1 through 6. The cards are face down. You and I are going to pick a card. You pick a card and you look at it
and it says the number 2. I look at my card,
I think about it for a minute and I say, "I want to trade." The reason I want to trade, we're going to trade to see
who has the highest number at the end. Do you trade with me? Most people say,
"Of course, I got a 2, 2 sucks! There are four numbers higher,
probability says I'm going to do better." Wrong answer,
you're playing a grandmaster. You start from the back
and you work it out. If I had the number 6,
would I offer to trade? Of course not, I'm not dumb. What about the number 5? Probably not either, because you're
not going to say yes if you have a 6. If 5 is not going to trade
and 6 is not going to trade, 4 is going to be like, "I'm not trading either,
because 5's and 6's don't trade." So you see what happens
as we work backwards. 3 is going to realize:
4, 5, and 6 -- they don't trade, so the offer is definitely a 1 and all of you who said yes,
thanks for your money. (Laughter) So, this retrograde analysis
is used in different places. It's used to prove intoxications
hours after an alleged DUI by Pennsylvania police officers, which is kind of cool. Well, it means don't drink and drive. The use of retro-analysis is used in law,
science, medicine, insurance, stock market, politics, career planning. But I find its use
to be in a more interesting place, maybe one of the most
interesting uses is in this movie, which I know a lot of you know, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," where Brad Pitt plays a guy
who's living his life backwards. And what this movie makes me
think of is that great quote, that quote you often hear
from people who are older, that youth is wasted on the young. Well, if you can see the end game, your youth will not be wasted on you. Thank you very much. (Applause)

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the topic of the number of possible ways to continue playing chess after a certain number of moves.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them are similar, but if I had to pick one, I would say Question 3, because it is the only one that deals with numbers and quantities, but it is still very different from the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must emphasize that the generated MCQs do not cover the topic of the ground truth MCQ, and therefore, none of them are a good match.

you know, you split it in half." Well, that's not the right answer. And also people might want a calculator. It's too big, it's math, it's boring,
I don't want to do that either. But if you do this problem backwards,
you get the answer right away. What's the answer? 59, obviously. You start at the end, you go backwards, it's like, "Oh yeah,
it's half-full, the answer is 59." Here's another puzzle,
a little bit more complicated. You have six numbers, 1 through 6. The cards are face down. You and I are going to pick a card. You pick a card and you look at it
and it says the number 2. I look at my card,
I think about it for a minute and I say, "I want to trade." The reason I want to trade, we're going to trade to see
who has the highest number at the end. Do you trade with me? Most people say,
"Of course, I got a 2, 2 sucks! There are four numbers higher,
probability says I'm going to do better." Wrong answer,
you're playing a grandmaster. You start from the back
and you work it out. If I had the number 6,
would I offer to trade? Of course not, I'm not dumb. What about the number 5? Probably not either, because you're
not going to say yes if you have a 6. If 5 is not going to trade
and 6 is not going to trade, 4 is going to be like, "I'm not trading either,
because 5's and 6's don't trade." So you see what happens
as we work backwards. 3 is going to realize:
4, 5, and 6 -- they don't trade, so the offer is definitely a 1 and all of you who said yes,
thanks for your money. (Laughter) So, this retrograde analysis
is used in different places. It's used to prove intoxications
hours after an alleged DUI by Pennsylvania police officers, which is kind of cool. Well, it means don't drink and drive. The use of retro-analysis is used in law,
science, medicine, insurance, stock market, politics, career planning. But I find its use
to be in a more interesting place, maybe one of the most
interesting uses is in this movie, which I know a lot of you know, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," where Brad Pitt plays a guy
who's living his life backwards. And what this movie makes me
think of is that great quote, that quote you often hear
from people who are older, that youth is wasted on the young. Well, if you can see the end game, your youth will not be wasted on you. Thank you very much. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 8 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 8 is not a direct match.

A more suitable match can be found in the options of the other questions. Specifically, Question 2, Option C, mentions "Retrograde analysis" as a technique, and Question 8, Option D, mentions "to work backwards and analyze the situation" which is similar to the concept of retrograde analysis.

However, if I had to choose one of the generated MCQs that best matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 8, as it is the closest match in terms of content and intent.

[Music] well this is about state budgets this is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning but I want to tell you I think it's an important topic that we need to care about state budgets are big big money I'll show you the numbers and they get very little scrutiny the understanding is very low many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are and these budgets are the key for our future they're the key for our kids most education funding whether it's K through 12 or the great universities or community colleges most of money for those things is coming out of these state budgets but we have a problem here's the overall picture US economy it's big fourteen point seven trillion now out of that pie the government spends thirty six percent so this is combining the federal level which is the largest the state level in the local level and it's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what's going on because there's a lot of complex things like Medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries but we're spending 36% well what are we taking in simple business question the answer is 26% now this leaves 10% deficit sort of a mind-blowing number and some of that in fact is due to the fact we've had a economic recession receipts go down some spending programs go up but most of it is not because of that most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends and that creates a huge challenge in fact this is the forecast picture there's various things in here I could say you know we might raise more revenue or medical innovation will make the spending even higher it is a increasingly difficult picture even assuming the economy does quite well probably better than it will do this is is what you see at this overall level now why how did we get here I mean how could you have a problem like this after all there at least on paper there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced only one state says they don't have to balance the budget but what this means actually is that there's a pretense there's no real true balancing going on and in a sense the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don't see things that are actually pretty straightforward challenges when Jerry Brown was elected this was the challenge that was put to him that is through various gimmicks and things a so-called balanced budget had led him to have 25 billion missing out of the 76 billion in proposed spending now he's put together some thoughts about half of that he'll cut another half perhaps in a very complex set of steps taxes will be approved but even so as you go out into those future years various pension costs health costs go up enough and the revenue does not go up enough so you get a big squeeze what were those things that allowed us to hide this well some really nice little tricks and these were somewhat noticed the paper said it's not really balanced it's got holes it perpetuates deficit spending it's riddled with gimmicks and really when you get down to it the guys Enron never would have done this I mean this is so blatant so extreme you know is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do they borrow money they're not supposed to but they figure out a way they make you pay more withholding just helped their cash flow out they sell off the assets they defer the payments they sell off the revenues from tobacco in California is not unique impact there's about five states that are worse the only really four states that don't face this big challenge so it's systemic across the entire country it really comes from the fact that certain long-term obligations healthcare where innovation makes it more expensive early retirement and pension where the age structure gets worse for you and just generosity that these Mis accounting things allowed to develop over time that you've got a problem this is the retiree health care benefits 3 million set aside sixty two billion dollar liability much worse than the car companies and everybody looked at that knew that that was headed towards a huge problem the forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from twenty-six percent of the budget to forty two percent well what's going to give well in order to accommodate that you would have to cut education spending in half it really is this young versus the old to some degree if you don't change that revenue picture if you don't solve what you're doing in health care you're going to be D investing in the young the great University of California University System the great things that have gone on won't happen so far it's meant layoffs increased class sizes within the education community there's this discussion of should it just be the young teachers who get laid off or the less good teachers who get laid off and there's a discussion if you're going to increase class sizes where do you do that how much effect does that have and unfortunately as you get into that people get confused and think well maybe you think that's okay in fact no education spending should not be cut there's ways if it's temporary to minimize the impact but it's a problem it's also really a problem for where we need to go technology has a role to play well we need money to experiment with that to get those those tools in there there's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness measuring them giving them feedback taking videos in the classroom that's something I think is very very important Willie you have allocate dollars for that system and for the that incentive pay in a situation where we have growth you put the new money into this or even if you're flat you might shift money into it but with the type of cuts we're talking about it will be far far harder to get these incentives for excellence order to move over to use technology in the new way so what's going on where where's the brain trust that's in error here well there really is no brain trust it it's sort of the voter's it's sort of us showing up you know just look at this spinning California we'll spend over a hundred billion Microsoft thirty-eight Google about 19 the amount of IQ and good numeric analysis both inside Google and Microsoft and outside with analysts and people that there is opinions should they have spent on that now they wasted their money on this what about this thing it really is quite phenomenal you know everybody has an opinion that there's great great feedback and the numbers are used to make decision if you go over to the education spending the healthcare spending particularly to these long-term trends you don't have that type of involvement on a number that's more important in terms of equity in terms of learning so what do we need to do we need better tools we can get some things out on the internet I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture we need lots more there's a few good books one about school spending and where the money comes from how that's changed over time and the challenge we need better accounting we need to take the fact that the current employees the future liabilities they create that should come out of the current budget we need to understand why they've done the pension accounting the way they have it should be more like private accounting that's the gold standard and finally we need to really reward politicians whenever they say there's these long term problems we can't say oh you're the messenger with bad news we just shot you in fact there are some like these Erskine Bowles Alan Simpson and others who've gone through and given proposal for this overall federal health spending state-level problem but in fact their work sort of pushed off in fact the week afterwards some tax cuts were done that that made the situation even worse than their assumptions so we need these pieces and I think this is a solvable problem you know it's a great country with lots of people but we have to draw those people in because this is about education and just looked at what the tuitions happened with the University of California and project that out for another three four or five years it's unaffordable and that's what that's the kind of thing the investment in the young that makes us great allows us to contribute it allows us to do the art the biotechnology the software and all those those magic things and so the

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content of the transcript, I can infer that the closest match would be a question that relates to the source of education funding.

Since there isn't a direct match, I will choose the question that is closest in terms of content. In this case, it would be Question 4, which talks about the effect of not changing the revenue picture and not solving the healthcare problem on education spending. Although it's not a direct match, it's the closest one in terms of discussing the relationship between state budgets and education funding.

However, if I had to choose an index, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if I really had to choose, I would say Question 4 is the closest, so the index would be 4.

But I must emphasize that the correct answer is not among the generated MCQs. A new question should be generated to match the ground truth MCQ. 

Here is a suggested generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ:
Question: According to the speaker, where does most education funding come from?

[Music] well this is about state budgets this is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning but I want to tell you I think it's an important topic that we need to care about state budgets are big big money I'll show you the numbers and they get very little scrutiny the understanding is very low many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are and these budgets are the key for our future they're the key for our kids most education funding whether it's K through 12 or the great universities or community colleges most of money for those things is coming out of these state budgets but we have a problem here's the overall picture US economy it's big fourteen point seven trillion now out of that pie the government spends thirty six percent so this is combining the federal level which is the largest the state level in the local level and it's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what's going on because there's a lot of complex things like Medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries but we're spending 36% well what are we taking in simple business question the answer is 26% now this leaves 10% deficit sort of a mind-blowing number and some of that in fact is due to the fact we've had a economic recession receipts go down some spending programs go up but most of it is not because of that most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends and that creates a huge challenge in fact this is the forecast picture there's various things in here I could say you know we might raise more revenue or medical innovation will make the spending even higher it is a increasingly difficult picture even assuming the economy does quite well probably better than it will do this is is what you see at this overall level now why how did we get here I mean how could you have a problem like this after all there at least on paper there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced only one state says they don't have to balance the budget but what this means actually is that there's a pretense there's no real true balancing going on and in a sense the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don't see things that are actually pretty straightforward challenges when Jerry Brown was elected this was the challenge that was put to him that is through various gimmicks and things a so-called balanced budget had led him to have 25 billion missing out of the 76 billion in proposed spending now he's put together some thoughts about half of that he'll cut another half perhaps in a very complex set of steps taxes will be approved but even so as you go out into those future years various pension costs health costs go up enough and the revenue does not go up enough so you get a big squeeze what were those things that allowed us to hide this well some really nice little tricks and these were somewhat noticed the paper said it's not really balanced it's got holes it perpetuates deficit spending it's riddled with gimmicks and really when you get down to it the guys Enron never would have done this I mean this is so blatant so extreme you know is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do they borrow money they're not supposed to but they figure out a way they make you pay more withholding just helped their cash flow out they sell off the assets they defer the payments they sell off the revenues from tobacco in California is not unique impact there's about five states that are worse the only really four states that don't face this big challenge so it's systemic across the entire country it really comes from the fact that certain long-term obligations healthcare where innovation makes it more expensive early retirement and pension where the age structure gets worse for you and just generosity that these Mis accounting things allowed to develop over time that you've got a problem this is the retiree health care benefits 3 million set aside sixty two billion dollar liability much worse than the car companies and everybody looked at that knew that that was headed towards a huge problem the forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from twenty-six percent of the budget to forty two percent well what's going to give well in order to accommodate that you would have to cut education spending in half it really is this young versus the old to some degree if you don't change that revenue picture if you don't solve what you're doing in health care you're going to be D investing in the young the great University of California University System the great things that have gone on won't happen so far it's meant layoffs increased class sizes within the education community there's this discussion of should it just be the young teachers who get laid off or the less good teachers who get laid off and there's a discussion if you're going to increase class sizes where do you do that how much effect does that have and unfortunately as you get into that people get confused and think well maybe you think that's okay in fact no education spending should not be cut there's ways if it's temporary to minimize the impact but it's a problem it's also really a problem for where we need to go technology has a role to play well we need money to experiment with that to get those those tools in there there's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness measuring them giving them feedback taking videos in the classroom that's something I think is very very important Willie you have allocate dollars for that system and for the that incentive pay in a situation where we have growth you put the new money into this or even if you're flat you might shift money into it but with the type of cuts we're talking about it will be far far harder to get these incentives for excellence order to move over to use technology in the new way so what's going on where where's the brain trust that's in error here well there really is no brain trust it it's sort of the voter's it's sort of us showing up you know just look at this spinning California we'll spend over a hundred billion Microsoft thirty-eight Google about 19 the amount of IQ and good numeric analysis both inside Google and Microsoft and outside with analysts and people that there is opinions should they have spent on that now they wasted their money on this what about this thing it really is quite phenomenal you know everybody has an opinion that there's great great feedback and the numbers are used to make decision if you go over to the education spending the healthcare spending particularly to these long-term trends you don't have that type of involvement on a number that's more important in terms of equity in terms of learning so what do we need to do we need better tools we can get some things out on the internet I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture we need lots more there's a few good books one about school spending and where the money comes from how that's changed over time and the challenge we need better accounting we need to take the fact that the current employees the future liabilities they create that should come out of the current budget we need to understand why they've done the pension accounting the way they have it should be more like private accounting that's the gold standard and finally we need to really reward politicians whenever they say there's these long term problems we can't say oh you're the messenger with bad news we just shot you in fact there are some like these Erskine Bowles Alan Simpson and others who've gone through and given proposal for this overall federal health spending state-level problem but in fact their work sort of pushed off in fact the week afterwards some tax cuts were done that that made the situation even worse than their assumptions so we need these pieces and I think this is a solvable problem you know it's a great country with lots of people but we have to draw those people in because this is about education and just looked at what the tuitions happened with the University of California and project that out for another three four or five years it's unaffordable and that's what that's the kind of thing the investment in the young that makes us great allows us to contribute it allows us to do the art the biotechnology the software and all those those magic things and so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids in our future thank you [Applause] [Music] when I think about succeeding in business I think there's a couple

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the things that the state of California is doing that leads to a budget deficit. Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is the closest in terms of topic, but it still doesn't match the ground truth MCQ. Question 6 asks about the main problem with the current system of state budgets, which is not directly related to the specific actions of California.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6.

but they figure out a way they make you pay more withholding just helped their cash flow out they sell off the assets they defer the payments they sell off the revenues from tobacco in California is not unique impact there's about five states that are worse the only really four states that don't face this big challenge so it's systemic across the entire country it really comes from the fact that certain long-term obligations healthcare where innovation makes it more expensive early retirement and pension where the age structure gets worse for you and just generosity that these Mis accounting things allowed to develop over time that you've got a problem this is the retiree health care benefits 3 million set aside sixty two billion dollar liability much worse than the car companies and everybody looked at that knew that that was headed towards a huge problem the forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from twenty-six percent of the budget to forty two percent well what's going to give well in order to accommodate that you would have to cut education spending in half it really is this young versus the old to some degree if you don't change that revenue picture if you don't solve what you're doing in health care you're going to be D investing in the young the great University of California University System the great things that have gone on won't happen so far it's meant layoffs increased class sizes within the education community there's this discussion of should it just be the young teachers who get laid off or the less good teachers who get laid off and there's a discussion if you're going to increase class sizes where do you do that how much effect does that have and unfortunately as you get into that people get confused and think well maybe you think that's okay in fact no education spending should not be cut there's ways if it's temporary to minimize the impact but it's a problem it's also really a problem for where we need to go technology has a role to play well we need money to experiment with that to get those those tools in there there's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness measuring them giving them feedback taking videos in the classroom that's something I think is very very important Willie you have allocate dollars for that system and for the that incentive pay in a situation where we have growth you put the new money into this or even if you're flat you might shift money into it but with the type of cuts we're talking about it will be far far harder to get these incentives for excellence order to move over to use technology in the new way so what's going on where where's the brain trust that's in error here well there really is no brain trust it it's sort of the voter's it's sort of us showing up you know just look at this spinning California we'll spend over a hundred billion Microsoft thirty-eight Google about 19 the amount of IQ and good numeric analysis both inside Google and Microsoft and outside with analysts and people that there is opinions should they have spent on that now they wasted their money on this what about this thing it really is quite phenomenal you know everybody has an opinion that there's great great feedback and the numbers are used to make decision if you go over to the education spending the healthcare spending particularly to these long-term trends you don't have that type of involvement on a number that's more important in terms of equity in terms of learning so what do we need to do we need better tools we can get some things out on the internet I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture we need lots more there's a few good books one about school spending and where the money comes from how that's changed over time and the challenge we need better accounting we need to take the fact that the current employees the future liabilities they create that should come out of the current budget we need to understand why they've done the pension accounting the way they have it should be more like private accounting that's the gold standard and finally we need to really reward politicians whenever they say there's these long term problems we can't say oh you're the messenger with bad news we just shot you in fact there are some like these Erskine Bowles Alan Simpson and others who've gone through and given proposal for this overall federal health spending state-level problem but in fact their work sort of pushed off in fact the week afterwards some tax cuts were done that that made the situation even worse than their assumptions so we need these pieces and I think this is a solvable problem you know it's a great country with lots of people but we have to draw those people in because this is about education and just looked at what the tuitions happened with the University of California and project that out for another three four or five years it's unaffordable and that's what that's the kind of thing the investment in the young that makes us great allows us to contribute it allows us to do the art the biotechnology the software and all those those magic things and so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids in our future thank you [Applause] [Music] when I think about succeeding in business I think there's a couple of considerations first and foremost is teamwork today's problems are just too complicated to be solved as an individual and the opportunity to work with others collaboratively where you can build on each other's ideas I think is particularly important I think a second area that's quite important is the understanding of different disciplines it is critical that one be an expert in your major but it is absolutely essential that you have the ability to understand where other disciplines the input from other disciplines and be able to incorporate that to make effective decisions and then last but not least we are in a global business community and so the opportunity to understand cultures different cultures around the world to be able to incorporate some of the learning from those cultures and to incorporate that into your business decisions is essential to success I have three degrees from Cornell so I'd say just about everything that has prepared me came from Cornell and I am indebted to the University for that experience but as I think particularly about my business school career I think the exposure to a variety of disciplines the wealth of resources across the university we're exceptionally helpful

[Music] well this is about state budgets this is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning but I want to tell you I think it's an important topic that we need to care about state budgets are big big money I'll show you the numbers and they get very little scrutiny the understanding is very low many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are and these budgets are the key for our future they're the key for our kids most education funding whether it's K through 12 or the great universities or community colleges most of money for those things is coming out of these state budgets but we have a problem here's the overall picture US economy it's big fourteen point seven trillion now out of that pie the government spends thirty six percent so this is combining the federal level which is the largest the state level in the local level and it's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what's going on because there's a lot of complex things like Medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries but we're spending 36% well what are we taking in simple business question the answer is 26% now this leaves 10% deficit sort of a mind-blowing number and some of that in fact is due to the fact we've had a economic recession receipts go down some spending programs go up but most of it is not because of that most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends and that creates a huge challenge in fact this is the forecast picture there's various things in here I could say you know we might raise more revenue or medical innovation will make the spending even higher it is a increasingly difficult picture even assuming the economy does quite well probably better than it will do this is is what you see at this overall level now why how did we get here I mean how could you have a problem like this after all there at least on paper there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced only one state says they don't have to balance the budget but what this means actually is that there's a pretense there's no real true balancing going on and in a sense the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don't see things that are actually pretty straightforward challenges when Jerry Brown was elected this was the challenge that was put to him that is through various gimmicks and things a so-called balanced budget had led him to have 25 billion missing out of the 76 billion in proposed spending now he's put together some thoughts about half of that he'll cut another half perhaps in a very complex set of steps taxes will be approved but even so as you go out into those future years various pension costs health costs go up enough and the revenue does not go up enough so you get a big squeeze what were those things that allowed us to hide this well some really nice little tricks and these were somewhat noticed the paper said it's not really balanced it's got holes it perpetuates deficit spending it's riddled with gimmicks and really when you get down to it the guys Enron never would have done this I mean this is so blatant so extreme you know is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do they borrow money they're not supposed to

[Music] do you worry about what is going to kill you heart disease cancer a car accident most of us worry about things we can't control like war terrorism the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti but what really threatens humanity a few years ago professor Vaclav SMIL tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history he called these massively fatal discontinuities meaning that they could kill up to a hundred million people in the next 50 years he looked at the odds of another world war of a massive volcanic eruption even if an asteroid hitting the earth but he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to a hundred percent and that is a severe flu pandemic now you might think of flu as just a really bad cold but it can be a death sentence every year 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu in the developing world the data is much sketch here but the death toll is almost certainly higher you know the problem is is that this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic in 1918 a new virus appeared that killed some fifty to a hundred million people it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms are we safer today well we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared but this threat could reappear at any time the good news is that we're at a moment in time when science technology globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth we can do this we're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines and if we get these to more people we can certainly save more lives but with new or better vaccines for malaria TB HIV pneumonia diarrhea flu we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time so I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you but first I have to explain why they're important because vaccines the power of them is really like a whisper when they work they can make history but after a while you can barely hear them now some of us are old enough to have a small circular scar on her arms from an inoculation we received as children but when was the last time you worried about smallpox a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us or polio how many of you remember the iron lung we don't see scenes like this anymore because the vaccines now you know it's interesting because there are 30 odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu why is that well here's the dirty little secret until recently we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked we knew they work through old-fashioned trial and error you took a pathogen you modified it you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened this worked well for most pathogens somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu but not at all for HIV which humans have no natural immunity so let's explore how vaccines work they basically create a catch of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed now when you get a viral infection what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength and that might be too late when you're pre immunized what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes so that's really how vaccines work now let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at Ted for the first time on how an effective HIV vaccine might work a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader after HIV penetrates the body's new coastal barriers it infects immune cells to replicate the invader draws the attention of the immune systems frontline troops dendritic cells or macrophages capture the virus and display pieces of it memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the frontline troops these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed memory b-cells turn into plasma cells which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch on to HIV to prevent it from infecting cells while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected the virus is defeated without a vaccine these responses would have taken more than a week by that time the battle against HIV would already have been lost [Music] really cool video isn't it the antibodies that you just saw in this video in action are the ones that make most vaccines work so the real question that is how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV the principle challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing so let's take a look at the flu virus in this rendering of the flu virus these different color spikes or what it uses to infect you and also what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus when these mutate they change their shape and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore so that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu it's also why in the spring we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall even worse the common most common influenza influenza A also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans and they can recombine in those particular animals in addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza so you've got this situation in 2003 we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated case with an apparent mortality rate of 70% now you know luckily that particular virus although very scary at the time did not transmit from person to person very easily this year's h1n1 threat was actually a human avian swine mixture that arose in Mexico it was easily transmitted but luckily was pretty mild and so in a sense our luck is holding out but you know another wild bird could fly over at any time now let's take a look at HIV as variable as flu is HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibralter the virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogens scientists have ever confronted it mutates furiously it has decoys to evade the immune system it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV a much wilder target in the video a moment ago you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells now realize that in a recently infected person there are millions of these ships each one is just slightly different finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder now in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together these drugs are in cures but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV at least for those who can access them the vaccine effort though is really quite different large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine but today evidence tells us otherwise in September we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand for the first time we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans albeit quite modestly and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago newer concepts in early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models but in the past few months researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of HIV infected individual now what does this mean we saw earlier that HIV is highly variable that a broadly neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of iris if you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models they provide full protection from infection in addition these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab on to and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates it's like as many times as the virus changes its clothes it's still wearing the same socks and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks so what we've got is a situation the tie results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that this strategy working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate has never been done before in vaccine research it's called retro vaccinology and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV so think of it this way we've got these new antibodies we've identified and we know that they latch on to many many variations of the virus we know that they have to latch on to a specific part so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part present that through a vaccine what we hoped is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies and that would create a universal HIV vaccine now it sounds easier it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site and as you can imagine these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this we'd love to hear about it but you know the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases so for instance a biotechnology company has now found royal neutralizing antibodies to influenza as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus they're currently making a cocktail in antibody cocktail that can be used to treat severe overwhelming cases of flu now in the longer term what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine now retro vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design let me give you another example we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus notice these other smaller protuberances these are largely hidden from the immune system now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates if you can these with specific antibodies you could all versions of the flu so far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease although might get a mild case so if this works in humans what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death we really could think of flu then as just a bad cold of course the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it so to do that we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and of course smart delivery methods so I want you to think back a few months ago in June the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years the US government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by October 15 for the flu peak vaccines were promised to developing countries hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing so what happened well we first figured out how to make flu vaccines how to produce them in the early 1940s it was a slow cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs millions of living chicken eggs viruses only grow in living things and so it turned out that for flu chicken eggs worked really well for most strains you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg luckily for us we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances so today we get our flu vaccines from chicken eggs hundreds of millions of chicken eggs you know almost nothing has changed you know the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow this year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production basically point six doses per egg so here's an alarming thought what if that wild bird flies by again you could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines so Dan if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm I know where to get them so right now the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu but this assumes that our factories are humming because in 2004 the US supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant and the process still takes more than half a year so are we better prepared than we were in 1918 well the new technology is emerging now I hope we can say definitively yes imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States with a range of new technologies we could here's an example a company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system if you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium which creates a vigorous immune response they've created a very powerful flu fighter this vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria e.coli now as you know bacteria reproduce quickly it's like making yogurt and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories in a few weeks with no eggs for a fraction of the cost of current methods so here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies and aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings for an example the e.coli method I just talked about look at the time save this would be live saved the developing world mostly left out of the current response sees the potential of these alternate technologies and their leap frogging the West India Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap billions of people can have access to life-saving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them now think of where this leads us new infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years someday perhaps soon we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us will we be quick enough to react before millions die luckily this year's flu was relatively mild I say luckily in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated so if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments we will master these and new tools of X and ology and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives no longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year no longer does aids need to kill 2 million a year no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases or indeed anybody instead of having vacuous meals massively fatal discontinuity of life we can ensure the continuity of life what the world needs now are these new vaccines and we can make it happen thank you very much thank you so thank you so the science is changing in your mind Seth I mean you you must dream about this what is the kind of timescale on let's start with HIV for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable the game change can come in at any time because this is the problem we have now as we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans we just need a better one and with these types of annuals we know humans can make them so if we can figure out how to do that then we have the vaccine and what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're being to crack that problem so the challenge is full speed and your gut do you think it's probably gonna be at least another five years you know that everybody says it's ten years but it's been ten years every ten years so I hate to put I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends and that's the same with universal flu vaccine the same kind of thing I think flu is different I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch of Tigers shown some of there's a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now they look good the problem has been that what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that's what we were comfortable with you also can use adjuvant which are chemicals you mix that's what Europe is doing so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available but going back to what mike respector said you know the anti vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen and malaria is even further behind all no malaria there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in Phase three trials now it probably isn't the perfect vaccine but it's moving along sothe myths let's do work where every month we kind of you know we produce something we get that kind of gratification you've been slaving away at this for more than a decade and I just you know I salute you and your colleagues for what you do the world needs people like you thank you thank you you

**Transcript**:
[Music] do you worry about what is going to kill you heart disease cancer a car accident most of us worry about things we can't control like war terrorism the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti but what really threatens humanity a few years ago professor Vaclav SMIL tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history he called these massively fatal discontinuities meaning that they could kill up to a hundred million people in the next 50 years he looked at the odds of another world war of a massive volcanic eruption even if an asteroid hitting the earth but he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to a hundred percent and that is a severe flu pandemic now you might think of flu as just a really bad cold but it can be a death sentence every year 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu in the developing world the data is much sketch here but the death toll is almost certainly higher you know the problem is is that this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic in 1918 a new virus appeared that killed some fifty to a hundred million people it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms are we safer today well we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared but this threat could reappear at any time the good news is that we're at a moment in time when science technology globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth we can do this we're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines and if we get these to more people we can certainly save more lives but with new or better vaccines for malaria TB HIV pneumonia diarrhea flu we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time so I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you but first I have to explain why they're important because vaccines the power of them is really like a whisper when they work they can make history but after a while you can barely hear them now some of us are old enough to have a small circular scar on her arms from an inoculation we received as children but when was the last time you worried about smallpox a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us or polio how many of you remember the iron lung we don't see scenes like this anymore because the vaccines now you know it's interesting because there are 30 odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu why is that well here's the dirty little secret until recently we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked we knew they work through old-fashioned trial and error you took a pathogen you modified it you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened this worked well for most pathogens somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu but not at all for HIV which humans have no natural immunity so let's explore how vaccines work they basically create a catch of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed now when you get a viral infection what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength and that might be too late when you're pre immunized what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes so that's really how vaccines work now let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at Ted for the first time on how an effective HIV vaccine might work a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader after HIV penetrates the body's new coastal barriers it infects immune cells to replicate the invader draws the attention of the immune systems frontline troops dendritic cells or macrophages capture the virus and display pieces of it memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the frontline troops these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed memory b-cells turn into plasma cells which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch on to HIV to prevent it from infecting cells while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected the virus is defeated without a vaccine these responses would have taken more than a week by that time the battle against HIV would already have been lost [Music] really cool video isn't it the antibodies that you just saw in this video in action are the ones that make most vaccines work so the real question that is how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV the principle challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing so let's take a look at the flu virus in this rendering of the flu virus these different color spikes or what it uses to infect you and also what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus when these mutate they change their shape and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore so that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu it's also why in the spring we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall even worse the common most common influenza influenza A also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans and they can recombine in those particular animals in addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza so you've got this situation in 2003 we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated case with an apparent mortality rate of 70% now you know luckily that particular virus although very scary at the time did not transmit from person to person very easily this year's h1n1 threat was actually a human avian swine mixture that arose in Mexico it was easily transmitted but luckily was pretty mild and so in a sense our luck is holding out but you know another wild bird could fly over at any time now let's take a look at HIV as variable as flu is HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibralter the virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogens scientists have ever confronted it mutates furiously it has decoys to evade the immune system it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV a much wilder target in the video a moment ago you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells now realize that in a recently infected person there are millions of these ships each one is just slightly different finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder now in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together these drugs are in cures but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV at least for those who can access them the vaccine effort though is really quite different large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine but today evidence tells us otherwise in September we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand for the first time we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans albeit quite modestly and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago newer concepts in early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models but in the past few months researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of HIV infected individual now what does this mean we saw earlier that HIV is highly variable that a broadly neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of iris if you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models they provide full protection from infection in addition these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab on to and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates it's like as many times as the virus changes its clothes it's still wearing the same socks and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks so what we've got is a situation the tie results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that this strategy working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate has never been done before in vaccine research it's called retro vaccinology and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV so think of it this way we've got these new antibodies we've identified and we know that they latch on to many many variations of the virus we know that they have to latch on to a specific part so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part present that through a vaccine what we hoped is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies and that would create a universal HIV vaccine now it sounds easier it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site and as you can imagine these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this we'd love to hear about it but you know the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases so for instance a biotechnology company has now found royal neutralizing antibodies to influenza as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus they're currently making a cocktail in antibody cocktail that can be used to treat severe overwhelming cases of flu now in the longer term what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine now retro vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design let me give you another example we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus notice these other smaller protuberances these are largely hidden from the immune system now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates if you can these with specific antibodies you could all versions of the flu so far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease although might get a mild case so if this works in humans what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death we really could think of flu then as just a bad cold of course the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it so to do that we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and of course smart delivery methods so I want you to think back a few months ago in June the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years the US government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by October 15 for the flu peak vaccines were promised to developing countries hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing so what happened well we first figured out how to make flu vaccines how to produce them in the early 1940s it was a slow cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs millions of living chicken eggs viruses only grow in living things and so it turned out that for flu chicken eggs worked really well for most strains you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg luckily for us we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances so today we get our flu vaccines from chicken eggs hundreds of millions of chicken eggs you know almost nothing has changed you know the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow this year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production basically point six doses per egg so here's an alarming thought what if that wild bird flies by again you could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines so Dan if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm I know where to get them so right now the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu but this assumes that our factories are humming because in 2004 the US supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant and the process still takes more than half a year so are we better prepared than we were in 1918 well the new technology is emerging now I hope we can say definitively yes imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States with a range of new technologies we could here's an example a company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system

immune system it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV a much wilder target in the video a moment ago you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells now realize that in a recently infected person there are millions of these ships each one is just slightly different finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder now in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together these drugs are in cures but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV at least for those who can access them the vaccine effort though is really quite different large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine but today evidence tells us otherwise in September we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand for the first time we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans albeit quite modestly and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago newer concepts in early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models but in the past few months researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of HIV infected individual now what does this mean we saw earlier that HIV is highly variable that a broadly neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of iris if you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models they provide full protection from infection in addition these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab on to and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates it's like as many times as the virus changes its clothes it's still wearing the same socks and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks so what we've got is a situation the tie results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that this strategy working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate has never been done before in vaccine research it's called retro vaccinology and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV so think of it this way we've got these new antibodies we've identified and we know that they latch on to many many variations of the virus we know that they have to latch on to a specific part so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part present that through a vaccine what we hoped is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies and that would create a universal HIV vaccine now it sounds easier it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site and as you can imagine these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this we'd love to hear about it but you know the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases so for instance a biotechnology company has now found royal neutralizing antibodies to influenza as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus they're currently making a cocktail in antibody cocktail that can be used to treat severe overwhelming cases of flu now in the longer term what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine now retro vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design let me give you another example we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus notice these other smaller protuberances these are largely hidden from the immune system now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates if you can these with specific antibodies you could all versions of the flu so far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease although might get a mild case so if this works in humans what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death we really could think of flu then as just a bad cold of course the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it so to do that we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and of course smart delivery methods so I want you to think back a few months ago in June the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years the US government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by October 15 for the flu peak vaccines were promised to developing countries hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing so what happened well we first figured out how to make flu vaccines how to produce them in the early 1940s it was a slow cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs millions of living chicken eggs viruses only grow in living things and so it turned out that for flu chicken eggs worked really well for most strains you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg luckily for us we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances so today we get our flu vaccines from chicken eggs hundreds of millions of chicken eggs you know almost nothing has changed you know the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow this year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production basically point six doses per egg so here's an alarming thought what if that wild bird flies by again you could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines so Dan if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm I know where to get them so right now the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu but this assumes that our factories are humming because in 2004 the US supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant and the process still takes more than half a year so are we better prepared than we were in 1918 well the new technology is emerging now I hope we can say definitively yes imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States with a range of new technologies we could here's an example a company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system if you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium which creates a vigorous immune response they've created a very powerful flu fighter this vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria e.coli now as you know bacteria reproduce quickly it's like making yogurt and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories in a few weeks with no eggs for a fraction of the cost of current methods so here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies and aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings for an example the e.coli method I just talked about look at the time save this would be live saved the developing world mostly left out of the current response sees the potential of these alternate technologies and their leap frogging the West India Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap billions of people can have access to life-saving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them now think of where this leads us new infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years someday perhaps soon we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us will we be quick enough to react before millions die luckily this year's flu was relatively mild I say luckily in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated so if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments we will master these and new tools of X and ology and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives no longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year no longer does aids need to kill 2 million a year no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases or indeed anybody instead of having vacuous meals massively fatal discontinuity of life we can ensure the continuity of life what the world needs now are these new vaccines and we can make it happen thank you very much thank you so thank you so the science is changing in your mind Seth I mean you you must dream about this what is the kind of timescale on let's start with HIV for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable the game change can come in at any time because this is the problem we have now as we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans we just need a better one and with these types of annuals we know humans can make them so if we can figure out how to do that then we have the vaccine and what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're being to crack that problem so the challenge is full speed and your gut do you think it's probably gonna be at least another five years you know that everybody says it's ten years but it's been ten years every ten years so I hate to put I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends and that's the same with universal flu vaccine the same kind of thing I think flu is different I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch of Tigers shown some of there's a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now they look good the problem has been that what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that's what we were comfortable with you also can use adjuvant which are chemicals you mix that's what Europe is doing so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available but going back to what mike respector said you know the anti vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen and malaria is even further behind all no malaria there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in Phase three trials now it probably isn't the perfect vaccine but it's moving along sothe myths let's do work where every month we kind of you know we produce something we get that kind of gratification you've been slaving away at this for more than a decade and I just you know I salute you and your colleagues for what you do the world needs people like you thank you thank you you

After analyzing the generated MCQs, I found that Question 3: "What is the main challenge in developing a vaccine for flu?" is not the most similar to the ground truth MCQ, but Question 3's options are not the best match.

However, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest in terms of content, but not in terms of options.

But then I looked at the other questions and I found that Question 2 has an option that says "HIV" which is the virus that causes AIDS, and Question 2 is asking about the name of the virus that causes AIDS, but it's not asking about what is unique about the virus.

So I kept looking and I found that Question 1 is not a good match, but then I saw Question 4 and it's not a good match either.

I kept looking and I found that Question 8 is not a good match, but then I saw Question 9 and it's not a good match either.

I kept looking and I found that Question 10 is not a good match.

But then I looked at the other questions again and I found that Question 5 is not a good match, but then I saw Question 6 and it's not a good match either.

I kept looking and I found that Question 7 is not a good match.

But then I looked at the other questions again and I found that Question 3 is not a good match.

However, I can see that Question 2 has an option that says "HIV" which is the virus that causes AIDS, so I thought maybe I can find a question that is asking something about HIV.

And then I saw that Question 3 is asking about the main challenge in developing a vaccine for flu, but then I saw that the ground truth MCQ is asking about what is unique about the virus that causes AIDS.

So I thought maybe I can find a question that is asking something about what is unique about HIV.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest in terms of content, but not in terms of options.

But since Question 3's options are not the best match, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must provide an answer, so I will choose the index of the generated MCQ that I think is the closest match.

Since I couldn't find a good match, I will choose the index of Question 2, which is the question that is asking about the name of the virus that causes AIDS.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

**Transcript**:
[Music] do you worry about what is going to kill you heart disease cancer a car accident most of us worry about things we can't control like war terrorism the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti but what really threatens humanity a few years ago professor Vaclav SMIL tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history he called these massively fatal discontinuities meaning that they could kill up to a hundred million people in the next 50 years he looked at the odds of another world war of a massive volcanic eruption even if an asteroid hitting the earth but he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to a hundred percent and that is a severe flu pandemic now you might think of flu as just a really bad cold but it can be a death sentence every year 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu in the developing world the data is much sketch here but the death toll is almost certainly higher you know the problem is is that this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic in 1918 a new virus appeared that killed some fifty to a hundred million people it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms are we safer today well we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared but this threat could reappear at any time the good news is that we're at a moment in time when science technology globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth we can do this we're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines and if we get these to more people we can certainly save more lives but with new or better vaccines for malaria TB HIV pneumonia diarrhea flu we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time so I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you but first I have to explain why they're important because vaccines the power of them is really like a whisper when they work they can make history but after a while you can barely hear them now some of us are old enough to have a small circular scar on her arms from an inoculation we received as children but when was the last time you worried about smallpox a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us or polio how many of you remember the iron lung we don't see scenes like this anymore because the vaccines now you know it's interesting because there are 30 odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu why is that well here's the dirty little secret until recently we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked we knew they work through old-fashioned trial and error you took a pathogen you modified it you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened this worked well for most pathogens somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu but not at all for HIV which humans have no natural immunity so let's explore how vaccines work they basically create a catch of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed now when you get a viral infection what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength and that might be too late when you're pre immunized what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes so that's really how vaccines work now let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at Ted for the first time on how an effective HIV vaccine might work a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader after HIV penetrates the body's new coastal barriers it infects immune cells to replicate the invader draws the attention of the immune systems frontline troops dendritic cells or macrophages capture the virus and display pieces of it memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the frontline troops these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed memory b-cells turn into plasma cells which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch on to HIV to prevent it from infecting cells while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected the virus is defeated without a vaccine these responses would have taken more than a week by that time the battle against HIV would already have been lost [Music] really cool video isn't it the antibodies that you just saw in this video in action are the ones that make most vaccines work so the real question that is how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV the principle challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing so let's take a look at the flu virus in this rendering of the flu virus these different color spikes or what it uses to infect you and also what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus when these mutate they change their shape and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore so that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu it's also why in the spring we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall even worse the common most common influenza influenza A also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans and they can recombine in those particular animals in addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza so you've got this situation in 2003 we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated case with an apparent mortality rate of 70% now you know luckily that particular virus although very scary at the time did not transmit from person to person very easily this year's h1n1 threat was actually a human avian swine mixture that arose in Mexico it was easily transmitted but luckily was pretty mild and so in a sense our luck is holding out but you know another wild bird could fly over at any time now let's take a look at HIV as variable as flu is HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibralter the virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogens scientists have ever confronted it mutates furiously it has decoys to evade the immune system it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV a much

think back a few months ago in June the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years the US government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by October 15 for the flu

The ground truth MCQ asks about the location where research found that an AIDS vaccine worked in humans for the first time. The most similar generated MCQ is not present, but Question 2 mentions AIDS, and Question 4 discusses a technique related to vaccine development.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would select Question 2, but it's not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ. Here's an example of a new generated MCQ:

Question: Where was the first successful AIDS vaccine trial in humans conducted?
Options: A. Thailand, B. Mexico, C. Vietnam, D. South Africa

This new generated MCQ is a better match for the ground truth MCQ.

Since the original generated MCQs do not have a good match, I will not provide an index. Instead, I suggest generating new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
[Music] do you worry about what is going to kill you heart disease cancer a car accident most of us worry about things we can't control like war terrorism the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti but what really threatens humanity a few years ago professor Vaclav SMIL tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history he called these massively fatal discontinuities meaning that they could kill up to a hundred million people in the next 50 years he looked at the odds of another world war of a massive volcanic eruption even if an asteroid hitting the earth but he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to a hundred percent and that is a severe flu pandemic now you might think of flu as just a really bad cold but it can be a death sentence every year 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu in the developing world the data is much sketch here but the death toll is almost certainly higher you know the problem is is that this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic in 1918 a new virus appeared that killed some fifty to a hundred million people it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms are we safer today well we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared but this threat could reappear at any time the good news is that we're at a moment in time when science technology globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth we can do this we're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines and if we get these to more people we can certainly save more lives but with new or better vaccines for malaria TB HIV pneumonia diarrhea flu we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time so I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you but first I have to explain why they're important because vaccines the power of them is really like a whisper when they work they can make history but after a while you can barely hear them now some of us are old enough to have a small circular scar on her arms from an inoculation we received as children but when was the last time you worried about smallpox a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us or polio how many of you remember the iron lung we don't see scenes like this anymore because the vaccines now you know it's interesting because there are 30 odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu why is that well here's the dirty little secret until recently we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked we knew they work through old-fashioned trial and error you took a pathogen you modified it you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened this worked well for most pathogens somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu but not at all for HIV which humans have no natural immunity so let's explore how vaccines work they basically create a catch of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed now when you get a viral infection what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength and that might be too late when you're pre immunized what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes so that's really how vaccines work now let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at Ted for the first time on how an effective HIV vaccine might work a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader after HIV penetrates the body's new coastal barriers it infects immune cells to replicate the invader draws the attention of the immune systems frontline troops dendritic cells or macrophages capture the virus and display pieces of it memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the frontline troops these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed memory b-cells turn into plasma cells which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch on to HIV to prevent it from infecting cells while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected the virus is defeated without a vaccine these responses would have taken more than a week by that time the battle against HIV would already have been lost [Music] really cool video isn't it the antibodies that you just saw in this video in action are the ones that make most vaccines work so the real question that is how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV the principle challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing so let's take a look at the flu virus in this rendering of the flu virus these different color spikes or what it uses to infect you and also what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus when these mutate they change their shape and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore so that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu it's also why in the spring we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall even worse the common most common influenza influenza A also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans and they can recombine in those particular animals in addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza so you've got this situation in 2003 we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated case with an apparent mortality rate of 70% now you know luckily that particular virus although very scary at the time did not transmit from person to person very easily this year's h1n1 threat was actually a human avian swine mixture that arose in Mexico it was easily transmitted but luckily was pretty mild and so in a sense our luck is holding out but you know another wild bird could fly over at any time now let's take a look at HIV as variable as flu is HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibralter the virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogens scientists have ever confronted it mutates furiously it has decoys to evade the immune system it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV a much wilder target in the video a moment ago you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells now realize that in a recently infected person there are millions of these ships each one is just slightly different finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder now in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together these drugs are in cures but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV at least for those who can access them the vaccine effort though is really quite different large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine but today evidence tells us otherwise in September we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand for the first time we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans albeit quite modestly and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago newer concepts in early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models but in the past few months researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of HIV infected individual now what does this mean we saw earlier that HIV is highly variable that a broadly neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of iris if you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models they provide full protection from infection in addition these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab on to and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates it's like as many times as the virus changes its clothes it's still wearing the same socks and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks so what we've got is a situation the tie results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that this strategy working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate has never been done before in vaccine research it's called retro vaccinology and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV so think of it this way we've got these new antibodies we've identified and we know that they latch on to many many variations of the virus we know that they have to latch on to a specific part so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part present that through a vaccine what we hoped is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies and that would create a universal HIV vaccine now it sounds easier it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site and as you can imagine these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this we'd love to hear about it but you know the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases so for instance a biotechnology company has now found royal neutralizing antibodies to influenza as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus they're currently making a cocktail in antibody cocktail that can be used to treat severe overwhelming cases of flu now in the longer term what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine now retro vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design let me give you another example we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus notice these other smaller protuberances these are largely hidden from the immune system now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates if you can these with specific antibodies you could all versions of the flu so far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease although might get a mild case so if this works in humans what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death we really could think of flu then as just a bad cold of course the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it so to do that we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and of course smart delivery methods so I want you to think back a few months ago in June the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years the US government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by October 15 for the flu peak vaccines were promised to developing countries hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing so what happened well we first figured out how to make flu vaccines how to produce them in the early 1940s it was a slow cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs millions of living chicken eggs viruses only grow in living things and so it turned out that for flu chicken eggs worked really well for most strains you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg luckily for us we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances so today we get our flu vaccines from chicken eggs hundreds of millions of chicken eggs you know almost nothing has changed you know the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow this year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production basically point six doses per egg so here's an alarming thought what if that wild bird flies by again you could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines so Dan if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm I know where to get them so right now the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu but this assumes that our factories are humming because in 2004 the US supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant and the process still takes more than half a year so are we better prepared than we were in 1918 well the new technology is emerging now I hope we can say definitively yes imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States with a range of new technologies we could here's an example a company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system if you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium which creates a vigorous immune response they've created a very powerful flu fighter this vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria e.coli now as you know bacteria reproduce quickly it's like making yogurt and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories in a few weeks with no eggs for a fraction of the cost of current methods so here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies and aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings for an example the e.coli method I just talked about look at the time save this would be live saved the developing world mostly left out of the current response sees the potential of these alternate technologies and their leap frogging the West India Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap billions of people can have access to life-saving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them now think of where this leads us new infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years someday perhaps soon we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us will we be quick enough to react before millions die luckily this year's flu was relatively mild I say luckily in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated so if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments we will master these and new tools of X and ology and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives no longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year no longer does aids need to kill 2 million a year no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases or indeed anybody instead of having vacuous meals massively fatal discontinuity of life we can ensure the continuity of life what the world needs now are these new vaccines and we can make it happen thank you very much thank you so thank you so the science is changing in your mind Seth I mean you you must dream about this what is the kind of timescale on let's start with HIV for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable the game change can come in at any time because this is the problem we have now as we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans we just need a better one and with these types of annuals we know humans can make them so if we can figure out how to do that then we have the vaccine and what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're being to crack that problem so the challenge is full speed and your gut do you think it's probably gonna be at least another five years you know that everybody says it's ten years but it's been ten years every ten years so I hate to put I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends and that's the same with universal flu vaccine the same kind of thing I think flu is different I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch of Tigers shown some of there's a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now they look good the problem has been that what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that's what we were comfortable with you also can use adjuvant which are chemicals you mix that's what Europe is doing so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available but going back to what mike respector said you know the anti vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen and malaria is even further behind all no malaria there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in Phase three trials now it probably isn't the perfect vaccine but it's moving along sothe myths let's do work where every month we kind of you know we produce something we get that kind of gratification you've been slaving away at this for more than a decade and I just you know I salute you and your colleagues for what you do the world needs people like you thank you thank you you

Matching Response:
After analyzing the generated MCQs, I found that Question 5 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ. 

Question 5: What is the estimated number of doses of flu vaccine that can be produced per year using traditional methods? Options: A. 350 million, B. 1.2 billion, C. 2.5 billion, D. 5 billion 

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it mentions the production of flu vaccines, which is related to the ground truth MCQ that asks where we get our flu vaccines. Although the questions are not identical, they both deal with the topic of flu vaccine production.

However, upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I realized that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the source of flu vaccines, whereas the generated MCQs do not.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of flu vaccines, I would choose Question 5. Nevertheless, I must emphasize that the generated MCQs do not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

[Music] eight to be great the eight traits successful people have in common number three focus when I asked James Cameron how he managed to produce the two highest grossing films of all time Titanic and Avatar he said Focus had a lot to do with it he said you've got to be super focused like a laser to get anything worthwhile done he said when I did Avatar I was focused for four years now I'm not saying you never think wide at the beginning of anything whether it's your career or a problem you're trying to solve you got to think wide you got to take lots of stuff in and I say when you're young don't Focus too soon just know in the back of your mind that success requires a single-minded focus as Larry p co-founder Google said to me you should focus on one important goal and you need to be pretty single-minded about it it was a single-minded focus that enabled astrophysicists to build a space telescope the size of a of a suitcase that only cost 10 million bucks compared to the two billion it cost to build the Hubble and when I asked Mission scientist Jamie Matthews about it he said focus is the key word for our success we pulled this off on a tight budget and short timeline because we just did one thing thing exceptionally well we didn't try and make the Swiss army knife of telescopes that did a lot of things successful companies focus when Tom Monahan the founder of Domino's Pizza was asked the The Secret of his success he set a fanatical focus on doing one thing well Bill Gates would agree he says if you want to be a great software company you have to be only a software company you can't dabble in other things but many companies and people do dabble and I was one of them after 10 years in the workforce I was dabbling in many different areas and on the personal front I was all over the map so I was okay at a lot of things but I wasn't great at any one thing and when I looked at successful people it was just the opposite they're not great at everything they're only great at one thing Quincy Jones told me he can't even drive a car because he's focused his whole life on making great music and that's what made him great so I figured I had to focus and become an expert at something so I cut out all the dabbling of focused only on photography I became a successful advertising photographer and I even won Top Awards in both photography and video so I discovered Focus really does pay off in addition to long-term Focus there's also short-term concentration just being able to put our heads down and get something done right now Jennifer Mather a famous animal behavior says I have a ferocious ability to concentrate I can say I'm going to do this and close the rest of the world off concentration helped yon Kim succeed he was working at minimum wage in a 7-Eleven store then he developed Yuri systems sold it to Lucent personally made 500 million cash and became president of Lucen Technologies and he said concentration had a lot to do with it he said I can work day and night and maintain the concentration without getting burned out so concentration is a valuable skill to develop and it's not easy to develop when there's so many distractions out there and scientists are developing new ones all the time although it's not easy cuz they keep getting distracted now with emails mobile phones and all the stuff on the web it's a wonder we can we can concentrate for 5 seconds before something warbles beeps vibrates or plays somebody's favorite tune but the trick is to eliminate the distractions when we need to concentrate best-selling author Stephen King says if you want to be a writer there should be no phone in your writing room no TV no video games draw the curtains eliminate every possible distraction and by doing that he became one of the world's most popular writers and remember Warren Buffett became one of the world's richest men by living in a constant state of no distractions it's called Nebraska he says when I worked back in New York there were more stimuli hitting me all the time it's much easier to think here and I wonder if that isn't one of the big reasons why so many successful people I interview actually grew up in small towns not big cities fewer dist ractions more ability to focus and concentrate but now all that's going to change cuz with the internet we can be in the middle of nowhere and still be distracted and concentration doesn't always mean being in a quiet room or alone many people actually use noise to eliminate distractions Stephen King does remember he's the guy who said eliminate every possible distraction but he also says I work to loud music for me the music is just another way of shutting the door John silly Brown also uses noise to eliminate distractions he's Chief scientist at Xerox and he said to me I did my doctoral thesis in a bar because I love the noise I could concentrate even with the noise All Around Me geez I thought all those people in bars were partying now it turns out they could be phds and learning how to concentrate is all about practice practice practice Lindsey Sharp heads up four museums in London and he said to me it's very hard to concentrate so you have to practice a lot he said I learned how to study in the middle of an airport so now if I'm concentrating and there's a siren outside I don't even hear it the bottom line Focus helps us succeed whether it's long-term Focus or shortterm [Applause] concentration

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: What is the main idea that successful people have in common, according to the speaker? Options: A. Being great at many things, B. Being focused on one thing, C. Having a lot of money, D. Being in a big city**

Although the question is not an exact match, the intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about Tom Monaghan's secret to success, which is "a fanatical focus on doing one thing well." Question 2 asks about the main idea that successful people have in common, which is also related to focus.

However, a closer match is:

**Question 4: What is the benefit of focusing on one thing, according to the speaker? Options: A. You become great at many things, B. You become a famous musician, C. You become an expert at something, D. You have more time to relax**

This question is more similar in intent and content to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the benefit of focusing on one thing, which is related to Tom Monaghan's secret to success.

But the closest match is:

None of the above questions, but if I had to choose it would be **Question 3: Who said, "If you want to be a great software company, you have to be only a software company"? Options: A. Bill Gates, B. Tom Monahan, C. Larry Page, D. Steve Jobs** 

It is not the correct match because the question is asking about a quote from Bill Gates and not about Tom Monaghan's secret to success.

However, I noticed that there is a part of the transcript that is similar to the ground truth MCQ:

"...Tom Monahan the founder of Domino's Pizza was asked the The Secret of his success he set a fanatical focus on doing one thing well..."

And I also noticed that there is a generated MCQ that is similar to this part of the transcript:

Unfortunately, it is not among the options.

If I had to choose from the given options, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3**

However, I must emphasize that this is not a perfect match, and a more accurate match would be a question that asks about Tom Monaghan's secret to success, with options that include "a fanatical focus on doing one thing well."

If I really had to choose I would say that the best match is **Question 3**, however I am not confident in the match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: Who said, "If you want to be a great software company, you have to be only a software company"?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. Both questions mention a quote from a successful person (Larry Page in the ground truth MCQ and Bill Gates in the generated MCQ) emphasizing the importance of focus.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. To create a more similar MCQ, I would suggest rephrasing Question 3 to:

**Question: Who said, "You should focus on one important goal and you need to be pretty single-minded about it"?**

This revised question would more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

Since I have to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I will select the index of the most similar generated MCQ:

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: What is the value of concentration, according to Jennifer Mather?**

Although the question is not an exact match, the content and intent are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the need for SHORT-TERM concentration in addition to LONG-TERM FOCUS, while Question 5 asks about the value of concentration according to Jennifer Mather. The correct option for Question 5 is not explicitly stated, but based on the transcript, Jennifer Mather mentions that she has a "ferocious ability to concentrate," implying that concentration is a valuable skill.

However, a closer match is not found among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but I would like to note that the generated MCQs do not closely match the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 7 is the closest. It talks about concentration and eliminating distractions, which is related to Lindsay Sharp's ability to concentrate in a distracting environment, such as an airport.

But since Question 7 does not specifically mention Lindsay Sharp or an airport, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say -1 or None, indicating that no generated MCQ matches the ground truth MCQ.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I'm going to take you on a journey into some hidden worlds inside your own body using the scanning electron microscope. These microscopes use a beam of electrons to illuminate things that are too small to be seen by the photons of visible light. And to put this in context, if you mentally divide one tiny millimeter into a thousand parts, each one of those parts is a micrometer, or micron for short. If you then divide one micron into another thousand parts, each one of those is a nanometer. And it's nanometers and microns that are the domain of the scanning electron microscope. So, let's start with something on the body that we can measure at about 100 microns wide, and that would be a human hair, which now you can see is covered with scales, just like all of our hairs, and in fact, just like all mammal hairs. We're going to plunge into the body now, and we've landed in the thyroid gland. Here we're looking at proteins that are being secreted into a storage chamber where they are going to develop into the mature thyroid hormones before being released into the body. And at this point you might be wondering if these colors are real. The answer is no. Electron images only happen in black and white. I often colorize my images for various reasons, but I don't change the structures, so the strucutres that you're seeing are all exactly as they were when I photographed them in the microscope. We're going to take a detour and zoom in on the heart muscle now. And the heart muscle has this curious structure that's kind of like corrugated cardboard. That's what allows the heart to expand and contract as it's beating. Let's go look at a lung with pneumonia. Here we've got a white blood cell poking around in an air sac, looking for something to clean out like a little vacuum cleaner. This is your immune systems at work. So what are the kinds of things that we don't want to be breathing, besides bacteria and viruses? Well, we all know to stay away from asbestos and now we can see why. This is a close-up view of the mineral that asbestos is made from, and now you can see that it's composed of many tiny, fine little needles. Each one of those needles is a single crystal. And in this picture, they're begininng to pry apart and tangle up into a spiky mess, not for breathing. What else might we want to avoid breathing? Well, how about diesel fuel? We're looking here at the particles of diesel soot, and these are extraordinarily tiny. In fact, each one of these little particles is only about 50 nanometers wide. We'll go and look at some blood now. We've got a collection of nice, fat, happy, healthy red blood cells, but they're all tangled up in a network of fibers. This is how the body makes a blood clot. And so, it surrounds a group of red blood cells and other cells, and traps them so the blood can't flow. We've got two more blood cells here, but they're not normal like the ones in the blood clot image. These are distorted. You can see that they're curling up and beginning to grow what's going to become spikes. These are sickle cells and these are what cause the condition of sickle cell amenia. We've gone into the mouth now and we've landed on dental plague, which you can see is covered with bacteria, and in fact dental plague is host to about 1,000 different species of bacteria. Lovely to think about. And now we are on to other teeth. We're on the surfaces of the, or the internal surfaces of the teeth themselves. The smaller one is a baby tooth that had just fallen out of the mouth of a young friend of mine, and I want to call your attention to the little holes. Those little holes are the tops of a whole network of tiny little tubes that circulate nourishing fluids inside your teeth. And we can see those tubes a little better in the larger picture because some of them are in cross-section. But in fact, this larger picture is showing you a portion of a tusk, which you may know is simply a great big, elongated tooth, so you would expect to see the same features between your teeth and a tusk. But that larger tusk picture is also rough by comparison to the young baby tooth. That's because it's many, many thousands of years old. It's also partly fossilized. And, between these two pictures, now you can see how your teeth relate to the tusk of an Ice Age mammoth. We're shooting up north now into the brain, and we can see these pink cells down at the bottom. Those are the neurons of memory. And I'm going to leave you with this picture because I know you're going to take a lot of happy memories away from your exciting day at TED and now you can visualize where those memories are being stored in your own brain.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I'm going to take you on a journey into some hidden worlds inside your own body using the scanning electron microscope. These microscopes use a beam of electrons to illuminate things that are too small to be seen by the photons of visible light. And to put this in context, if you mentally divide one tiny millimeter into a thousand parts, each one of those parts is a micrometer, or micron for short. If you then divide one micron into another thousand parts, each one of those is a nanometer. And it's nanometers and microns that are the domain of the scanning electron microscope. So, let's start with something on the body that we can measure at about 100 microns wide, and that would be a human hair, which now you can see is covered with scales, just like all of our hairs, and in fact, just like all mammal hairs.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content of the transcript, I can identify a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the part of the body that is about 100 microns wide, and the correct answer is "Hair". 

Among the generated MCQs, none directly ask about the width of a body part in microns. However, Question 1 mentions the scanning electron microscope, which is used to measure objects in microns and nanometers. But it does not ask about a specific body part.

Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of measurement in microns, I would suggest Question 1, but with the caveat that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If you would like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

And to put this in context, if you mentally divide one tiny millimeter into a thousand parts, each one of those parts is a micrometer, or micron for short. If you then divide one micron into another thousand parts, each one of those is a nanometer. And it's nanometers and microns that are the domain of the scanning electron microscope. So, let's start with something on the body that we can measure at about 100 microns wide, and that would be a human hair, which now you can see is covered with scales, just like all of our hairs, and in fact, just like all mammal hairs. We're going to plunge into the body now, and we've landed in the thyroid gland. Here we're looking at proteins that are being secreted into a storage chamber where they are going to develop into the mature thyroid hormones before being released into the body. And at this point you might be wondering if these colors are real. The answer is no. Electron images only happen in black and white. I often colorize my images for various reasons, but I don't change the structures, so the strucutres that you're seeing are all exactly as they were when I photographed them in the microscope. We're going to take a detour and zoom in on the heart muscle now. And the heart muscle has this curious structure that's kind of like corrugated cardboard. That's what allows the heart to expand and contract as it's beating. Let's go look at a lung with pneumonia. Here we've got a white blood cell poking around in an air sac, looking for something to clean out like a little vacuum cleaner. This is your immune systems at work. So what are the kinds of things that we don't want to be breathing, besides bacteria and viruses? Well, we all know to stay away from asbestos and now we can see why. This is a close-up view of the mineral that asbestos is made from, and now you can see that it's composed of many tiny, fine little needles. Each one of those needles is a single crystal. And in this picture, they're begininng to pry apart and tangle up into a spiky mess, not for breathing. What else might we want to avoid breathing? Well, how about diesel fuel? We're looking here at the particles of diesel soot, and these are extraordinarily tiny. In fact, each one of these little particles is only about 50 nanometers wide. We'll go and look at some blood now. We've got a collection of nice, fat, happy, healthy red blood cells, but they're all tangled up in a network of fibers. This is how the body makes a blood clot. And so, it surrounds a group of red blood cells and other cells, and traps them so the blood can't flow. We've got two more blood cells here, but they're not normal like the ones in the blood clot image. These are distorted. You can see that they're curling up and beginning to grow what's going to become spikes. These are sickle cells and these are what cause the condition of sickle cell amenia. We've gone into the mouth now and we've landed on dental plague, which you can see is covered with bacteria, and in fact dental plague is host to about 1,000 different species of bacteria. Lovely to think about. And now we are on to other teeth. We're on the surfaces of the, or the internal surfaces of the teeth themselves. The smaller one is a baby tooth that had just fallen out of the mouth of a young friend of mine, and I want to call your attention to the little holes. Those little holes are the tops of a whole network of tiny little tubes that circulate nourishing fluids inside your teeth. And we can see those tubes a little better in the larger picture because some of them are in cross-section. But in fact, this larger picture is showing you a portion of a tusk, which you may know is simply a great big, elongated tooth, so you would expect to see the same features between your teeth and a tusk. But that larger tusk picture is also rough by comparison to the young baby tooth. That's because it's many, many thousands of years old. It's also partly fossilized. And, between these two pictures, now you can see how your teeth relate to the tusk of an Ice Age mammoth. We're shooting up north now into the brain, and we can see these pink cells down at the bottom. Those are the neurons of memory. And I'm going to leave you with this picture because I know you're going to take a lot of happy memories away from your exciting day at TED and now you can visualize where those memories are being stored in your own brain. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so sometimes I get invited to give weird talks uh I got invited to speak to the people who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes to perform at sporting events unfortunately I I couldn't go but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys at least most of them know what it is that they do for a living what they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events shortly after that I got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals and again I couldn't go but it's a fascinating group they make balloon animals there's a big Schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals but they do a lot of really cool stuff with sometimes they get in trouble but not often and the other thing about these guys is they also know what they do for a living they make balloon animals but what do we do for a living what exactly do the people watching this do every day and I want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything that we try to find a piece of the status quo something that bothers us something that needs to be improved something that's itching to be changed and we change it and we try to make big permanent important change but we don't think about it that way and we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like and I've been studying it for a couple years and I want to share a couple stories with you today first about a guy named Nathan winegrad Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA and what you may not know about the history of the sbca is it was founded to kill dogs and cats cities gave them a charter to get rid of the Stray animals on the street and Destroy them and in a typical year 4 million dogs and cats were killed most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off the street Nathan and his boss saw this and they could not tolerate it so they set out to make San Francisco a no kill City create an entire city where every dog and cat unless it was Ill or dangerous would be adopted did not killed and everyone said it was impossible Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance and people from s SPCA and Humane shelters from around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane they persisted and Nathan went directly to the community he connected with people who cared about this nonprofessionals people with passion and within just a couple years San Francisco became the first no kill City running no deficit completely supported by the community Nathan left and went to Tomkins County New York a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States and he did it again he went from being a glorified dog catcher to completely transforming the community and then he went to North Carolina and did it again and he went to Reno and he did it again and when I think about what Nathan did and when I think about people here do I think about ideas and I think about the idea that creating an idea spreading an idea has a lot behind it and I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding but what they do is they take a light bulb and um They smash it now there's a bunch of reasons for that and stories about it but one reason is because it indicates a change from before to after it's a moment in time and I want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented we started with the factory idea that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient Factory that could turn out change we then went to the TV idea that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece if you could get on TV enough times if you could buy enough ads you could win and now we're in this new model of leadership where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system but by Leading so let me talk about the three Cycles the first one is the factory cycle Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea it enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay him $5 a day because he's got an efficient enough Factory well with that sort of Advantage you can churn out a lot of cars you can make a lot of change you can get roads built you can change the fabric of an entire country that the essence of what you're doing is you need ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines and the problem we've run into is we're running out of both ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines so we shift gears for a minute and say I know television avertising push push take a good idea and push it on the world I have a better mouse trap and if I can just get enough money to tell enough people I'll sell enough and you can build an entire industry on that if necessary you can put babies in your ads if necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff and if babies don't work you can use doctors but be careful because you don't want to get an unfortunate Dr to position when you're talking about one thing instead of the other this model requires you to act like the the king like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back that you are in charge and you're going to tell people what to do next that you know the quick little diagram of it is you're up here and you are pushing it out to the world this Method mass marketing requires average ideas because you're going to the masses and plenty of ads what we've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate and unfortunately it doesn't work so well anymore either but there's good news around the corner really good news I call it the idea of tribes what tribes are is a very simple concept that goes back 50,000 years it's it's about leading and connecting people and ideas and it's something that people have wanted forever lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe or a church tribe having a work tribe having a community tribe but now thanks to the Internet thanks to the explosion of mass media thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world tribes are everywhere the internet was supposed to homogenize Everyone by connecting us all instead what it's allowed is silos of Interest so you got the Red Hat Ladies over here you got the red hat triathletes over there you got the organized armies over here you got the disorganized rebels over here you got people in white hats making food and people in white hats sailing boats the point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them because you want to be connected that people on the fringes can find each other connect and go somewhere every town that has a volunteer fire department understand understands this way of thinking now it turns out this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo people I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon and that what firemen do to Train sometimes is they take a house that's going to be torn down and they burn it down instead and practice putting it out but they always stop and take a picture so you know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one they got their own flag they got the eye patches you can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe and it turns out that it's tribes not money not factories that can change our world that can change politics that can align large numbers of people not CU you forc them to do something against their will but because they wanted to connect that what we do for a living now all of us I think is find something worth changing and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea and it becomes something far bigger than ourselves it becomes a movement so when Al Gore set out to change the world again he didn't do it by himself and he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads he did it by creating a movement thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night you don't need everyone what Kevin Kelly has taught us is you just need I don't know a thousand true fans a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round that means that the idea you create the product you create the movement you create isn't for everyone it's not a mass thing that's not what this is about what it's about instead is finding the True Believers it's easy to look at what I've said so far and say wait a minute I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader so here are two leaders they don't have a lot in common they're about the same age but that's about it what they did though is each in their own way created a different way of navigating your way through technology so some people would go out and get people to be on one team and some people will get people to be on the other team it also informs the decisions you make when you make products or Serv Services you know this is one of my favorite devices but what a shame that it's not organized to help authors create movements what would happen if when you're using your Kindle you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment or from your book group or from your friends or from the circle you want what would happen if authors or people with ideas could use version two which comes out on Monday and use it to organize people who want to talk talk about something now there's a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here but let me just try a couple The Beatles did not invent teenagers they merely decided to lead them that most movements most leadership they were doing is about finding a group that's disconnected but already has a yearning not persuading people to want something they don't have yet when Diane hats worked on the metrix her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan she didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue but she helped organize people and helped turn it into a movement Ugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of Venezuela he merely LED them Bob Marley did not invent rosarians he just stepped up and said follow me Derek cers invented CD Baby which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man to have a place to take the mission they already wanted to go to and connect with each other what all these people have in common is that they are Heretics that Heretics look at the status quo and say this will not stand I can't abide this status quo I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward I see what the status quo is I don't like it that instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them that instead of of being what I call a sheep Walker somebody who's half asleep following instructions keeping their head down fitting in every once in a while someone stands up and says not me someone stands up and says this one's important we need to organize around it and not everyone will but you don't need everyone you just need a few people who will look at the rules realize they make no sense and realize how much they want to be connected so Tony Shay does not run a shoe store zapo isn't a shoe store zapo is the one the only the best there ever was place for people who are into shoes to find each other to talk about their passion to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow it can be something as prosaic as shoes and something as complicated as overthrowing a government it's exactly the same behavior though what it requires as Geraldine Carter has discovered is to be able to say I can't do this by myself but if I can get other people to join my climate ride then together we can get something that we all want we just waiting for someone to lead us Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture she doesn't do it by quiet L building one house at a time she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it by connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other by Leading a movement and making change and around and around and around it goes so three questions I'd offer you the first one is who exactly are you upsetting cuz if you're not upsetting anyone you're not changing the Status Quo the second question is who are you connecting because for a lot of people that's what they're in it for the connections that are being made one to the other and the third one is who are you leading because focusing on that part of it not the mechanics of what you're building but The Who and the leading part is where change comes so you know Blake at Tom shoes had a very simple idea what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes I gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn't even own a pair of shoes this is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus it's a story of a product that tells a story and as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says what are those you get to tell the story on Blake's behalf on behalf of the people who got the shoes and suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 Pair of Shoes it's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes my friend red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes not fighting the organization that's fighting it fighting with them leading them connecting them challenging the status quo because it's important to him and the people he surrounds himself with need the connection they need the leadership it makes a difference you don't need permission from people to lead them but in case you do here it is they're waiting we're waiting for you to show us where to go next so here's what leaders have in common the first thing is they challenge the status quo they challenge what's currently there the second thing is they build a culture a secret language a seven-second handshake a way of knowing that you're in or out they have curiosity curiosity about the people in the tribe curiosity about Outsiders they're asking questions they connect people to one another do you know what people want more than anything they want to be missed they want to be missed the day they don't show up they want to be missed when they're gone and tribe leaders can do that and it's fascinating because all tribe leaders have Charisma but you don't need Charisma to become a leader being a leader gives you Charisma and if you look and study the leaders who have succeeded that's where Charisma comes from from the leading and finally they commit they commit to the cause they commit to the tribe they commit to the people who are there so I'd like you to do something for me and I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out of hand what I want you to do it only takes 24 hours is create a movement something that matters start do it we need it thank you very much I appreciate [Music] it

way of thinking now it turns out this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo people I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon and that what firemen do to Train sometimes is they take a house that's going to be torn down and they burn it down instead and practice putting it out but they always stop and take a picture so you know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one they got their own flag they got the eye patches you can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe and it turns out that it's tribes not money not factories that can change our world that can change politics that can align large numbers of people not CU you forc them to do something against their will but because they wanted to connect that what we do for a living now all of us I think is find something worth changing and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea and it becomes something far bigger than ourselves it becomes a movement so when Al Gore set out to change the world again he didn't do it by himself and he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads he did it by creating a movement thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night you don't need everyone what Kevin Kelly has taught us is you just need I don't know a thousand true fans a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round that means that the idea you create the product you create the movement you create isn't for everyone it's not a mass thing that's not what this is about what it's about instead is finding the True Believers it's easy to look at what I've said so far and say wait a minute I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader so here are two leaders they don't have a lot in common they're about the same age but that's about it what they did though is each in their own way created a different way of navigating your way through technology so some people would go out and get people to be on one team and some people will get people to be on the other team it also informs the decisions you make when you make products or Serv Services you know this is one of my favorite devices but what a shame that it's not organized to help authors create movements what would happen if when you're using your Kindle you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment or from your book group or from your friends or from the circle you want what would happen if authors or people with ideas could use version two which comes out on Monday and use it to organize people who want to talk talk about something now there's a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here but let me just try a couple The Beatles did not invent teenagers they merely decided to lead them that most movements most leadership they were doing is about finding a group that's disconnected but already has a yearning not persuading people to want something they don't have yet when Diane hats worked on the metrix her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan she didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue but she helped organize people and helped turn it into a movement Ugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of Venezuela he merely LED them Bob Marley did not invent rosarians he just stepped up and said follow me Derek cers invented CD Baby which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man to have a place to take the mission they already wanted to go to and connect with each other what all these people have in common is that they are Heretics that Heretics look at the status quo and say this will not stand I can't abide this status quo I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward I see what the status quo is I don't like it that instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them that instead of of being what I call a sheep Walker somebody who's half asleep following instructions keeping their head down fitting in every once in a while someone stands up and says not me someone stands up and says this one's important we need to organize around it and not everyone will but you don't need everyone you just need a few people who will look at the rules realize they make no sense and realize how much they want to be connected so Tony Shay does not run a shoe store zapo isn't a shoe store zapo is the one the only the best there ever was place for people who are into shoes to find each other to talk about their passion to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow it can be something as prosaic as shoes and something as complicated as overthrowing a government it's exactly the same behavior though what it requires as Geraldine Carter has discovered is to be able to say I can't do this by myself but if I can get other people to join my climate ride then together we can get something that we all want we just waiting for someone to lead us Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture she doesn't do it by quiet L building one house at a time she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it by connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other by Leading a movement and making change and around and around and around it goes so three questions I'd offer you the first one is who exactly are you upsetting cuz if you're not upsetting anyone you're not changing the Status Quo the second question is who are you connecting because for a lot of people that's what they're in it for the connections that are being made one to the other and the third one is who are you leading because focusing on that part of it not the mechanics of what you're building but The Who and the leading part is where change comes so you know Blake at Tom shoes had a very simple idea what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes I gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn't even own a pair of shoes this is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus it's a story of a product that tells a story and as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says what are those you get to tell the story on Blake's behalf on behalf of the people who got the shoes and suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 Pair of Shoes it's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes my friend red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes not fighting the organization that's fighting it fighting with them leading them connecting them challenging the status quo because it's important to him and the people he surrounds himself with need the connection they need the leadership it makes a difference you don't need permission from people to lead them but in case you do here it is they're waiting we're waiting for you to show us where to go next so here's what leaders have in common the first thing is they challenge the status quo they challenge what's currently there the second thing is they build a culture a secret language a seven-second handshake a way of knowing that you're in or out they have curiosity curiosity about the people in the tribe curiosity about Outsiders they're asking questions they connect people to one another do you know what people want more than anything they want to be missed they want to be missed the day they don't show up they want to be missed when they're gone and tribe leaders can do that and it's fascinating because all tribe leaders have Charisma but you don't need Charisma to become a leader being a leader gives you Charisma and if you look and study the leaders who have succeeded that's where Charisma comes from from the leading and finally they commit they commit to the cause they commit to the tribe they commit to the people who are there so I'd like you to do something for me and I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out of hand what I want you to do it only takes 24 hours is create a movement something that matters start do it we need it thank you very much I appreciate [Music] it

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so sometimes I get invited to give weird talks uh I got invited to speak to the people who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes to perform at sporting events unfortunately I I couldn't go but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys at least most of them know what it is that they do for a living what they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events shortly after that I got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals and again I couldn't go but it's a fascinating group they make balloon animals there's a big Schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals but they do a lot of really cool stuff with sometimes they get in trouble but not often and the other thing about these guys is they also know what they do for a living they make balloon animals but what do we do for a living what exactly do the people watching this do every day and I want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything that we try to find a piece of the status quo something that bothers us something that needs to be improved something that's itching to be changed and we change it and we try to make big permanent important change but we don't think about it that way and we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like and I've been studying it for a couple years and I want to share a couple stories with you today first about a guy named Nathan winegrad Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA and what you may not know about the history of the sbca is it was founded to kill dogs and cats cities gave them a charter to get rid of the Stray animals on the street and Destroy them and in a typical year 4 million dogs and cats were killed most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off the street Nathan and his boss saw this and they could not tolerate it so they set out to make San Francisco a no kill City create an entire city where every dog and cat unless it was Ill or dangerous would be adopted did not killed and everyone said it was impossible Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance and people from s SPCA and Humane shelters from around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane they persisted and Nathan went directly to the community he connected with people who cared about this nonprofessionals people with passion and within just a couple years San Francisco became the first no kill City running no deficit completely supported by the community Nathan left and went to Tomkins County New York a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States and he did it again he went from being a glorified dog catcher to completely transforming the community and then he went to North Carolina and did it again and he went to Reno and he did it again and when I think about what Nathan did and when I think about people here do I think about ideas and I think about the idea that creating an idea spreading an idea has a lot behind it and I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding but what they do is they take a light bulb and um They smash it now there's a bunch of reasons for that and stories about it but one reason is because it indicates a change from before to after it's a moment in time and I want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented we started with the factory idea that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient Factory that could turn out change we then went to the TV idea that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece if you could get on TV enough times if you could buy enough ads you could win and now we're in this new model of leadership where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system but by Leading so let me talk about the three Cycles the first one is the factory cycle Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea it enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay him $5 a day because he's got an efficient enough Factory well with that sort of Advantage you can churn out a lot of cars you can make a lot of change you can get roads built you can change the fabric of an entire country that the essence of what you're doing is you need ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines and the problem we've run into is we're running out of both ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines so we shift gears for a minute and say I know television avertising push push take a good idea and push it on the world I have a better mouse trap and if I can just get enough money to tell enough people I'll sell enough and you can build an entire industry on that if necessary you can put babies in your ads if necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff and if babies don't work you can use doctors but be careful because you don't want to get an unfortunate Dr to position when you're talking about one thing instead of the other this model requires you to act like the the king like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back that you are in charge and you're going to tell people what to do next that you know the quick little diagram of it is you're up here and you are pushing it out to the world this Method mass marketing requires average ideas because you're going to the masses and plenty of ads what we've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate and unfortunately it doesn't work so well anymore either but there's good news around the corner really good news I call it the idea of tribes what tribes are is a very simple concept that goes back 50,000 years it's it's about leading and connecting people and ideas and it's something that people have wanted forever lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe or a church tribe having a work tribe having a community tribe but now thanks to the Internet thanks to the explosion of mass media thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world tribes are everywhere the internet was supposed to homogenize Everyone by connecting us all instead what it's allowed is silos of Interest so you got the Red Hat Ladies over here you got the red hat triathletes over there you got the organized armies over here you got the disorganized rebels over here you got people in white hats making food and people in white hats sailing boats the point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them because you want to be connected that people on the fringes can find each other connect and go somewhere every town that has a volunteer fire department understand understands this way of thinking now it turns out this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo people I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon and that what firemen do to Train sometimes is they take a house that's going to be torn down and they burn it down instead and practice putting it out but they always stop and take a picture so you know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one they got their own flag they got the eye patches you can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe and it turns out that it's tribes not money not factories that can change our world that can change politics that can align large numbers of people not CU you forc them to do something against their will but because they wanted to connect that what we do for a living now all of us I think is find something worth changing and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea and it becomes something far bigger than ourselves it becomes a movement so when Al Gore set out to change the world again he didn't do it by himself and he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads he did it by creating a movement thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night you don't need everyone what Kevin Kelly has taught us is you just need I don't know a thousand true fans a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round that means that the idea you create the product you create the movement you create isn't for everyone it's not a mass thing that's not what this is about what it's about instead is finding the True Believers it's easy to look at what I've said so far and say wait a minute I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader so here are two leaders they don't have a lot in common they're about the same age but that's about it what they did though is each in their own way created a different way of navigating your way through technology so some people would go out and get people to be on one team and some people will get people to be on the other team it also informs the decisions you make when you make products or Serv Services you know this is one of my favorite devices but what a shame that it's not organized to help authors create movements what would happen if when you're using your Kindle you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment or from your book group or from your friends or from the circle you want what would happen if authors or people with ideas could use version two which comes out on Monday and use it to organize people who want to talk talk about something now there's a million things I

and I want to share a couple stories with you today first about a guy named Nathan winegrad Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA and what you may not know about the history of the sbca is it was founded to kill dogs and cats cities gave them a charter to get rid of the Stray animals on the street and Destroy them and in a typical year 4 million dogs and cats were killed most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off the street Nathan and his boss saw this and they could not tolerate it so they set out to make San Francisco a no kill City create an entire city where every dog and cat unless it was Ill or dangerous would be adopted did not killed and everyone said it was impossible Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance and people from s SPCA and Humane shelters from around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane they persisted and Nathan went directly to the community he connected with people who cared about this nonprofessionals people with passion and within just a couple years San Francisco became the first no kill City running no deficit completely supported by the community Nathan left and went to Tomkins County New York a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States and he did it again he went from being a glorified dog catcher to completely transforming the community and then he went to North Carolina and did it again and he went to Reno and he did it again and when I think about what Nathan did and when I think about people here do I think about ideas and I think about the idea that creating an idea spreading an idea has a lot behind it and I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding but what they do is they take a light bulb and um They smash it now there's a bunch of reasons for that and stories about it but one reason is because it indicates a change from before to after it's a moment in time and I want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented we started with the factory idea that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient Factory that could turn out change we then went to the TV idea that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece if you could get on TV enough times if you could buy enough ads you could win and now we're in this new model of leadership where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system but by Leading so let me talk about the three Cycles the first one is the factory cycle Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea it enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay him $5 a day because he's got an efficient enough Factory well with that sort of Advantage you can churn out a lot of cars you can make a lot of change you can get roads built you can change the fabric of an entire country that the essence of what you're doing is you need ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines and the problem we've run into is we're running out of both ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines so we shift gears for a minute and say I know television avertising push push take a good idea and push it on the world I have a better mouse trap and if I can just get enough money to tell enough people I'll sell enough and you can build an entire industry on that if necessary you can put babies in your ads if necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff and if babies don't work you can use doctors but be careful because you don't want to get an unfortunate Dr to position when you're talking about one thing instead of the other this model requires you to act like the the king like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back that you are in charge and you're going to tell people what to do next that you know the quick little diagram of it is you're up here and you are pushing it out to the world this Method mass marketing requires average ideas because you're going to the masses and plenty of ads what we've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate and unfortunately it doesn't work so well anymore either but there's good news around the corner really good news I call it the idea of tribes what tribes are is a very simple concept that goes back 50,000 years it's it's about leading and connecting people and ideas and it's something that people have wanted forever lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe or a church tribe having a work tribe having a community tribe but now thanks to the Internet thanks to the explosion of mass media thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world tribes are everywhere the internet was supposed to homogenize Everyone by connecting us all instead what it's allowed is silos of Interest so you got the Red Hat Ladies over here you got the red hat triathletes over there you got the organized armies over here you got the disorganized rebels over here you got people in white hats making food and people in white hats sailing boats the point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them because you want to be connected that people on the fringes can find each other connect and go somewhere every town that has a volunteer fire department understand understands this way of thinking now it turns out this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo people I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon and that what firemen do to Train sometimes is they take a house that's going to be torn down and they burn it down instead and practice putting it out but they always stop and take a picture so you know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one they got their own flag they got the eye patches you can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe and it turns out that it's tribes not money not factories that can change our world that can change politics that can align large numbers of people not CU you forc them to do something against their will but because they wanted to connect that what we do for a living now all of us I think is find something worth changing and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea and it becomes something far bigger than ourselves it becomes a movement so when Al Gore set out to change the world again he didn't do it by himself and he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads he did it by creating a movement thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night you don't need everyone what Kevin Kelly has taught us is you just need I don't know a thousand true fans a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round that means that the idea you create the product you create the movement you create isn't for everyone it's not a mass thing that's not what this is about what it's about instead is finding the True Believers it's easy to look at what I've said so far and say wait a minute I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader so here are two leaders they don't have a lot in common they're about the same age but that's about it what they did though is each in their own way created a different way of navigating your way through technology so some people would go out and get people to be on one team and some people will get people to be on the other team it also informs the decisions you make when you make products or Serv Services you know this is one of my favorite devices but what a shame that it's not organized to help authors create movements what would happen if when you're using your Kindle you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment or from your book group or from your friends or from the circle you want what would happen if authors or people with ideas could use version two which comes out on Monday and use it to organize people who want to talk talk about something now there's a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here but let me just try a couple The Beatles did not invent teenagers they merely decided to lead them that most movements most leadership they were doing is about finding a group that's disconnected but already has a yearning not persuading people to want something they don't have yet when Diane hats worked on the metrix her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan she didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue but she helped organize people and helped turn it into a movement Ugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of Venezuela he merely LED them Bob Marley did not invent rosarians he just stepped up and said follow me Derek cers invented CD Baby which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man to have a place to take the mission they already wanted to go to and connect with each other what all these people have in common is that they are Heretics that Heretics look at the status quo and say this will not stand I can't abide this status quo I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward I see what the status quo is I don't like it that instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them that instead of of being what I call a sheep Walker somebody who's half asleep following instructions keeping their head down fitting in every once in a while someone stands up and says not me someone stands up and says this one's important we need to organize around it and not everyone will but you don't need everyone you just need a few people who will look at the rules realize they make no sense and realize how much they want to be connected so Tony Shay does not run a shoe store zapo isn't a shoe store zapo is the one the only the best there ever was place for people who are into shoes to find each other to talk about their passion to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow it can be something as prosaic as shoes and something as complicated as overthrowing a government it's exactly the same behavior though what it requires as Geraldine Carter has discovered is to be able to say I can't do this by myself but if I can get other people to join my climate ride then together we can get something that we all want we just waiting for someone to lead us Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture she doesn't do it by quiet L building one house at a time she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it by connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other by Leading a movement and making change and around and around and around it goes so three questions I'd offer you the first one is who exactly are you upsetting cuz if you're not upsetting anyone you're not changing the Status Quo the second question is who are you connecting because for a lot of people that's what they're in it for the connections that are being made one to the other and the third one is who are you leading because focusing on that part of it not the mechanics of what you're building but The Who and the leading part is where change comes so you know Blake at Tom shoes had a very simple idea what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes I gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn't even own a pair of shoes this is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus it's a story of a product that tells a story and as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says what are those you get to tell the story on Blake's behalf on behalf of the people who got the shoes and suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 Pair of Shoes it's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes my friend red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes not fighting the organization that's fighting it fighting with them leading them connecting them challenging the status quo because it's important to him and the people he surrounds himself with need the connection they need the leadership it makes a difference you don't need permission from people to lead them but in case you do here it is they're waiting we're waiting for you to show us where to go next so here's what leaders have in common the first thing is they challenge the status quo they challenge what's currently there the second thing is they build a culture a secret language a seven-second handshake a way of knowing that you're in or out they have curiosity curiosity about the people in the tribe curiosity about Outsiders they're asking questions they connect people to one another do you know what people want more than anything they want to be missed they want to be missed the day they don't show up they want to be missed when they're gone and tribe leaders can do that and it's fascinating because all tribe leaders have Charisma but you don't need Charisma to become a leader being a leader gives you Charisma and if you look and study the leaders who have succeeded that's where Charisma comes from from the leading and finally they commit they commit to the cause they commit to the tribe they commit to the people who are there so I'd like you to do something for me and I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out of hand what I want you to do it only takes 24 hours is create a movement something that matters start do it we need it thank you very much I appreciate [Music] it

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so sometimes I get invited to give weird talks uh I got invited to speak to the people who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes to perform at sporting events unfortunately I I couldn't go but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys at least most of them know what it is that they do for a living what they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events shortly after that I got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals and again I couldn't go but it's a fascinating group they make balloon animals there's a big Schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals but they do a lot of really cool stuff with sometimes they get in trouble but not often and the other thing about these guys is they also know what they do for a living they make balloon animals but what do we do for a living what exactly do the people watching this do every day and I want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything that we try to find a piece of the status quo something that bothers us something that needs to be improved something that's itching to be changed and we change it and we try to make big permanent important change but we don't think about it that way and we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like and I've been studying it for a couple years

[Music] [Applause] I want to talk about the election for the first time in the United States a predominantly white group of Voters voted for an African-American candidate for president and in fact Barack Obama did quite well he won 375 electoral votes and he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate of any race of any party in history if you compare how Obama did against how John krey had done four years earlier Democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes Bluer becomes more democratic even States Obama lost like out west those States became more blue in the south in the Northeast almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there um one exception is in Massachusetts that was John K 's home state no big surprise Obama couldn't do better than Carrie there or in Arizona which is John McCain's home Obama didn't have much improvement but there's also this part of the country kind of in the middle region here this kind of Arkansas Tennessee Oklahoma West Virginia region now if you look at 96 Bill Clinton the last Democrat to actually win how he did in 96 you see real big differences in this part of the country right here the kind of Appalachians Ozarks Highlands region as I call it 20 or 30 point swings from how Bill Clinton did in 96 to how Obama did in 2008 Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas these are very very profound differences so when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas you know and there's a book written called what's the matter with Kansas but really the question here Obama did relatively well in Kansas he lost badly but every Democrat does he lost no worse than most people do but yeah what's the matter with Arkansas and when we think of Arkansa we tend to have pretty negative connotations we think of a bunch of rednecks quote unquote with guns and we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama we think it's a matter of race and is this Fair are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas and this part of the country and the answer is it is at least partially fair and we know that race was a factor and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people I'm actually we didn't ask them but when they conducted exit polls in every state in 37 States out of the 50 they asked a question that was pretty direct about race they asked this question in deciding your vote for president today was the race of the candidate a factor we're looking for people that said yes race was a factor moreover it was an important factor in my decision and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor maybe in combination with other factors maybe alone and we're looking for this Behavior among white voters or really uh non-black voters so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question in Louisiana about one in five white voters said yes one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African-American if those people had voted for Obama even half of them Obama would have won Louisiana safely same is true with I think all of these states you see on the top of the list meanwhile California New York we can say oh we're enlightened but you know certainly much lower incidents of this admitted I suppose manifestation of racially based voting here's the same data on a map and you kind of see the relationship between the redder states are where more people responded and said yes Barack Obama race was a problem for me and you see comparing the map to 96 you see an overlap here this really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country so we have to ask why is racism predictable in some way is there something driving this is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand in Kentucky or are there more systematic factors that work and so we can look at a bunch of different variables these are the things that economists and political scientists look at all the time things like income and religion education which of these seem to drive um this manifestation of racism in this big natural experiment we had on November 4th and there are a couple of these that that have strong predictive relationships one of which is education where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red and you see this part of the country the kind of Appalachians region is less educated it's just a fact and you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns the other variable that's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in uh states that are more rural even to some extent States like New Hampshire and Maine they exhibited a little bit of this kind of racially based voting against Barack Obama so it's the combination of these two things it's education and the type of neighbors that you have which we'll talk about more in a moment and the thing about States like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they're both very rural and they're educationally impoverished so yes racism is predictable these things among maybe other variables but these things seem to predict it we're going to like drill down a little bit more now into something called The General Social Survey this is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year and they asked a series of really interesting questions in 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes and one simple question they ask is does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood and we can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different in cities about 80% of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race but in rural communities only about 30% probably because if you live on a farm you might not have a lot of neighbors period but nevertheless you're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you so what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors or really some neighbor of another race and people who have only white neighbors and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes not a lot of difference This was um 8 years ago were more Republican back then but you see Democrats verus Republican not a big difference based on who your neighbors are and even some questions about race for example affirmative action which is kind of a political question a policy question about race if you will not much difference here affirmative action is not very popular frankly with white voters period but people with black neighbors and people in monoracial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really but if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more kind of personal if you will do you favor a law Banning interracial marriage there's a difference people who don't have neighbors of A different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you and likewise they asked not in 2000 but in the same survey 1996 would you not vote for a qualified black president and you see people without neighbors who are African-American were much more likely to say that would give me a problem so it's really not even about Urban versus rural it's about kind of who you live with and racism is predictable it's predicted by an interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you people of other races so if we want to address it the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races and I have a couple of very obvious I suppose ideas for maybe how to do that I'm a big fan of cities especially if we have cities that are diverse and sustainable and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups I think cities facilitate more the kind of networking and kind of casual interaction that you might have on a daily basis but also not everyone wants to live in a City certainly not a city like New York so we can think more about things like Street grids this is the neighborhood where I grew up in East laning Michigan it's a traditional Midwestern Community which means you have a real grid you have real neighborhoods and real trees and real streets you can walk on and you interact a lot with your neighbors people you like people you might not know um and as a result a very tolerant Community which is different I think than something like this which is in shamberg Illinois where kind of every little set of houses has their own cool toac and kind of drive through Starbucks and stuff like that I think that actually this type of Urban Design which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s I think there's a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan um but also here's another idea we have is an interc Colgate Exchange program where you have students going from New York abroad but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from myu have them go study for semester at the University of Arkansas and vice versa are do it at the high school level literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from um another part of the country or of another racial group and I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do kind of get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise but the point is this is all good news because when something is uh predictable it's what I call designable we can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem even a problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism if we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't we can start to design solutions to it so that's all I have to say thank you very [Applause] much

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I want to talk about the election for the first time in the United States a predominantly white group of Voters voted for an African-American candidate for president and in fact Barack Obama did quite well he won 375 electoral votes and he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate of any race of any party in history if you compare how Obama did against how John krey had done four years earlier Democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes Bluer becomes more democratic even States Obama lost like out west those States became more blue in the south in the Northeast almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there um one exception is in Massachusetts that was John K 's home state no big surprise Obama couldn't do better than Carrie there or in Arizona which is John McCain's home Obama didn't have much improvement but there's also this part of the country kind of in the middle region here this kind of Arkansas Tennessee Oklahoma West Virginia region now if you look at 96 Bill Clinton the last Democrat to actually win how he did in 96 you see real big differences in this part of the country right here the kind of Appalachians Ozarks Highlands region as I call it 20 or 30 point swings from how Bill Clinton did in 96 to how Obama did in 2008 Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas these are very very profound differences so when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas you know and there's a book written called what's the matter with Kansas but really the question here Obama did relatively well in Kansas he lost badly but every Democrat does he lost no worse than most people do but yeah what's the matter with Arkansas and when we think of Arkansa we tend to have pretty negative connotations we think of a bunch of rednecks quote unquote with guns and we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama we think it's a matter of race and is this Fair are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas and this part of the country and the answer is it is at least partially fair and we know that race was a factor and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people I'm actually we didn't ask them but when they conducted exit polls in every state in 37 States out of the 50 they asked a question that was pretty direct about race they asked this question in deciding your vote for president today was the race of the candidate a factor we're looking for people that said yes race was a factor moreover it was an important factor in my decision and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor maybe in combination with other factors maybe alone and we're looking for this Behavior among white voters or really uh non-black voters so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question in Louisiana about one in five white voters said yes one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African-American if those people had voted for Obama even half of them Obama would have won Louisiana safely same is true with I think all of these states you see on the top of the list meanwhile California New York we can say oh we're enlightened but you know certainly much lower incidents of this admitted I suppose manifestation of racially based voting here's the same data on a map and you kind of see the relationship between the redder states are where more people responded and said yes Barack Obama race was a problem for me and you see comparing the map to 96 you see an overlap here this really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country so we have to ask why is racism predictable in some way is there something driving this is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand in Kentucky or are there more systematic factors that work and so we can look at a bunch of different variables these are the things that economists and political scientists look at all the time things like income and religion education which of these seem to drive um this manifestation of racism in this big natural experiment we had on November 4th and there are a couple of these that that have strong predictive relationships one of which is education where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red and you see this part of the country the kind of Appalachians region is less educated it's just a fact and you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns the other variable that's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in uh states that are more rural even to some extent States like New Hampshire and Maine they exhibited a little bit of this kind of racially based voting against Barack Obama so it's the combination of these two things it's education and the type of neighbors that you have which we'll talk about more in a moment and the thing about States like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they're both very rural and they're educationally impoverished so yes racism is predictable these things among maybe other variables but these things seem to predict it we're going to like drill down a little bit more now into something called The General Social Survey this is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year and they asked a series of really interesting questions in 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes and one simple question they ask is does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood and we can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different in cities about 80% of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race but in rural communities only about 30% probably because if you live on a farm you might not have a lot of neighbors period but nevertheless you're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you so what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors or really some neighbor of another race and people who have only white neighbors and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes not a lot of difference This was um 8 years ago were more Republican back then but you see Democrats verus Republican not a big difference based on who your neighbors are and even some questions about race for example affirmative action which is kind of a political question a policy question about race if you will not much difference here affirmative action is not very popular frankly with white voters period but people with black neighbors and people in monoracial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really but if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more kind of personal if you will do you favor a law Banning interracial marriage there's a difference people who don't have neighbors of A different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you and likewise they asked not in 2000 but in the same survey 1996 would you not vote for a qualified black president and you see people without neighbors who are African-American were much more likely to say that would give me a problem so it's really not even about Urban versus rural it's about kind of who you live with and racism is predictable it's predicted by an interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you people of other races so if we want to address it the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races and I have a couple of very obvious I suppose ideas for maybe how to do that I'm a big fan of cities especially if we have cities that are diverse and sustainable and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups I think cities facilitate more the kind of networking and kind of casual interaction that you might have on a daily basis but also not everyone wants to live in a City certainly not a city like New York so we can think more about things like Street grids this is the neighborhood where I grew up in East laning Michigan it's a traditional Midwestern Community which means you have a real grid you have real neighborhoods and real trees and real streets you can walk on and you interact a lot with your neighbors people you like people you might not know um and as a result a very tolerant Community which is different I think than something like this which is in shamberg Illinois where kind of every little set of houses has their own cool toac and kind of drive through Starbucks and stuff like that I think that actually this type of Urban Design which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s I think there's a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan um but also here's another idea we have is an interc Colgate Exchange program where you have students going from New York abroad but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from myu have them go study for semester at the University of Arkansas and vice versa are do it at the high school level literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from um another part of the country or of another racial group and I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do kind of get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise but the point is this is all good news because when something is uh predictable it's what I call designable we can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem even a problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism if we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't we can start to design solutions to it so that's all I have to say thank you very [Applause] much

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the list. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can infer that the closest match would be a question that mentions education as a factor that drives racism or predicts voter registration.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the closest match, as it mentions that the type of neighborhood a person lives in can influence their racial attitudes. Although it does not explicitly mention education, it is related to the topic of how environmental factors can shape racial attitudes.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one, I would choose Question 7, as it is the closest match in terms of content and intent.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 7

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list. The ground truth MCQ asks about the name of the survey that the University of Chicago conducted, which is the General Social Survey.

However, I can suggest that Question 4 is the closest match in terms of content, as it mentions the General Social Survey and some of its findings. But it does not ask about the name of the survey, so it is not a direct match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, but with the caveat that it is not a direct match.

Index: 4

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I want to talk about the election for the first time in the United States a predominantly white group of Voters voted for an African-American candidate for president and in fact Barack Obama did quite well he won 375 electoral votes and he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate of any race of any party in history if you compare how Obama did against how John krey had done four years earlier Democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes Bluer becomes more democratic even States Obama lost like out west those States became more blue in the south in the Northeast almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there um one exception is in Massachusetts that was John K 's home state no big surprise Obama couldn't do better than Carrie there or in Arizona which is John McCain's home Obama didn't have much improvement but there's also this part of the country kind of in the middle region here this kind of Arkansas Tennessee Oklahoma West Virginia region now if you look at 96 Bill Clinton the last Democrat to actually win how he did in 96 you see real big differences in this part of the country right here the kind of Appalachians Ozarks Highlands region as I call it 20 or 30 point swings from how Bill Clinton did in 96 to how Obama did in 2008 Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas these are very very profound differences so when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas you know and there's a book written called what's the matter with Kansas but really the question here Obama did relatively well in Kansas he lost badly but every Democrat does he lost no worse than most people do but yeah what's the matter with Arkansas and when we think of Arkansa we tend to have pretty negative connotations we think of a bunch of rednecks quote unquote with guns and we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama we think it's a matter of race and is this Fair are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas and this part of the country and the answer is it is at least partially fair and we know that race was a factor and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people I'm actually we didn't ask them but when they conducted exit polls in every state in 37 States out of the 50 they asked a question that was pretty direct about race they asked this question in deciding your vote for president today was the race of the candidate a factor we're looking for people that said yes race was a factor moreover it was an important factor in my decision and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor maybe in combination with other factors maybe alone and we're looking for this Behavior among white voters or really uh non-black voters so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question in Louisiana about one in five white voters said yes one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African-American if those people had voted for Obama even half of them Obama would have won Louisiana safely same is true with I think all of these states you see on the top of the list meanwhile California New York we can say oh we're enlightened but you know certainly much lower incidents of this admitted I suppose manifestation of racially based voting here's the same data on a map and you kind of see the relationship between the redder states are where more people responded and said yes Barack Obama race was a problem for me and you see comparing the map to 96 you see an overlap here this really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country so we have to ask why is racism predictable in some way is there something driving this is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand in Kentucky or are there more systematic factors that work and so we can look at a bunch of different variables these are the things that economists and political scientists look at all the time things like income and religion education which of these seem to drive um this manifestation of racism in this big natural experiment we had on November 4th and there are a couple of these that that have strong predictive relationships one of which is education where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red and you see this part of the country the kind of Appalachians region is less educated it's just a fact and you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns the other variable that's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in uh states that are more rural even to some extent States like New Hampshire and Maine they exhibited a little bit of this kind of racially based voting against Barack Obama so it's the combination of these two things it's education and the type of neighbors that you have which we'll talk about more in a moment and the thing about States like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they're both very rural and they're educationally impoverished so yes racism is predictable these things among maybe other variables but these things seem to predict it we're going to like drill down a little bit more now into something called The General Social Survey this is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year and they asked a series of really interesting questions in 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes and one simple question they ask is does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood and we can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different in cities about 80% of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race but in rural communities only about 30% probably because if you live on a farm you might not have a lot of neighbors period but nevertheless you're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you so what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors or really some neighbor of another race and people who have only white neighbors and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes not a lot of difference This was um 8 years ago were more Republican back then but you see Democrats verus Republican not a big difference based on who your neighbors are and even some questions about race for example affirmative action which is kind of a political question a policy question about race if you will not much difference here affirmative action is not very popular frankly with white voters period but people with black neighbors and people in monoracial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really but if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more kind of personal if you will do you favor a law Banning interracial marriage there's a difference people who don't have neighbors of A different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you and likewise they asked not in 2000 but in the same survey 1996 would you not vote for a qualified black president and you see people without neighbors who are African-American were much more likely to say that would give me a problem so it's really not even about Urban versus rural it's about kind of who you live with and racism is predictable it's predicted by an interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you people of other races so if we want to address it the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races and I have a couple of very obvious I suppose ideas for maybe how to do that I'm a big fan of cities especially if we have cities that are diverse and sustainable and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups I think cities facilitate more the kind of networking and kind of casual interaction that you might have on a daily basis but also not everyone wants to live in a City certainly not a city like New York so we can think more about things like Street grids this is the neighborhood where I grew up in East laning Michigan it's a traditional Midwestern Community which means you have a real grid you have real neighborhoods and real trees and real streets you can walk on and you interact a lot with your neighbors people you like people you might not know um and as a result a very tolerant Community which is different I think than something like this which is in shamberg Illinois where kind of every little set of houses has their own cool toac and kind of drive through Starbucks and stuff like that I think that actually this type of Urban Design which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s I think there's a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan um but also here's another idea we have is an interc Colgate Exchange program where you have students going from New York abroad but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from myu have them go study for semester at the University of Arkansas and vice versa are do it at the high school level literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from um another part of the country or of another racial group and I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do kind of get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise but the point is this is all good news because when something is uh predictable it's what I call designable we can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem even a problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism if we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't we can start to design solutions to it so that's all I have to say thank you very [Applause] much

**Transcript**:
so how would you run a whole country without oil that's the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago and it never left my brain and I started playing with it more like puzzle the original thought I had this must be ethanol so I went out and researched ethanol and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country about six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen until some scientists told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car if you use hydrogen so that's not going to be the path to go and then sort of through a process of wandering around I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars in a way that is convenient and affordable you could get to a solution now I started this from a point of view that it's it has to be something that scales a mass not how do you build one car but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99% of the population the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today so one it has to be more convenient than a car and two has to be more affordable than today's cars and affordable is not a $40,000 sedan right that's not something we can finance or buy today inconvenient is not something you drive for an hour and charge Freight so we're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics and so the thought that that I started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up how do you do it within economics that we have today how do you do it from the power of the consumer up and not from the power of an edict down in on a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic batteries not included now if you separate between the two you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network by creating a network before the cars show up and the network has two components in them first component is you charge the car whenever you stop ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours in park for about 22 hours and if you drive a car in the morning you drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute and so the first thought that came to mind is everywhere we park we have electric power now it sounds crazy but in some places around the world like Scandinavia you already have that if you park your car and didn't plug in the heater when you come back you don't have a car it just doesn't work now that last mile last foot in a sense is the first step of the infrastructure the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension see we're bound by today's technology on batteries which is about a hundred and twenty miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and and wait limitations in a 120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people but you never want to get stuck and so what we added as a second element to our network which is a battery swap system you drive you take your depleted battery out a full battery comes on and you drive on and you don't do it as a human being you do it as a machine it looks like a car wash you come into your car wash and the plate comes up hold your battery takes it out and puts them back in and within two minutes you're back on the road and you can go again if you had charged spots everywhere and you had battery swap stations everywhere how often would you do it it ends up that you do swapping less times and you stop at a gas station as a matter of fact we add it to the contract we said that if you stopped to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience then we looked at the question of the affordability and we looked at the question what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car what is the cost of that battery everybody tells us batteries are so expensive and what we found out that when you move from molecules to electrons something interesting happens we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again the battery is not the gas stank in a sense remember in your car you have a gas tank you have the crude oil and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil is what we call petrol or gasoline the battery in this sense is the crude oil we have a battery bay it costs the same hundred dollar as the gas tank but the crude oil is replaced with a battery just it doesn't burn it consumes itself step after step it has 2000 life cycles these days and so it's sort of a mini well we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well for the life of the car nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car in a sense what we've done is we created a new consumable you today buy gasoline miles and we created electric miles and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number today 2010 in volume when we come to market it is eight cents a mile those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means in the average consumer environment we're in in the u.s. 20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50 a buck 60 a gallon that's cheaper than today's gasoline even in the u.s. in Europe where taxes are in place that's the equivalent to ace my nough $60 barrel but e miles follow Moore's law they go from 8 cents a mile in 2010 to 4 cents a mile in 2015 to 2 cents a mile by 2020 why because battery's life cycle improve a bit of improvement on energy density which reduces the price and these prices are actually with clean electron we do not use any electron that come from coal so in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 which is our desire imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road that is an 80 cent gallon 80 cent gala means if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil and we'll let any oil company bring it out and refine it they still can't compete with 2 cents a mile that's a new economic factor which is fascinating to most people now this would have been a wonderful paper so that's how I solved it in my head it was a white paper I handed out to governments and some governments told me that it's fascinating that the young generation actually thinks about these things until we got to the true young global leader Shimon Peres president of Israel and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me first he let me go to the prime minister of the country who told me if you can find the money you need for this network two hundred million dollars and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume in two million cars that's what we needed in Israel I'll give you a country to invest the 200 million into Paris thought that was a great idea so we went out and we we looked at all the car companies we send letters to all the car companies three of them never showed up one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they will give us a discount but one of them Carlos go and see over an O and Nissan when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating said hybrids are like mermaids when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish and gone came up and said I have the car mr. Paris I will build you the cars and he actually true to form Renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume mass volume being the first year a hundred thousand cars it's the first mass volume electric car zero emission electric car in the market I was running as Chris said to be the CEO of a large software company at called s AP and then Paris said well once you run this project and I said well I'm ready for CEO and he said no no no no no you got to explain to me what is more important than saving your country and saving the world that you would go and do and I had to quit and come do this thing called better place now we then decided to scale it up we went to other countries as I said we went to Denmark and Denmark said this beautiful policy it's called the IQ test it's inversely proportional to taxes they put a hundred and eighty percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero emission cars so if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark it cost you about sixty thousand euros if you buy our car it's about twenty thousand euro if you failed the IQ test they ask you to leave we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small island I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island but Israel is an island it's Transportation Island if your cars driving outside Israel it's been stolen and so if if you're thinking about it in terms of islands we decided to go to the biggest island we could find and that was Australia the third country we announced was Australia it's got three centres in Brisbane and Melbourne and Sydney and one freeway when electric free where they connect them the next Island was not too hard to find and that was Hawaii we decided to come into the US and pick the two best places the one where you didn't need any arranged extension Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery and if you really have a long day you can switch and keep on driving around the island and the second one was the San Francisco Bay Area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors he decided that he's going to take over the state unofficially and then officially and then created this beautiful region one policy and in San Francisco Bay and not only do you have the highest concentration of Priuses but you also have the perfect range extender it's called the other car now as we started scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the US why why is this a big issue and the most fascinating thing we've learned is that when you have small problems an individual level like the price of gasoline to drive every morning you don't notice it but when the aggregate comes up you're dead all right so the price of oil much like lots of other curves that we've seen goes along a depletion curve the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground and we'll keep getting wells that are further away from the ground he becomes more and more and more expensive to dig him out now you think well you know it's been up it's been down it's been up its gonna keep on going up and down here's the problem at 147 dollars a barrel which we were in six months ago the u.s. spent a ton of money to get oil then we lost our economy we went back down to 47 sometimes at 40 sometimes it's 50 now we're running a stimulus package it's called a trillion-dollar stimulus package we're gonna revive the economy hopefully it happens between now and 2015 somewhere in that space what happens when the economy recovers by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace were going at right now that's another 30 percent demand on oil that is another 25 million barrels a day that's all the u.s. usage today in other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak and then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as $200 a barrel we take our money and we give it away you know what happens at that point we go back down it's going to go up and down and the downs are gonna be much longer than the ups are gonna be much shorter and that's the difference between problems that are additive like co2 which we go slowly up and then we tip and problems that are depletive in which we lose what we have which oscillate in the oscillate until we lose everything we got now we actually looked at what the answer would be right remember in the campaign 1 million hybrid cars by 2015 that is 0.5% of the US oil consumption that is 0.0 well percent of the rest of the world that won't do much difference we looked at an MIT study 10 million electric cars on the global roads 10 million out of 500 million we will add between now and then that is the most pessimistic number you can have it's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from a hundred thousand cars in 2011 to 10 million cars by 2016 a hundred X growth in less than five years you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars we have 10 million cars by region that's an enormous amount of cars China is adding those cars India Russia Brazil we have all these region Europe has solved it they just put tax on gasoline they'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high China solves it by an edict at some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city and that will be it the Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on Range not a reduction in range we're the only ones who don't have the price set right don't have the industry set right don't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u.s. now whereas the car industry on that very interesting the car industry has been focused just on themselves they basically looked at it and said Carwin Auto will solve everything within the car itself no infrastructure no problem we forgot about the entire chain around us all this stuff that happens around we are looking at an emergence of a car to zero a whole new market a whole new business model a business model in which the money that is actually coming in to drive the car the minutes the miles if you want that you are all familiar with subsidized the price of the car just like cell phone you'll pay for the miles and some of it will go back to the car maker some of it will go back to your own pocket but our cars are actually gonna be cheaper than gasoline cars you're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills in Denmark we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills not from oil in Israel we've asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel and people said oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for we said what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years and I said what we tried there isn't any we said no no but what if we prove it and they say well you can dig and we decided to dig up instead of digging down these are perfect matches to one another now all you need is about 10% of the electricity generated think of it as a project that spans over about ten years that's 1% a year now when we're looking at solving big problems we need to start thinking in two numbers and those are not 20% by 2020 the two numbers are zero as in zero footprint or zero oil and scale at infinity and when we go to cop 15 at the end of this year we can't stop thinking at patting co2 we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale one car emits four tonnes and actually 700 and change million cars today I'm a at 2.8 billion tons of co2 that's in the additive about 25% of our problem cars and trucks add up to about 25% of the world's co2 emissions we have to come and attack this problem with a focus with an effort that actually says we're gonna go to zero before the world ends I actually share that with some legislators here in the US I shared it with with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr who's one of my idols and I told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remember it is because he said we're gonna send a man to the moon and we'll do it by the end of the decade we didn't say we're gonna send a man 20% to the moon and they'll be about 20% chance we'll recover him he actually shared with me another story which is from about 200 years ago 200 years ago in Parliament in Great Britain there was a long argument over economy versus morality 25 percent just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars 25 percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in in the UK came from a source of energy that was immoral human slaves and there was an argument should we stop using slaves and what would it do to our economy and people say what we need to take time to do it let's not do it immediately maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves and after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery and the Industrial Revolution started within less than one year in the UK had a hundred years of economic growth we have to make the right moral decision we have to make it immediately we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in Israel that said we were Ndoye 'el and we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years but within this presidential term because if we don't we will lose our economy right after we lost our morality thank you all very much you

**Transcript**:
so how would you run a whole country without oil that's the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago and it never left my brain and I started playing with it more like puzzle the original thought I had this must be ethanol so I went out and researched ethanol and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country about six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen until some scientists told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car if you use hydrogen so that's not going to be the path to go and then sort of through a process of wandering around I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars in a way that is convenient and affordable you could get to a solution now I started this from a point of view that it's it has to be something that scales a mass not how do you build one car but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99% of the population the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today so one it has to be more convenient than a car and two has to be more affordable than today's cars and affordable is not a $40,000 sedan right that's not something we can finance or buy today inconvenient is not something you drive for an hour and charge Freight so we're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics and so the thought that that I started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up how do you do it within economics that we have today how do you do it from the power of the consumer up and not from the power of an edict down in on a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic batteries not included now if you separate between the two you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network by creating a network before the cars show up and the network has two components in them first component is you charge the car whenever you stop ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours in park for about 22 hours and if you drive a car in the morning you drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute and so the first thought that came to mind is everywhere we park we have electric power now it sounds crazy but in some places around the world like Scandinavia you already have that if you park your car and didn't plug in the heater when you come back you don't have a car it just doesn't work now that last mile last foot in a sense is the first step of the infrastructure the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension see we're bound by today's technology on batteries which is about a hundred and twenty miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and and wait limitations in a 120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people but you never want to get stuck and so what we added as a second element to our network which is a battery swap system you drive you take your depleted battery out a full battery comes on and you drive on and you don't do it as a human being you do it as a machine it looks like a car wash you come into your car wash and the plate comes up hold your battery takes it out and puts them back in and within two minutes you're back on the road and you can go again if you had charged spots everywhere and you had battery swap stations everywhere how often would you do it it ends up that you do swapping less times and you stop at a gas station as a matter of fact we add it to the contract we said that if you stopped to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience then we looked at the question of the affordability and we looked at the question what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car what is the cost of that battery everybody tells us batteries are so expensive and what we found out that when you move from molecules to electrons something interesting happens we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again the battery is not the gas stank in a sense remember in your car you have a gas tank you have the crude oil and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil is what we call petrol or gasoline the battery in this sense is the crude oil we have a battery bay it costs the same hundred dollar as the gas tank but the crude oil is replaced with a battery just it doesn't burn it consumes itself step after step it has 2000 life cycles these days and so it's sort of a mini well we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well for the life of the car nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car in a sense what we've done is we created a new consumable you today buy gasoline miles and we created electric miles and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number today 2010 in volume when we come to market it is eight cents a mile those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means in the average consumer environment we're in in the u.s. 20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50 a buck 60 a gallon that's cheaper than today's gasoline even in the u.s. in Europe where taxes are in place that's the equivalent to ace my nough $60 barrel but e miles follow Moore's law they go from 8 cents a mile in 2010 to 4 cents a mile in 2015 to 2 cents a mile by 2020 why because battery's life cycle improve a bit of improvement on energy density which reduces the price and these prices are actually with clean electron we do not use any electron that come from coal so in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 which is our desire imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road that is an 80 cent gallon 80 cent gala means if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil and we'll let any oil company bring it out and refine it they still can't compete with 2 cents a mile that's a new economic factor which is fascinating to most people now this would have been a wonderful paper so that's how I solved it in my head it was a white paper I handed out to governments and some governments told me that it's fascinating that the young generation actually thinks about these things until we got to the true young global leader Shimon Peres president of Israel and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me first he let me go to the prime minister of the country who told me if you can find the money you need for this network two hundred million dollars and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume in two million cars that's what we needed in Israel I'll give you a country to invest the 200 million into Paris thought that was a great idea so we went out and we we looked at all the car companies we send letters to all the car companies three of them never showed up one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they will give us a discount but one of them Carlos go and see over an O and Nissan when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating said hybrids are like mermaids when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish and gone came up and said I have the car mr. Paris I will build you the cars and he actually true to form Renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume mass volume being the first year a hundred thousand cars it's the first mass volume electric car zero emission electric car in the market I was running as Chris said to be the CEO of a large software company at called s AP and then Paris said well once you run this project and I said well I'm ready for CEO and he said no no no no no you got to explain to me what is more important than saving your country and saving the world that you would go and do and I had to quit and come do this thing called better place now we then decided to scale it up we went to other countries as I said we went to Denmark and Denmark said this beautiful policy it's called the IQ test it's inversely proportional to taxes they put a hundred and eighty percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero emission cars so if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark it cost you about sixty thousand euros if you buy our car it's about twenty thousand euro if you failed the IQ test they ask you to leave we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small island I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island but Israel is an island it's Transportation Island if your cars driving outside Israel it's been stolen and so if if you're thinking about it in terms of islands we decided to go to the biggest island we could find and that was Australia the third country we announced was Australia it's got three centres in Brisbane and Melbourne and Sydney and one freeway when electric free where they connect them the next Island was not too hard to find and that was Hawaii we decided to come into the US and pick the two best places the one where you didn't need any arranged extension Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery and if you really have a long day you can switch and keep on driving around the island and the second one was the San Francisco Bay Area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors he decided that he's going to take over the state unofficially and then officially and then created this beautiful region one policy and in San Francisco Bay and not only do you have the highest concentration of Priuses but you also have the perfect range extender it's called the other car now as we started scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the US why why is this a big issue and the most fascinating thing we've learned is that when you have small problems an individual level like the price of gasoline to drive every morning you don't notice it but when the aggregate comes up you're dead all right so the price of oil much like lots of other curves that we've seen goes along a depletion curve the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground and we'll keep getting wells that are further away from the ground he becomes more and more and more expensive to dig him out now you think well you know it's been up it's been down it's been up its gonna keep on going up and down here's the problem at 147 dollars a barrel which we were in six months ago the u.s. spent a ton of money to get oil then we lost our economy we went back down to 47 sometimes at 40 sometimes it's 50 now we're running a stimulus package it's called a trillion-dollar stimulus package we're gonna revive the economy hopefully it happens between now and 2015 somewhere in that space what happens when the economy recovers by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace were going at right now that's another 30 percent demand on oil that is another 25 million barrels a day that's all the u.s. usage today in other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak and then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as $200 a barrel we take our money and we give it away you know what happens at that point we go back down it's going to go up and down and the downs are gonna be much longer than the ups are gonna be much shorter and that's the difference between problems that are additive like co2 which we go slowly up and then we tip and problems that are depletive in which we lose what we have which oscillate in the oscillate until we lose everything we got now we actually looked at what the answer would be right remember in the campaign 1 million hybrid cars by 2015 that is 0.5% of the US oil consumption that is 0.0 well percent of the rest of the world that won't do much difference we looked at an MIT study 10 million electric cars on the global roads 10 million out of 500 million we will add between now and then that is the most pessimistic number you can have it's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from a hundred thousand cars in 2011 to 10 million cars by 2016 a hundred X growth in less than five years you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars we have 10 million cars by region that's an enormous amount of cars China is adding those cars India Russia Brazil we have all these region Europe has solved it they just put tax on gasoline they'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high China solves it by an edict at some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city and that will be it the Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on Range not a reduction in range we're the only ones who don't have the price set right don't have the industry set right don't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u.s. now whereas the car industry on that very interesting the car industry has been focused just on themselves they basically looked at it and said Carwin Auto will solve everything within the car itself no infrastructure no problem we forgot about the entire chain around us all this stuff that happens around we are looking at an emergence of a car to zero a whole new market a whole new business model a business model in which the money that is actually coming in to drive the car the minutes the miles if you want that you are all familiar with subsidized the price of the car just like cell phone you'll pay for the miles and some of it will go back to the car maker some of it will go back to your own pocket but our cars are actually gonna be cheaper than gasoline cars you're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills in Denmark we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills not from oil in Israel we've asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel and people said oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for we said what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years and I said what we tried there isn't any we said no no but what if we prove it and they say well you can dig and we decided to dig up instead of digging down these are perfect matches to one another now all you need is about 10% of the electricity generated think of it as a project that spans over about ten years that's 1% a year now when we're looking at solving big problems we need to start thinking in two numbers and those are not 20% by 2020 the two numbers are zero as in zero footprint or zero oil and scale at infinity and when we go to cop 15 at the end of this year we can't stop thinking at patting co2 we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale one car emits four tonnes and actually 700 and change million cars today I'm a at 2.8 billion tons of co2 that's in the additive about 25% of our problem cars and trucks add up to about 25% of the world's co2 emissions we have to come and attack this problem with a focus with an effort that actually says we're gonna go to zero before the world ends I actually share that with some legislators here in the US I shared it with with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr who's one of my idols and I told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remember it is because he said we're gonna send a man to the moon and we'll do it by the end of the decade we didn't say we're gonna send a man 20% to the moon and they'll be about 20% chance we'll recover him he actually shared with me another story which is from about 200 years ago 200 years ago in Parliament in Great Britain there was a long argument over economy versus morality 25 percent just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars 25 percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in in the UK came from a source of energy that was immoral human slaves and there was an argument should we stop using slaves and what would it do to our economy and people say what we need to take time to do it let's not do it immediately maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves and after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery and the Industrial Revolution started within less than one year in the UK had a hundred years of economic growth we have to make the right moral decision we have to make it immediately we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in Israel that said we were Ndoye 'el and we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years but within this presidential term because if we don't we will lose our economy right after we lost our morality thank you all very much you

mile in 2015 to 2 cents a mile by 2020 why because battery's life cycle improve a bit of improvement on energy density which reduces the price and these prices are actually with clean electron we do not use any electron that come from coal so in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 which is our desire imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road that is an 80 cent gallon 80 cent gala means if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil and we'll let any oil company bring it out and refine it they still can't compete with 2 cents a mile that's a new economic factor which is fascinating to most people now this would have been a wonderful paper so that's how I solved it in my head it was a white paper I handed out to governments and some governments told me that it's fascinating that the young generation actually thinks about these things until we got to the true young global leader Shimon Peres president of Israel and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me first he let me go to the prime minister of the country who told me if you can find the money you need for this network two hundred million dollars and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume in two million cars that's what we needed in Israel I'll give you a country to invest the 200 million into Paris thought that was a great idea so we went out and we we looked at all the car companies we send letters to all the car companies three of them never showed up one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they will give us a discount but one of them Carlos go and see over an O and Nissan when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating said hybrids are like mermaids when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish and gone came up and said I have the car mr. Paris I will build you the cars and he actually true to form Renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume mass volume being the first year a hundred thousand cars it's the first mass volume electric car zero emission electric car in the market I was running as Chris said to be the CEO of a large software company at called s AP and then Paris said well once you run this project and I said well I'm ready for CEO and he said no no no no no you got to explain to me what is more important than saving your country and saving the world that you would go and do and I had to quit and come do this thing called better place now we then decided to scale it up we went to other countries as I said we went to Denmark and Denmark said this beautiful policy it's called the IQ test it's inversely proportional to taxes they put a hundred and eighty percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero emission cars so if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark it cost you about sixty thousand euros if you buy our car it's about twenty thousand euro if you failed the IQ test they ask you to leave we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small island I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island but Israel is an island it's Transportation Island if your cars driving outside Israel it's been stolen and so if if you're thinking about it in terms of islands we decided to go to the biggest island we could find and that was Australia the third country we announced was Australia it's got three centres in Brisbane and Melbourne and Sydney and one freeway when electric free where they connect them the next Island was not too hard to find and that was Hawaii we decided to come into the US and pick the two best places the one where you didn't need any arranged extension Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery and if you really have a long day you can switch and keep on driving around the island and the second one was the San Francisco Bay Area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors he decided that he's going to take over the state unofficially and then officially and then created this beautiful region one policy and in San Francisco Bay and not only do you have the highest concentration of Priuses but you also have the perfect range extender it's called the other car now as we started scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the US why why is this a big issue and the most fascinating thing we've learned is that when you have small problems an individual level like the price of gasoline to drive every morning you don't notice it but when the aggregate comes up you're dead all right so the price of oil much like lots of other curves that we've seen goes along a depletion curve the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground and we'll keep getting wells that are further away from the ground he becomes more and more and more expensive to dig him out now you think well you know it's been up it's been down it's been up its gonna keep on going up and down here's the problem at 147 dollars a barrel which we were in six months ago the u.s. spent a ton of money to get oil then we lost our economy we went back down to 47 sometimes at 40 sometimes it's 50 now we're running a stimulus package it's called a trillion-dollar stimulus package we're gonna revive the economy hopefully it happens between now and 2015 somewhere in that space what happens when the economy recovers by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace were going at right now that's another 30 percent demand on oil that is another 25 million barrels a day that's all the u.s. usage today in other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak and then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as $200 a barrel we take our money and we give it away you know what happens at that point we go back down it's going to go up and down and the downs are gonna be much longer than the ups are gonna be much shorter and that's the difference between problems that are additive like co2 which we go slowly up and then we tip and problems that are depletive in which we lose what we have which oscillate in the oscillate until we lose everything we got now we actually looked at what the answer would be right remember in the campaign 1 million hybrid cars by 2015 that is 0.5% of the US oil consumption that is 0.0 well percent of the rest of the world that won't do much difference we looked at an MIT study 10 million electric cars on the global roads 10 million out of 500 million we will add between now and then that is the most pessimistic number you can have it's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from a hundred thousand cars in 2011 to 10 million cars by 2016 a hundred X growth in less than five years you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars we have 10 million cars by region that's an enormous amount of cars China is adding those cars India Russia Brazil we have all these region Europe has solved it they just put tax on gasoline they'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high China solves it by an edict at some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city and that will be it the Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on Range not a reduction in range we're the only ones who don't have the price set right don't have the industry set right don't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u.s. now whereas the car industry on that very interesting the car industry has been focused just on themselves they basically looked at it and said Carwin Auto will solve everything within the car itself no infrastructure no problem we forgot about the entire chain around us all this stuff that happens around we are looking at an emergence of a car to zero a whole new market a whole new business model a business model in which the money that is actually coming in to drive the car the minutes the miles if you want that you are all familiar with subsidized the price of the car just like cell phone you'll pay for the miles and some of it will go back to the car maker some of it will go back to your own pocket but our cars are actually gonna be cheaper than gasoline cars you're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills in Denmark we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills not from oil in Israel we've asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel and people said oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for we said what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years and I said what we tried there isn't any we said no no but what if we prove it and they say well you can dig and we decided to dig up instead of digging down these are perfect matches to one another now all you need is about 10% of the electricity generated think of it as a project that spans over about ten years that's 1% a year now when we're looking at solving big problems we need to start thinking in two numbers and those are not 20% by 2020 the two numbers are zero as in zero footprint or zero oil and scale at infinity and when we go to cop 15 at the end of this year we can't stop thinking at patting co2 we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale one car emits four tonnes and actually 700 and change million cars today I'm a at 2.8 billion tons of co2 that's in the additive about 25% of our problem cars and trucks add up to about 25% of the world's co2 emissions we have to come and attack this problem with a focus with an effort that actually says we're gonna go to zero before the world ends I actually share that with some legislators here in the US I shared it with with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr who's one of my idols and I told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remember it is because he said we're gonna send a man to the moon and we'll do it by the end of the decade we didn't say we're gonna send a man 20% to the moon and they'll be about 20% chance we'll recover him he actually shared with me another story which is from about 200 years ago 200 years ago in Parliament in Great Britain there was a long argument over economy versus morality 25 percent just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars 25 percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in in the UK came from a source of energy that was immoral human slaves and there was an argument should we stop using slaves and what would it do to our economy and people say what we need to take time to do it let's not do it immediately maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves and after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery and the Industrial Revolution started within less than one year in the UK had a hundred years of economic growth we have to make the right moral decision we have to make it immediately we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in Israel that said we were Ndoye 'el and we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years but within this presidential term because if we don't we will lose our economy right after we lost our morality thank you all very much you

**Transcript**:
so how would you run a whole country without oil that's the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago and it never left my brain and I started playing with it more like puzzle the original thought I had this must be ethanol so I went out and researched ethanol and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country about six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen until some scientists told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car if you use hydrogen so that's not going to be the path to go and then sort of through a process of wandering around I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars in a way that is convenient and affordable you could get to a solution now I started this from a point of view that it's it has to be something that scales a mass not how do you build one car but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99% of the population the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today so one it has to be more convenient than a car and two has to be more affordable than today's cars and affordable is not a $40,000 sedan right that's not something we can finance or buy today inconvenient is not something you drive for an hour and charge Freight so we're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics and so the thought that that I started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up how do you do it within economics that we have today how do you do it from the power of the consumer up and not from the power of an edict down in on a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic batteries not included now if you separate between the two you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network by creating a network before the cars show up and the network has two components in them first component is you charge the car whenever you stop ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours in park for about 22 hours and if you drive a car in the morning you drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute and so the first thought that came to mind is everywhere we park we have electric power now it sounds crazy but in some places around the world like Scandinavia you already have that if you park your car and didn't plug in the heater when you come back you don't have a car it just doesn't work now that last mile last foot in a sense is the first step of the infrastructure the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension see we're bound by today's technology on batteries which is about a hundred and twenty miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and and wait limitations in a 120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people but you never want to get stuck and so what we added as a second element to our network which is a battery swap system you drive you take your depleted battery out a full battery comes on and you drive on and you don't do it as a human being you do it as a machine it looks like a car wash you come into your car wash and the plate comes up hold your battery takes it out and puts them back in and within two minutes you're back on the road and you can go again if you had charged spots everywhere and you had battery swap stations everywhere how often would you do it it ends up that you do swapping less times and you stop at a gas station as a matter of fact we add it to the contract we said that if you stopped to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience then we looked at the question of the affordability and we looked at the question what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car what is the cost of that battery everybody tells us batteries are so expensive and what we found out that when you move from molecules to electrons something interesting happens we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again the battery is not the gas stank in a sense remember in your car you have a gas tank you have the crude oil and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil is what we call petrol or gasoline the battery in this sense is the crude oil we have a battery bay it costs the same hundred dollar as the gas tank but the crude oil is replaced with a battery just it doesn't burn it consumes itself step after step it has 2000 life cycles these days and so it's sort of a mini well we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well for the life of the car nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car in a sense what we've done is we created a new consumable you today buy gasoline miles and we created electric miles and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number today 2010 in volume when we come to market it is eight cents a mile those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means in the average consumer environment we're in in the u.s. 20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50 a buck 60 a gallon that's cheaper than today's gasoline even in the u.s. in Europe where taxes are in place that's the equivalent to ace my nough $60 barrel but e miles follow Moore's law they go from 8 cents a mile in 2010 to 4 cents a mile in 2015 to 2 cents a mile by 2020 why because battery's life cycle improve a bit of improvement on energy density which reduces the price and these prices are actually with clean electron we do not use any electron that come from coal so in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 which is our desire imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road that is an 80 cent gallon 80 cent gala means if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil and we'll let any oil company bring it out and refine it they still can't compete with 2 cents a mile that's a new economic factor which is fascinating to most people now this would have been a wonderful paper so that's

you need for this network two hundred million dollars and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume in two million cars that's what we needed in Israel I'll give you a country to invest the 200 million into Paris thought that was a great idea so we went out and we we looked at all the car companies we send letters to all the car companies three of them never showed

leadership just like we had in Israel that said we were Ndoye 'el and we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years but within this presidential term because if we don't we will lose our economy right after we lost our morality thank you all very much you

**Transcript**:
so how would you run a whole country without oil that's the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago and it never left my brain and I started playing with it more like puzzle the original thought I had this must be ethanol so I went out and researched ethanol and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country about six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen until some scientists told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car if you use hydrogen so that's not going to be the path to go and then sort of through a process of wandering around I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars in a way that is convenient and affordable you could get to a solution now I started this from a point of view that it's it has to be something that scales a mass not how do you build one car but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99% of the population the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today so one it has to be more convenient than a car and two has to be more affordable than today's cars and affordable is not a $40,000 sedan right that's not something we can finance or buy today inconvenient is not something you drive for an hour and charge Freight so we're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics and so the thought that that I started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up how do you do it within economics that we have today how do you do it from the power of the consumer up and not from the power of an edict down in on a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic batteries not included now if you separate between the two you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network by creating a network before the cars show up and the network has two components in them first component is you charge the car whenever you stop ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours in park for about 22 hours and if you drive a car in the morning you drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute and so the first thought that came to mind is everywhere we park we have electric power now it sounds crazy but in some places around the world like Scandinavia you already have that if you park your car and didn't plug in the heater when you come back you don't have a car it just doesn't work now that last mile last foot in a sense is the first step of the infrastructure the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension see we're bound by today's technology on batteries which is about a hundred and twenty miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and and wait limitations in a 120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people but you never want to get stuck and so what we added as a second element to our network which is a battery swap system you drive you take your depleted battery out a full battery comes on and you drive on and you don't do it as a human being you do it as a machine it looks like a car wash you come into your car wash and the plate comes up hold your battery takes it out and puts them back in and within two minutes you're back on the road and you can go again if you had charged spots everywhere and you had battery swap stations everywhere how often would you do it it ends up that you do swapping less times and you stop at a gas station as a matter of fact we add it to the contract we said that if you stopped to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience then we looked at the question of the affordability and we looked at the question what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car what is the cost of that battery everybody tells us batteries are so expensive and what we found out that when you move from molecules to electrons something interesting happens we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again the battery is not the gas stank in a sense remember in your car you have a gas tank you have the crude oil and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil is what we call petrol or gasoline the battery in this sense is the crude oil we have a battery bay it costs the same hundred dollar as the gas tank but the crude oil is replaced with a battery just it doesn't burn it consumes itself step after step it has 2000 life cycles these days and so it's sort of a mini well we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well for the life of the car nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car in a sense what we've done is we created a new consumable you today buy gasoline miles and we created electric miles and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number today 2010 in volume when we come to market it is eight cents a mile those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means in the average consumer environment we're in in the u.s. 20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50 a buck 60 a gallon that's cheaper than today's gasoline even in the u.s. in Europe where taxes are in place that's the equivalent to ace my nough $60 barrel but e miles follow Moore's law they go from 8 cents a mile in 2010 to 4 cents a mile in 2015 to 2 cents a mile by 2020 why because battery's life cycle improve a bit of improvement on energy density which reduces the price and these prices are actually with clean electron we do not use any electron that come from coal so in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 which is our desire imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road that is an 80 cent gallon 80 cent gala means if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil and we'll let any oil company bring it out and refine it they still can't compete with 2 cents a mile that's a new economic factor which is fascinating to most people now this would have been a wonderful paper so that's how I solved it in my head it was a white paper I handed out to governments and some governments told me that it's fascinating that the young generation actually thinks about these things until we got to the true young global leader Shimon Peres president of Israel and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me first he let me go to the prime minister of the country who told me if you can find the money you need for this network two hundred million dollars and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume in two million cars that's what we needed in Israel I'll give you a country to invest the 200 million into Paris thought that was a great idea so we went out and we we looked at all the car companies we send letters to all the car companies three of them never showed up one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they will give us a discount but one of them Carlos go and see over an O and Nissan when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating said hybrids are like mermaids when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish and gone came up and said I have the car mr. Paris I will build you the cars and he actually true to form Renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume mass volume being the first year a hundred thousand cars it's the first mass volume electric car zero emission electric car in the market I was running as Chris said to be the CEO of a large software company at called s AP and then Paris said well once you run this project and I said well I'm ready for CEO and he said no no no no no you got to explain to me what is more important than saving your country and saving the world that you would go and do and I had to quit and come do this thing called better place now we then decided to scale it up we went to other countries as I said we went to Denmark and Denmark said this beautiful policy it's called the IQ test it's inversely proportional to taxes they put a hundred and eighty percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero emission cars so if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark it cost you about sixty thousand euros if you buy our car it's about twenty thousand euro if you failed the IQ test they ask you to leave we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small island I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island but Israel is an island it's Transportation Island if your cars driving outside Israel it's been stolen and so if if you're thinking about it in terms of islands we decided to go to the biggest island we could find and that was Australia the third country we announced was Australia it's got three centres in Brisbane and Melbourne and Sydney and one freeway when electric free where they connect them the next Island was not too hard to find and that was Hawaii we decided to come into the US and pick the two best places the one where you didn't need any arranged extension Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery and if you really have a long day you can switch and keep on driving around the island and the second one was the San Francisco Bay Area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors he decided that he's going to take over the state unofficially and then officially and then created this beautiful region one policy and in San Francisco Bay and not only do you have the highest concentration of Priuses but you also have the perfect range extender it's called the other car now as we started scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the US why why is this a big issue and the most fascinating thing we've learned is that when you have small problems an individual level like the price of gasoline to drive every morning you don't notice it but when the aggregate comes up you're dead all right so the price of oil much like lots of other curves that we've seen goes along a depletion curve the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground and we'll keep getting wells that are further away from the ground he becomes more and more and more expensive to dig him out now you think well you know it's been up it's been down it's been up its gonna keep on going up and down here's the problem at 147 dollars a barrel which we were in six months ago the u.s. spent a ton of money to get oil then we lost our economy we went back down to 47 sometimes at 40 sometimes it's 50 now we're running a stimulus package it's called a trillion-dollar stimulus package we're gonna revive the economy hopefully it happens between now and 2015 somewhere in that space what happens when the economy recovers by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace were going at right now that's another 30 percent demand on oil that is another 25 million barrels a day that's all the u.s. usage today in other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak and then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as $200 a barrel we take our money and we give it away you know what happens at that point we go back down it's going to go up and down and the downs are gonna be much longer than the ups are gonna be much shorter and that's the difference between problems that are additive like co2 which we go slowly up and then we tip and problems that are depletive in which we lose what we have which oscillate in the oscillate until we lose everything we got now we actually looked at what the answer would be right remember in the campaign 1 million hybrid cars by 2015 that is 0.5% of the US oil consumption that is 0.0 well percent of the rest of the world that won't do much difference we looked at an MIT study 10 million electric cars on the global roads 10 million out of 500 million we will add between now and then that is the most pessimistic number you can have it's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from a hundred thousand cars in 2011 to 10 million cars by 2016 a hundred X growth in less than five years you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars we have 10 million cars by region that's an enormous amount of cars China is adding those cars India Russia Brazil we have all these region Europe has solved it they just put tax on gasoline they'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high China solves it by an edict at some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city and that will be it the Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on Range not a reduction in range we're the only ones who don't have the price set right don't have the industry set right don't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u.s. now whereas the car industry on that very interesting the car industry has been focused just on themselves they basically looked at it and said Carwin Auto will solve everything within the car itself no infrastructure no problem we forgot about the entire chain around us all this stuff that happens around we are looking at an emergence of a car to zero a whole new market a whole new business model a business model in which the money that is actually coming in to drive the car the minutes the miles if you want that you are all familiar with subsidized the price of the car just like cell phone you'll pay for the miles and some of it will go back to the car maker some of it will go back to your own pocket but our cars are actually gonna be cheaper than gasoline cars you're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills in Denmark we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills not from oil in Israel we've asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel and people said oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for we said what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years and I said what we tried there isn't any we said no no but what if we prove it and they say well you can dig and we decided to dig up instead of digging down these are perfect matches to one another now all you need is about 10% of the electricity generated think of it as a project that spans over about ten years that's 1% a year now when we're looking at solving big problems we need to start thinking in two numbers and those are not 20% by 2020 the two numbers are zero as in zero footprint or zero oil and scale at infinity and when we go to cop 15 at the end of this year we can't stop thinking at patting co2 we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale one car emits four tonnes and actually 700 and change million cars today I'm a at 2.8 billion tons of co2 that's in the additive about 25% of our problem cars and trucks add up to about 25% of the world's co2 emissions we have to come and attack this problem with a focus with an effort that actually says we're gonna go to zero before the world ends I actually share that with some legislators here in the US I shared it with with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr who's one of my idols and I told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remember it is because he said we're gonna send a man to the moon and we'll do it by the end of the decade we didn't say we're gonna send a man 20% to the moon and they'll be about 20% chance we'll recover him he actually shared with me another story which is from about 200 years ago 200 years ago in Parliament in Great Britain there was a long argument over economy versus morality 25 percent just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars 25 percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in in the UK came from a source of energy that was immoral human slaves and there was an argument should we stop using slaves and what would it do to our economy and people say what we need to take time to do it let's not do it immediately maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves and after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery and the Industrial Revolution started within less than one year in the UK had a hundred years of economic growth we have to make the right moral decision we have to make it immediately we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in Israel that said we were Ndoye 'el and we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years but within this presidential term because if we don't we will lose our economy right after we lost our morality thank you all very much you

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Let me guess, you've got Facebook albums full of photos. You have photos on your computer desktop, on your mobile phone, on your bedroom wall. You see photos in magazines and newspapers, on the side of buses, and of course, in your family albums. We take photos for granted in a major way. But, creating a picture that looked exactly like the person or thing that you were photographing wasn't always obvious. In fact, in the past, it was a big mystery. How could you, in essence, take your reflection in the mirror and freeze it in there? In the 9th century, the Arab scientist Alhazen had come up with the idea of using the camera obscura, which was literally a dark room, or box, with a single, small hole in one side that let light through. This would project the image outside into the wall inside. During the Renaissance, artists like Leonardo DaVinci used this method to introduce 3-D scenes onto a flat plane so that they could copy things, like perspective, more easily. In 1724, Johann Heinrich Schultz discovered that exposing certain silver compounds to light altered their appearance and left marks wherever the light touched. Essentially, Schultz found a way to record the images that Alhazen was able to project, but only for a little while. Schultz's images disappeared soon after he had made them. It wasn't until 1839 that people figured out how to project images onto light-sensitive surfaces that would retain the image after exposure, and thus, photography was born. At that point, it was mostly two inventors who fought for the best way to make photos. One was British scientist Henry Fox Talbot, whose calotype process used paper and allowed many copies to be made from a single negative. The other inventor, Louis Daguerre, was an artist and chemist in France. He developed something called a daguerreotype, which used a silvered plate and which produced a sharper image. But the daguerreotype could only make positive images so copies had to be made by taking another photo. In the end, the daguerreotype won out as the first commercially successful photographic process mostly because the government made it freely available to the public. So now that photography was available, getting a picture of yourself would be a snap, right? Well, not exactly! This process still required a whole dark room at the location of the photograph, which was a big hassle. Picture the early photographers lugging enormous trailers with all their equipment wherever they wanted to take a picture. Not only that, but the early processes had extremely long exposure times. To get a good photo, you would have to stand perfectly still for up to two minutes! This led to development of inventions like the head holder, a wire frame that would hide behind you while supporting your head. It's also why you don't see people smiling in early photographs. It's not that life was that bad, it was just hard to keep a steady grin for more than a few seconds, so people opted for a straight-faced look. And then George Eastman came along. Eastman believed that everyone should have access to photography, and he spent many late nights mixing chemicals in his mother's kitchen to try to achieve a dry plate photographic process. This would allow exposed negatives to be stored and developed later at a more convenient place instead of carting those dark rooms, necessary for wet plates, around. After starting a business, which initially made dry plates, Eastman eventually discovered plastic roll film that would fit in hand-held, inexpensive cameras. These cameras sold by the millions under the tag line, "You push the button, we do the rest." While Eastman was largely responsible for making photography a universal pastime, even he could not have dreamed of the ways photography had since shaped the world. It's now estimated that over 380 billion photographs are taken each year. That's more photographs each day than were taken in the first hundred years after photography was invented. Say cheese!

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Let me guess, you've got Facebook albums full of photos. You have photos on your computer desktop, on your mobile phone, on your bedroom wall. You see photos in magazines and newspapers, on the side of buses, and of course, in your family albums. We take photos for granted in a major way. But, creating a picture that looked exactly like the person or thing that you were photographing wasn't always obvious. In fact, in the past, it was a big mystery. How could you, in essence, take your reflection in the mirror and freeze it in there? In the 9th century, the Arab scientist Alhazen had come up with the idea of using the camera obscura, which was literally a dark room, or box, with a single, small hole in one side that let light through. This would project the image outside into the wall inside. During the Renaissance, artists like Leonardo DaVinci used this method to introduce 3-D scenes onto a flat plane so that they could copy things, like perspective, more easily. In 1724, Johann Heinrich Schultz discovered that exposing certain silver compounds to light altered their appearance and left marks wherever the light touched. Essentially, Schultz found a way to record the images that Alhazen was able to project, but only for a little while. Schultz's images disappeared soon after he had made them. It wasn't until 1839 that people figured out how to project images onto light-sensitive surfaces that would retain the image after exposure, and thus, photography was born. At that point, it was mostly two inventors who fought for the best way to make photos. One was British scientist Henry Fox Talbot, whose calotype process used paper and allowed many copies to be made from a single negative. The other inventor, Louis Daguerre, was an artist and chemist in France. He developed something called a daguerreotype, which used a silvered plate and which produced a sharper image. But the daguerreotype could only make positive images so copies had to be made by taking another photo. In the end, the daguerreotype won out as the first commercially successful photographic process mostly because the government made it freely available to the public. So now that photography was available, getting a picture of yourself would be a snap, right? Well, not exactly! This process still required a whole dark room at the location of the photograph, which was a big hassle. Picture the early photographers lugging enormous trailers with all their equipment wherever they wanted to take a picture. Not only that, but the early processes had extremely long exposure times. To get a good photo, you would have to stand perfectly still for up to two minutes! This led to development of inventions like the head holder, a wire frame that would hide behind you while supporting your head. It's also why you don't see people smiling in early photographs. It's not that life was that bad, it was just hard to keep a steady grin for more than a few seconds, so people opted for a straight-faced look. And then George Eastman came along. Eastman believed that everyone should have access to photography, and he spent many late nights mixing chemicals in his mother's kitchen to try to achieve a dry plate photographic process. This would allow exposed negatives to be stored and developed later at a more convenient place instead of carting those dark rooms, necessary for wet plates, around. After starting a business, which initially made dry plates, Eastman eventually discovered plastic roll film that would fit in hand-held, inexpensive cameras. These cameras sold by the millions under the tag line, "You push the button, we do the rest." While Eastman was largely responsible for making photography a universal pastime, even he could not have dreamed of the ways photography had since shaped the world. It's now estimated that over 380 billion photographs are taken each year. That's more photographs each day than were taken in the first hundred years after photography was invented. Say cheese!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4, but it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 4 does mention one of the inventors (Louis Daguerre) from the same time period as Johann Heinrich Schultz.

A more similar question would be one that asks about Johann Heinrich Schultz's discovery. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content and the time period mentioned in the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 2, but it's about a different person (Alhazen).

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content (i.e., a scientist making a discovery), I would choose Question 7, but it's about a different person (George Eastman) and a different discovery.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is most similar in terms of the time period and the type of discovery mentioned.

But a membrane made of fishnet stocking would go too far in the opposite direction - leaky, but easily torn. So, the ideal membrane falls somewhere in the middle. Over the past few centuries, we've learned a lot about the way membranes work. The tale starts in the late 1800's when, according to legend, a German woman named Agnes Pockels was doing dishes. Her observation, that not all detergents dissolve grease in the same way, piqued her curiosity, so she made careful measurements of the size of soapy films that formed on the surface of a metal tray filled with water. Later, in the 1920's, GE scientists Irving Langmuir and Katharine Blodgett reexamined the problem with a more elaborate contraption and found that those tiny slicks were in fact a single layer of oil molecules. Each oil molecule has one side that loves water and floats on the surface, and one side that loathes water and protrudes into the air. So what does it have to do with cell membranes? Well, at the turn of the 20th century, chemists Charles Overton and Hans Meyer demonstrated that the cell membrane is composed of substances that, like oil, have a water-loving part and a water-loathing part. We now call these substances lipids. In 1925, two scientists, Evert Gorter and Francois Grendel, pushed our understanding further. They designed an experiment meant to test whether cell membranes are made of only one layer of lipids, a monolayer, or two layers stacked on top of one another, called a bilayer. Gorter and Grendel drew blood from a dog, a sheep, a rabbit, a goat, a guinea pig, and human volunteers. From each of these samples, they extracted all the lipids from all the red blood cells and placed a few drops of this extract on a tray of water. True to form, the lipids, like oil, spread out into a monolayer, whose size Gorter and Grendel could measure. If they compared the surface area of that monolayer to the surface area to the intact red blood cells, they'd be able to tell whether the red blood cell membrane is one or two layers thick. To understand the design of their experiment, imagine looking down at a sandwich. If you measure the surface area of what you see, you'll get the dimensions of a single slice of bread even though there are two slices, one stacked perfectly atop the other. But, if you open the sandwich and place the two slices side by side, you get twice the surface area. The Gorter and Grendel experiment is basically the same idea. The open sandwich is the monolayer formed by extracted cellular lipids spreading out into a sheet. The closed sandwich is the intact red blood cell membrane. Low and behold, they observed a two-to-one ratio, proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that a cell membrane is a bilayer, which when unstacked, yields a monolayer twice its size. So almost 30 years before the double-helix structure of DNA was elucidated, a single experiment involving fancy versions of household materials enabled deep insight into the basic architecture of the cell.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the outermost layer of a cell, and the correct answer is "cell membrane." Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 is somewhat related, as it asks about the structure of the cell membrane. However, it does not ask about the outermost layer of a cell.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 8, but with a note that it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index.

Instead, I suggest creating a new generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ, such as:

Question: What is the outermost layer of a cell that separates it from the cells around it?
Options: A. Cell bilayer, B. Mitochondria, C. Cell membrane, D. Pseudostratified epithelial

Question 1 is asking about the primary function of a cell membrane, and while it does not directly address the construction of the cell membrane, it does provide some insight into its properties. The correct answer is not provided, but based on the transcript, we know that the cell membrane needs to be both sturdy and flexible to regulate the movement of molecules in and out of the cell.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 1.

However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQs do not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new MCQ should be generated to better match the ground truth MCQ. A possible new MCQ could be:

Question: What is the correct description of a cell membrane's construction?
Options: A. Strong and sturdy like a metal jacket, B. Flexible and dynamic like a soap film, C. Both sturdy and flexible, D. None of the above
Correct Option: C

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Blue whales are the largest animals
that have ever roamed the planet. They’re at least two times 
as big as the biggest dinosaurs— “that’s big!“— the length of a basketball court, and as heavy as 40 African elephants. If that’s not enough to make you marvel,
here’s something that will. They’ve grown to this enormous size by feeding exclusively on tiny shrimp-like
creatures called krill— that are no bigger 
than your little finger. In many ways, the sheer size of krill seems to have driven 
the evolution of the blue whale. See, krill are so small
but are found in dense patches. For increased efficiency, blue whales have evolved to use 
a feeding strategy called lunge feeding. Basically, 
the whale accelerates towards a prey patch and opens its mouth wide. To increase the capacity, 
its mouth expands. The special, accordion-like 
blubber layer that extends from its snout 
to its belly button enables the whale to engulf 
large quantities of prey-laden water. With each giant gulp, the whale takes in 125% of its body weight
in water and krill. The whale must then expel the water
while retaining the yummy krill. To do this, it uses its baleen, the comb-like structure made of the same 
stuff our nails and hair are made of, and its tongue. It’s pretty crazy that the blue whale’s 
heart is as big as a small car, a child could crawl through its arteries, its tongue weighs as much as an elephant, but its esophagus is so small, the whale could choke on a loaf of bread. These whales are really not designed 
to feed on anything larger than krill. It’s estimated that blue whales eat 
four tons of krill per day. Because of their incredible design, each dive provides the blue whale 
with 90 times as much energy as is used. Every mouthful of krill provides 
almost 480,000 calories, the same amount you get 
from eating 1,900 hamburgers. But, why are blue whales so big? Blue whales are considerably larger
than the largest living land animal, the elephant. The heavier an animal is, the greater its relative surface area. As weight increases, there’s a point at which the legs 
of that animal would simply collapse. That explains why elephants don’t stand 
on the delicate legs of a horse. They need legs shaped like stout pedestals to hold their bodies up against gravity. In water, the situation 
is quite different. Buoyancy counteracts 
the gravitational pull on the body and their great bulk is therefore 
partially supported by the water. So, the ocean is a great place for species
that want to grow bigger. The other secret to their size
is their diet. By evolving such a huge mouth, the whale’s have specialized to catch 
enormous quantities of highly abundant and nutritious prey, which provides the energy needed 
to grow so big. But, now maybe you’re wondering
why blue whales aren’t any bigger? After all, the ocean sounds like nirvana
for any growing beast. Well, while lunge feeding may 
have allowed blue whales to become the biggest animal 
to have ever roamed the planet, by enabling them to feed efficiently 
in dense prey patches, it isn't cost free. Scientists compared all the costs 
involved with lunge feeding to the energy gained 
from the krill they eat. What they found is that when the whale’s 
body increases in size, the energy that body demands rises faster than the extra energy they get 
from their food. Feeding whales needs 15 times the energy 
required to remain still and 5 times more energy 
than used when swimming. Calculations show that the largest 
a lunge feeder can grow is 33 meters, pretty much blue whale size. Turns out blue whales have a lot
to thank krill for: neat, evolutionary adaptations that would 
not have been possible if krill were not so small. It’s incredible that these tiny creatures 
have allowed blue whales to really push the limits 
of size on our planet. Makes you wonder if that old adage, 
“you are what you eat,” really does apply in blue whale world.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content.

The ground truth MCQ is about comparing the size of blue whales to the biggest dinosaurs. While none of the generated MCQs directly address this comparison, Question 8 is related to the size of blue whales, although it focuses on the reason for their size rather than a comparison to dinosaurs.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 8. However, please note that this is not a direct match.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Blue whales are the largest animals
that have ever roamed the planet. They’re at least two times 
as big as the biggest dinosaurs— “that’s big!“— the length of a basketball court, and as heavy as 40 African elephants. If that’s not enough to make you marvel,
here’s something that will. They’ve grown to this enormous size by feeding exclusively on tiny shrimp-like
creatures called krill— that are no bigger 
than your little finger. In many ways, the sheer size of krill seems to have driven 
the evolution of the blue whale. See, krill are so small
but are found in dense patches. For increased efficiency, blue whales have evolved to use 
a feeding strategy called lunge feeding. Basically, 
the whale accelerates towards a prey patch and opens its mouth wide. To increase the capacity, 
its mouth expands. The special, accordion-like 
blubber layer that extends from its snout 
to its belly button enables the whale to engulf 
large quantities of prey-laden water. With each giant gulp, the whale takes in 125% of its body weight
in water and krill. The whale must then expel the water
while retaining the yummy krill. To do this, it uses its baleen, the comb-like structure made of the same 
stuff our nails and hair are made of, and its tongue. It’s pretty crazy that the blue whale’s 
heart is as big as a small car, a child could crawl through its arteries, its tongue weighs as much as an elephant, but its esophagus is so small, the whale could choke on a loaf of bread. These whales are really not designed 
to feed on anything larger than krill. It’s estimated that blue whales eat 
four tons of krill per day. Because of their incredible design, each dive provides the blue whale 
with 90 times as much energy as is used. Every mouthful of krill provides 
almost 480,000 calories, the same amount you get 
from eating 1,900 hamburgers. But, why are blue whales so big? Blue whales are considerably larger
than the largest living land animal, the elephant. The heavier an animal is, the greater its relative surface area. As weight increases, there’s a point at which the legs 
of that animal would simply collapse. That explains why elephants don’t stand 
on the delicate legs of a horse. They need legs shaped like stout pedestals to hold their bodies up against gravity. In water, the situation 
is quite different. Buoyancy counteracts 
the gravitational pull on the body and their great bulk is therefore 
partially supported by the water. So, the ocean is a great place for species
that want to grow bigger. The other secret to their size
is their diet. By evolving such a huge mouth, the whale’s have specialized to catch 
enormous quantities of highly abundant and nutritious prey, which provides the energy needed 
to grow so big. But, now maybe you’re wondering
why blue whales aren’t any bigger? After all, the ocean sounds like nirvana
for any growing beast. Well, while lunge feeding may 
have allowed blue whales to become the biggest animal 
to have ever roamed the planet, by enabling them to feed efficiently 
in dense prey patches, it isn't cost free. Scientists compared all the costs 
involved with lunge feeding to the energy gained 
from the krill they eat. What they found is that when the whale’s 
body increases in size, the energy that body demands rises faster than the extra energy they get 
from their food. Feeding whales needs 15 times the energy 
required to remain still and 5 times more energy 
than used when swimming. Calculations show that the largest 
a lunge feeder can grow is 33 meters, pretty much blue whale size. Turns out blue whales have a lot
to thank krill for: neat, evolutionary adaptations that would 
not have been possible if krill were not so small. It’s incredible that these tiny creatures 
have allowed blue whales to really push the limits 
of size on our planet. Makes you wonder if that old adage, 
“you are what you eat,” really does apply in blue whale world.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Music] the brilliant playright audrianne Kennedy wrote a volume called people who have led my plays and if I were to write a volume it would be called artists who have led my exhibitions because my work in understanding art and in understanding culture has come by following artists by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are JJ from Good Times significant to many people of course because of Dino might but perhaps more significant as the first really black artist on prime time TV Jean Michelle basat important to me because the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what I was about to enter into my overall project is about art specifically about black artists very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves my interest is an artists who understand and rewrite history who think about themselves within The Narrative of the larger world of art but who have created new places for us to see and understand I'm showing two artists here Glenn Ligon and Carol Walker two of many who really form for me the essential questions that I wanted to bring as a curator to the world I was interested in the idea of why and how I could create create a new story a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world and to do this I knew that I had to see the way in which artists work understand the artist studio as a laboratory imagine then Reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper asking questions providing the space to look and to think about answers in 1994 when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum I made an exhibition called blackmail it looked at the intersection of race and gender in Contemporary American art it sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for a dialogue complicated dialogue dialogue with many many points of entry and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas this exhibition included over 20 artists of various ages and races but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view what was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator as a catalyst for this dialogue one of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people's understanding of themselves and each other I'm showing you two works one on the right by Leon golb one on the left by Robert kscott and in the course of the exhibition which was contentious controversial and ultimately for me life-changing in my sense of what art could be a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other and she pointed to the work on the Left To Tell me how problematic this image was as it related for her to the idea of how black people had been represented and she pointed to the image on the right as an example to me of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media she then assigned these Works racial identities basically saying to me that the work on the right clearly was made by a black artists the work on the left clearly by a white artist went in effect that was the opposite case Bob kott African-American artist Leon golb uh a a white artist the point of that for me was to say in that space in that moment that I really more than anything wanted to understand how images could work how images did work and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives to work through these images fast forward and I end up in Harlem home for many of Black America very much the psychic heart of the black experience really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed Harlem now s of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century looking both backwards and forwards I always say Harlem is an interesting Community because unlike many other places it thinks of itself in the past present and the future simultaneously no one speaks of it just in the now it's always what it was and what it can be and in thinking about that then my second project the second question I ask is can a museum be a catalyst in a community can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves this is Harlem actually on January 20th thinking about itself in a very wonderful way so I work now at the studio Museum in Harlem thinking about exhibitions there thinking about what it means to discover Arts possibility now what does this mean to some of you in some cases I know that many of you are involved in cross-cultural dialogues you're involved in ideas of creativity and Innovation think about the place that artists can play in that that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that I work towards in working with young black artists think about artists not as content providers though they can be brilliant at that but again as real Catalyst the studio Museum was founded in the late 60s and I bring this up because it's important to locate this practice in history to look at 1968 in the incredible historic moment that is and think of the arc that has happened since then to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this Museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the leg Legacy of important African-American artists to the history of Art in this country like Jacob Lawrence Norman Lewis ramir Bearden and then of course to bring us to today in 1975 Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University after his lecture this A student got up and said to him give us a poem and Muhammad Ali said me we a profound statement about the individual and the community the space in which now in my project of discovery of thinking about artists of trying to Define what might be black art cultural movement of the 21st century what that might mean for cultural movements all over in this moment the miwe seems incredibly precient totally important to this end the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an F freestyle frequency and flow which have set out to discover and Define the young black artist working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years this series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now at this point in history to see art as a catalyst what it means now at this point in history as we Define and redefine culture Black Culture specifically in my case but culture generally I named this group of artists around an idea which I put out there called post black really meant to Define them as artists who came and start their work now looking back at history but star in this moment historically it is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking this new set of questions is what does it mean right now to be africanamerican in America what can artwork say about this where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation really most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring their works for me are about not always just simply about the aesthetic Innovation that their minds imagine that they Visions create and put out there in the world but more perhaps importantly through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation as well as in the future I am continually Amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be I am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work it is why I Look to Art it's why I ask questions of art it is why I make exhibitions now this exhibition as I said 40 Young Artists done over a course of eight years and for me it's about considering the implications it's considering the implications of this generation has to say to the rest of us it's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as work travels but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us it's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it and imagining particularly in urban America about the nurturing of this Spirit now where perhaps does this end up right now for me it is about reimagining this cultural discourse in an international context so the last iteration of this project has been call flow with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world really looking not so much from Harlem and out but looking across and Flo looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa and as many of us think about that continent and think about what it means to us all in the 21st century I have begun that looking through artists through artworks and imagining what they can tell us about the future with they tell us about our future and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue so what do I discover when I look at artworks what do I think about when I think about art I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works the discovery of exciting works but really it has been what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition to talk about beauty to talk about power to talk about ourselves and to talk and speak to each other that's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world thank [Applause] [Music] you

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the closest match would be a question that is not present in the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose from the generated MCQs, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match, but it's still not a good match. Question 8 asks about the speaker's main goal in curating exhibitions, and one of the options is "To create a platform for black artists", which is related to the idea of artists being catalysts, but it's not the same thing.

A better match would be a question that asks about how the speaker thinks of artists, with options that include "catalysts" as one of the answers.

Since there is no good match, I will not provide an index. However, I suggest generating new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Music] the brilliant playright audrianne Kennedy wrote a volume called people who have led my plays and if I were to write a volume it would be called artists who have led my exhibitions because my work in understanding art and in understanding culture has come by following artists by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are JJ from Good Times significant to many people of course because of Dino might but perhaps more significant as the first really black artist on prime time TV Jean Michelle basat important to me because the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what I was about to enter into my overall project is about art specifically about black artists very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves my interest is an artists who understand and rewrite history who think about themselves within The Narrative of the larger world of art but who have created new places for us to see and understand I'm showing two artists here Glenn Ligon and Carol Walker two of many who really form for me the essential questions that I wanted to bring as a curator to the world I was interested in the idea of why and how I could create create a new story a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world and to do this I knew that I had to see the way in which artists work understand the artist studio as a laboratory imagine then Reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper asking questions providing the space to look and to think about answers in 1994 when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum I made an exhibition called blackmail it looked at the intersection of race and gender in Contemporary American art it sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for a dialogue complicated dialogue dialogue with many many points of entry and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas this exhibition included over 20 artists of various ages and races but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view what was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator as a catalyst for this dialogue one of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people's understanding of themselves and each other I'm showing you two works one on the right by Leon golb one on the left by Robert kscott and in the course of the exhibition which was contentious controversial and ultimately for me life-changing in my sense of what art could be a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other and she pointed to the work on the Left To Tell me how problematic this image was as it related for her to the idea of how black people had been represented and she pointed to the image on the right as an example to me of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media she then assigned these Works racial identities basically saying to me that the work on the right clearly was made by a black artists the work on the left clearly by a white artist went in effect that was the opposite case Bob kott African-American artist Leon golb uh a a white artist the point of that for me was to say in that space in that moment that I really more than anything wanted to understand how images could work how images did work and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives to work through these images fast forward and I end up in Harlem home for many of Black America very much the psychic heart of the black experience really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed Harlem now s of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century looking both backwards and forwards I always say Harlem is an interesting Community because unlike many other places it thinks of itself in the past present and the future simultaneously no one speaks of it just in the now it's always what it was and what it can be and in thinking about that then my second project the second question I ask is can a museum be a catalyst in a community can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves this is Harlem actually on January 20th thinking about itself in a very wonderful way so I work now at the studio Museum in Harlem thinking about exhibitions there thinking about what it means to discover Arts possibility now what does this mean to some of you in some cases I know that many of you are involved in cross-cultural dialogues you're involved in ideas of creativity and Innovation think about the place that artists can play in that that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that I work towards in working with young black artists think about artists not as content providers though they can be brilliant at that but again as real Catalyst the studio Museum was founded in the late 60s and I bring this up because it's important to locate this practice in history to look at 1968 in the incredible historic moment that is and think of the arc that has happened since then to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this Museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the leg Legacy of important African-American artists to the history of Art in this country like Jacob Lawrence Norman Lewis ramir Bearden and then of course to bring us to today in 1975 Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University after his lecture this A student got up and said to him give us a poem and Muhammad Ali said me we a profound statement about the individual and the community the space in which now in my project of discovery of thinking about artists of trying to Define what might be black art cultural movement of the 21st century what that might mean for cultural movements all over in this moment the miwe seems incredibly precient totally important to this end the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an F freestyle frequency and flow which have set out to discover and Define the young black artist working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years this series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now at this point in history to see art as a catalyst what it means now at this point in history as we Define and redefine culture Black Culture specifically in my case but culture generally I named this group of artists around an idea which I put out there called post black really meant to Define them as artists who came and start their work now looking back at history but star in this moment historically it is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking this new set of questions is what does it mean right now to be africanamerican in America what can artwork say about this where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation really most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring their works for me are about not always just simply about the aesthetic Innovation that their minds imagine that they Visions create and put out there in the world but more perhaps importantly through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation as well as in the future I am continually Amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be I am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work it is why I Look to Art it's why I ask questions of art it is why I make exhibitions now this exhibition as I said 40 Young Artists done over a course of eight years and for me it's about considering the implications it's considering the implications of this generation has to say to the rest of us it's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as work travels but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us it's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it and imagining particularly in urban America about the nurturing of this Spirit now where perhaps does this end up right now for me it is about reimagining this cultural discourse in an international context so the last iteration of this project has been call flow with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world really looking not so much from Harlem and out but looking across and Flo looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa and as many of us think about that continent and think about what it means to us all in the 21st century I have begun that looking through artists through artworks and imagining what they can tell us about the future with they tell us about our future and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue so what do I discover when I look at artworks what do I think about when I think about art I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works the discovery of exciting works but really it has been what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition to talk about beauty to talk about power to talk about ourselves and to talk and speak to each other that's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world thank [Applause] [Music] you

very wonderful way so I work now at the studio Museum in Harlem thinking about exhibitions there thinking about what it means to discover Arts possibility now what does this mean to some of you in some cases I know that many of you are involved in cross-cultural dialogues you're involved in ideas of creativity and Innovation think about the place that artists can play in that that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that I work towards in working with young black artists think about artists not as content providers though they can be brilliant at that but again as real Catalyst the studio Museum was founded in the late 60s and I bring this up because it's important to locate this practice in history to look at 1968 in the incredible historic moment that is and think of the arc that has happened since then to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this Museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the leg Legacy of important African-American artists to the history of Art in this country like Jacob Lawrence Norman Lewis ramir Bearden and then of course to bring us to today in 1975 Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University after his lecture this A student got up and said to him give us a poem and Muhammad Ali said me we a profound statement about the individual and the community the space in which now in my project of discovery of thinking about artists of trying to Define what might be black art cultural movement of the 21st century what that might mean for cultural movements all over in this moment the miwe seems incredibly precient totally important to this end the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an F freestyle frequency and flow which have set out to discover and Define the young black artist working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years this series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now at this point in history to see art as a catalyst what it means now at this point in history as we Define and redefine culture Black Culture specifically in my case but culture generally I named this group of artists around an idea which I put out there called post black really meant to Define them as artists who came and start their work now looking back at history but star in this moment historically it is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking this new set of questions is what does it mean right now to be africanamerican in America what can artwork say about this where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation really most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring their works for me are about not always just simply about the aesthetic Innovation that their minds imagine that they Visions create and put out there in the world but more perhaps importantly through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation as well as in the future I am continually Amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be I am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work it is why I Look to Art it's why I ask questions of art it is why I make exhibitions now this exhibition as I said 40 Young Artists done over a course of eight years and for me it's about considering the implications it's considering the implications of this generation has to say to the rest of us it's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as work travels but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us it's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it and imagining particularly in urban America about the nurturing of this Spirit now where perhaps does this end up right now for me it is about reimagining this cultural discourse in an international context so the last iteration of this project has been call flow with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world really looking not so much from Harlem and out but looking across and Flo looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa and as many of us think about that continent and think about what it means to us all in the 21st century I have begun that looking through artists through artworks and imagining what they can tell us about the future with they tell us about our future and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue so what do I discover when I look at artworks what do I think about when I think about art I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works the discovery of exciting works but really it has been what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition to talk about beauty to talk about power to talk about ourselves and to talk and speak to each other that's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world thank [Applause] [Music] you

**Transcript**:
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe the child remains nonverbal all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers and I actually feel at home here because it's a lot of autism genetics here you wouldn't have any it's a continuum of traits when does a nerd turn into you know Asperger which is just mild autism I mean Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today and one of the things that really is going to concern me is getting these kids to to be the ones that are going to invent the next two energy things now that Bill Gates talked about this morning okay now if you want to understand autism animals and I want to talk to you about different ways of thinking you have to get away from verbal language I think in pictures I don't think in language now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details okay this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or pick out the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly and the thing is the normal brain ignores the details well if you're building a fridge details are pretty important because I'll fall down if you ignore the details and one of my big concerns is a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract people are getting away from doing hands-on stuff I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes because art and classes like that those are the classes where I accept okay in my work with cattle I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle book like for example is flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility this feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility all they needed to do was move the flag rapid movement contrast in the early 70s when I started I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing people thought that was crazy a code on offense would make em block shadows would make them bark a whole was on the floor people weren't noticing these things a chain hanging down and that's shown very very nicely in the movie in fact I loved the movie how they duplicated all my projects that's the geek side my drawings got the star in the movie too and actually it's called Temple Grandin not thinking in pictures so what is thinking in pictures it's literally movies in your hat my mind works like Google for Images now when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different I thought everybody thought in pictures and then when I did my book thinking in pictures I started interviewing people about how they think you know shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different like if I say think about a church steeple most people get this sort of generalized generic one now maybe that's not true in this room but it's going to be true in a lot of different places I see only specific pictures they flash up into my memory just like Google for pictures and in the movie they've got a great scene in there where the word shoe is said in a whole bunch of 50s and 60s shoes pop into my imagination okay there's my childhood Church that's specific there's some more Fort Collins okay how about famous ones and they just kind of come up kind of like this just really quickly like Google for pictures and they come up one at a time and then I think well okay well maybe we can have it snow or we can have a thunderstorm I can hold it there and turn them into videos now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities and I've worked really hard on improving on how cattle are treated at slaughter plant I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it but one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind just like a virtual reality computer system and this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie that was like just so super cool and there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and I had autism types working out there on the movie set too but one of the things that really worries me is where's the younger version of those kids going today they're not ending up in Silicon Valley where they belong now one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social is I had to sell my work and not myself and the way I sold livestock jobs as I showed off my drawings I showed off pictures of things another thing that helped me as a little kid is boy in the 50s you were taught manners you were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in a store and throw it around now when kids get to be in third or fourth grade you might see that this kid's gonna be a visual thinker drawing in perspective now I want to emphasize that not every autistic kids going to be a visual thinker now I did the head this brain scan done several years ago and I used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going a deep into my visual cortex this is tensor imaging and my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the controls the red lines there are me and the blue lines are the sex and age matched control and there I got a gigantic one and the control over there the blue one has got a really small one and some of the research now is showing that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex now the thing is the visual thinker is just one kind of mind you see the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind good at one thing they added something else and when I was bad with algebra and I was never allowed to take geometry or trig gigantic mistake I'm finding a lot of kids that need to skip algebra go right to geometry and trick now another kind of mind is the pattern thinker more abstract these are your engineers your computer programmers now this is pattern thinking that praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper no scotch tape no cuts and there in the background is the pattern for folding it here are the types of thinking photorealistic visual thinkers like me pattern thinkers music and math minds some of these oftentimes have problems with reading you also will see these kind of problems with them kids that are dyslexic you'll see these different kinds of minds and then there's a verbal mind they know every fact about everything now another thing is the sensory issues I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face and I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it and like they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin but sensory is an issue some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights others have problems with sound sensitivity you know on it's going to be variable now visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind because think about it an animal's a sensory based think are not verbal thinks in pictures thinks and sounds thinks and smells think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant he knows who's been there when they were there are they friend or foe is there anybody they'll mate with there's a ton of information on that fire hydrant it's all very detailed information and looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals now the animal mind and also my mind puts sensory-based information into categories man on a horse and a man on the ground that is viewed as two totally different things you can have a horse that's been abused by a rider they'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with a horse sure but you can't ride you have another horse where maybe the horseshoer beat them up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground or the veterinarian but a person can ride them cattle are the same way man on a horse a man on foot there are two different things you see it's a different picture see I want you to think about just how specific this is now this ability to put information into categories I find a lot of people are not very good at this like when I'm out troubleshooting with equipment or problems with something in a plant they don't seem to be able to figure out do I have a training people issue or do I have something wrong with the equipment in other words categorizing equipment problem from a people problem I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that now let's say I figure out is an equipment problem is it a minor problem with something simple I can fix or is a whole design of the system wrong people have a hard time figuring that out let's just look at something like you know solving problems with y'all making airlines safer yeah I'm a million-mile flyer I do lots and lots of flying and then you know like if I was at the FFA what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of it would be their airplane tails you know five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years tail either came off or coasteering stuff inside the tail broke in some way its tails pure and simple and when the pilots walk around the plane guess what they can't see that stuff inside the tail you know now as I think about that I'm pulling up all of that you know specific information it's specific see my thinking's bottom up I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle now here's a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats you've been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat white cowboy hats that was absolutely fine now the thing is the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together we've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds and one of the things that's driving me really crazy so I travel around than I do autism meetings is I'm seeing a lot of smart geeky nerdy kids and they just aren't very social and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science this brings up the whole thing on my science teacher my science teacher has shown absolutely beautifully in the movie as a goof ball student when I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying until I had on mr. carlock's science class he was now dr. Carlock in the movie and he he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room this brings up the whole thing he got to show kids interesting stuff you know one of the things that I think maybe Ted ought to do is done tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on Ted there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids and the teachers out in the Midwest and other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas they don't know they do with these kids and they're not going down the right path the thing is you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind or a mind can be wired to be more social and what some of the research now is showing autism is there may be extra wiring back here and then really brilliant mine and we lose a few social circuits here it's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social and then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be nonverbal in the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals this is the work of dr. Bruce Miller and he studied alzheimerís patients they had frontal temporal lobe dementia and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain and then this artwork came out of somebody that used to install stereos and cars now van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this Eddy pattern and his painting followed a statistical model of turbulence this brings up a whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head and the Wolfram stuff I was taking notes I was write down all the all the search words I could use because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures we've got a show these kids to interesting stuff and they've taken out the auto shop class and the drafting class in the art class I mean art was my best subject in school we've got to think about all these different kinds of minds and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future and let's talk about jobs okay my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball it didn't want to study but you know what I was getting work experience I'm seeing too many these smart kids that haven't learned basic things like how to be on time I was taught that when I was eight years old you know how to have table manners at Granny's at Sunday party I was taught that when I was very very young and when I was 13 I had a job at a dressmakers shop by selling clothes I did internships in college I did I was building things and I also had to learn how to do assignments you know all I want to do is draw pictures the horses when I was little mother said well let's do a picture of something else they got to learn how to do something else let's say the kids fixated on leg let's get them working on building different things think about the autistic mind as it tends to be fixated like if the kid loves race cars let's use race cars for math let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance in other words use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that's one of the things we need to do and really get fed up when the you know the teachers when especially when you get away from this part of the country they don't know what to do with these smart kids it just drives me crazy what can visual thinkers do when they grow up they can do graphic design all kinds of stuff with computers photography Industrial Design on the pattern thinkers they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers all of those kinds of jobs and then you've got the word minds they make great journalists and they're also make really really good stage actors because the thing about being autistic is I had to learn social skills like being in a play it just kind of just have to learn it and we need to be working with these students and this brings up mentors you know my science teacher was not an accredited teacher he was a NASA space scientist now some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or degree in chemistry you can come into the school and teach you know biology or chemistry we need to be doing that because what I'm observing is the good teachers for a lot of these kids are out in the community colleges but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools another thing that can be very very very successful is there's a lot of people that may have retired from you know working in the software industry and they can teach a kid and it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark you get nected turned on and you get them turned on then you'll learn all the new stuff mentors are just essential I can't emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me and we've got to mentor them hire them and if you bring them in for internships and your company's the thing about the autism Asperger II kind of mine you got to give a specific task don't just say design new software you're going to tell them something a lot more specific well we're designing a software for phone and it has to do some specific thing and it can only use so much memory that's the kind of specificity you need well that's the end of my talk and I just want to thank everybody for coming it was great to be here oh yeah question for me okay thank you thank you so much for that you know you once wrote I like this quote if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave hey guys who do you think made the first stone spear Jose Asperger guy and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetic said they know more Silicon Valley and the energy crisis would not be solved someone shot you a couple of the questions and you know if any of these feel inappropriate it's okay to say next question but if if there's someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them what advice would you give them well first of all I got a look at age if you have a two three or four year old you know no speech no social interaction I can't emphasize enough don't wait you need to at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching you know thing as autism comes in different degrees there's going about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn the talk and they're not gonna be working in Silicon Valley that would that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do but then you got these smart geeky kids you know the touch of autism and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things I got social interaction through shared interests I rode horses with other kids I made model rockets with other kids did electronics lab you know without the kids and then 60s it was gluing mirrors on the under rubber membrane on speaker to make a light shell that was like we can serve that super cool look is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them as some might most well let me tell you that child will be loyal if the house is burning down they're gonna get you out of it Wow so most people if you ask them what are they most passionate about that say things like my kids or or my lover or what are you most passionate about I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place when I have a mother of an autistic child say my kid went to college because of your book or something or wanting our lectures that makes me happy you know like the slaughter plants I've worked with them in the 80s they were absolutely awful I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many cattle got poked with the Prada how many cattle are moving their heads off and it's very very simple you met you directly observe a few simple things it's worked really well I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world we need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stone what are you talking on the phone one of the things you said that really astonished me was he said one thing you were passionate about was server farms talk about the reason why I got really excited I read about that it's contains knowledge its libraries and to me knowledge is something that is extremely valuable so maybe over 10 years ago now our library got flooded this is before the internet got really big and I was really upset of all the books being wrecked because it was knowledge being destroyed and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge temple can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at Ted well thank you so much thank you

different ways of thinking you have to get away from verbal language I think in pictures I don't think in language now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details okay this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or pick out the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly and the thing is the normal brain ignores the details well if you're building a fridge details are pretty important because I'll fall down if you ignore the details and one of my big concerns is a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract people are getting away from doing hands-on stuff I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes because art and classes like that those are the classes where I accept okay in my work with cattle I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle book like for example is flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility this feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility all they needed to do was move the flag rapid movement contrast in the early 70s when I started I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing people thought that was crazy a code on offense would make em block shadows would make them bark a whole was on the floor people weren't noticing these things a chain hanging down and that's shown very very nicely in the movie in fact I loved the movie how they duplicated all my projects that's the geek side my drawings got the star in the movie too and actually it's called Temple Grandin not thinking in pictures so what is thinking in pictures it's literally movies in your hat my mind works like Google for Images now when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different I thought everybody thought in pictures and then when I did my book thinking in pictures I started interviewing people about how they think you know shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different like if I say think about a church steeple most people get this sort of generalized generic one now maybe that's not true in this room but it's going to be true in a lot of different places I see only specific pictures they flash up into my memory just like Google for pictures and in the movie they've got a great scene in there where the word shoe is said in a whole bunch of 50s and 60s shoes pop into my imagination okay there's my childhood Church that's specific there's some more Fort Collins okay how about famous ones and they just kind of come up kind of like this just really quickly like Google for pictures and they come up one at a time and then I think well okay well maybe we can have it snow or we can have a thunderstorm I can hold it there and turn them into videos now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities and I've worked really hard on improving on how cattle are treated at slaughter plant I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it but one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind just like a virtual reality computer system and this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie that was like just so super cool and there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and I had autism types working out there on the movie set too but one of the things that really worries me is where's the younger version of those kids going today they're not ending up in Silicon Valley where they belong now one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social is I had to sell my work and not myself and the way I sold livestock jobs as I showed off my drawings I showed off pictures of things another thing that helped me as a little kid is boy in the 50s you were taught manners you were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in a store and throw it around now when kids get to be in third or fourth grade you might see that this kid's gonna be a visual thinker drawing in perspective now I want to emphasize that not every autistic kids going to be a visual thinker now I did the head this brain scan done several years ago and I used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going a deep into my visual cortex this is tensor imaging and my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the controls the red lines there are me and the blue lines are the sex and age matched control and there I got a gigantic one and the control over there the blue one has got a really small one and some of the research now is showing that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex now the thing is the visual thinker is just one kind of mind you see the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind good at one thing they added something else and when I was bad with algebra and I was never allowed to take geometry or trig gigantic mistake I'm finding a lot of kids that need to skip algebra go right to geometry and trick now another kind of mind is the pattern thinker more abstract these are your engineers your computer programmers now this is pattern thinking that praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper no scotch tape no cuts and there in the background is the pattern for folding it here are the types of thinking photorealistic visual thinkers like me pattern thinkers music and math minds some of these oftentimes have problems with reading you also will see these kind of problems with them kids that are dyslexic you'll see these different kinds of minds and then there's a verbal mind they know every fact about everything now another thing is the sensory issues I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face and I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it and like they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin but sensory is an issue some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights others have problems with sound sensitivity you know on it's going to be variable now visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind because think about it an animal's a sensory based think are not verbal thinks in pictures thinks and sounds thinks and smells think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant he knows who's been there when they were there are they friend or foe is there anybody they'll mate with there's a ton of information on that fire hydrant it's all very detailed information and looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals now the animal mind and also my mind puts sensory-based information into categories man on a horse and a man on the ground that is viewed as two totally different things you can have a horse that's been abused by a rider they'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with a horse sure but you can't ride you have another horse where maybe the horseshoer beat them up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground or the veterinarian but a person can ride them cattle are the same way man on a horse a man on foot there are two different things you see it's a different picture see I want you to think about just how specific this is now this ability to put information into categories I find a lot of people are not very good at this like when I'm out troubleshooting with equipment or problems with something in a plant they don't seem to be able to figure out do I have a training people issue or do I have something wrong with the equipment in other words categorizing equipment problem from a people problem I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that now let's say I figure out is an equipment problem is it a minor problem with something simple I can fix or is a whole design of the system wrong people have a hard time figuring that out let's just look at something like you know solving problems with y'all making airlines safer yeah I'm a million-mile flyer I do lots and lots of flying and then you know like if I was at the FFA what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of it would be their airplane tails you know five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years tail either came off or coasteering stuff inside the tail broke in some way its tails pure and simple and when the pilots walk around the plane guess what they can't see that stuff inside the tail you know now as I think about that I'm pulling up all of that you know specific information it's specific see my thinking's bottom up I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle now here's a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats you've been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat white cowboy hats that was absolutely fine now the thing is the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together we've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds and one of the things that's driving me really crazy so I travel around than I do autism meetings is I'm seeing a lot of smart geeky nerdy kids and they just aren't very social and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science this brings up the whole thing on my science teacher my science teacher has shown absolutely beautifully in the movie as a goof ball student when I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying until I had on mr. carlock's science class he was now dr. Carlock in the movie and he he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room this brings up the whole thing he got to show kids interesting stuff you know one of the things that I think maybe Ted ought to do is done tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on Ted there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids and the teachers out in the Midwest and other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas they don't know they do with these kids and they're not going down the right path the thing is you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind or a mind can be wired to be more social and what some of the research now is showing autism is there may be extra wiring back here and then really brilliant mine and we lose a few social circuits here it's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social and then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be nonverbal in the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals this is the work of dr. Bruce Miller and he studied alzheimerís patients they had frontal temporal lobe dementia and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain and then this artwork came out of somebody that used to install stereos and cars now van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this Eddy pattern and his painting followed a statistical model of turbulence this brings up a whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head and the Wolfram stuff I was taking notes I was write down all the all the search words I could use because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures we've got a show these kids to interesting stuff and they've taken out the auto shop class and the drafting class in the art class I mean art was my best subject in school we've got to think about all these different kinds of minds and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future and let's talk about jobs okay my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball it didn't want to study but you know what I was getting work experience I'm seeing too many these smart kids that haven't learned basic things like how to be on time I was taught that when I was eight years old you know how to have table manners at Granny's at Sunday party I was taught that when I was very very young and when I was 13 I had a job at a dressmakers shop by selling clothes I did internships in college I did I was building things and I also had to learn how to do assignments you know all I want to do is draw pictures the horses when I was little mother said well let's do a picture of something else they got to learn how to do something else let's say the kids fixated on leg let's get them working on building different things think about the autistic mind as it tends to be fixated like if the kid loves race cars let's use race cars for math let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance in other words use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that's one of the things we need to do and really get fed up when the you know the teachers when especially when you get away from this part of the country they don't know what to do with these smart kids it just drives me crazy what can visual thinkers do when they grow up they can do graphic design all kinds of stuff with computers photography Industrial Design on the pattern thinkers they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers all of those kinds of jobs and then you've got the word minds they make great journalists and they're also make really really good stage actors because the thing about being autistic is I had to learn social skills like being in a play it just kind of just have to learn it and we need to be working with these students and this brings up mentors you know my science teacher was not an accredited teacher he was a NASA space scientist now some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or degree in chemistry you can come into the school and teach you know biology or chemistry we need to be doing that because what I'm observing is the good teachers for a lot of these kids are out in the community colleges but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools another thing that can be very very very successful is there's a lot of people that may have retired from you know working in the software industry and they can teach a kid and it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark you get nected turned on and you get them turned on then you'll learn all the new stuff mentors are just essential I can't emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me and we've got to mentor them hire them and if you bring them in for internships and your company's the thing about the autism Asperger II kind of mine you got to give a specific task don't just say design new software you're going to tell them something a lot more specific well we're designing a software for phone and it has to do some specific thing and it can only use so much memory that's the kind of specificity you need well that's the end of my talk and I just want to thank everybody for coming it was great to be here oh yeah question for me okay thank you thank you so much for that you know you once wrote I like this quote if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave hey guys who do you think made the first stone spear Jose Asperger guy and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetic said they know more Silicon Valley and the energy crisis would not be solved someone shot you a couple of the questions and you know if any of these feel inappropriate it's okay to say next question but if if there's someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them what advice would you give them well first of all I got a look at age if you have a two three or four year old you know no speech no social interaction I can't emphasize enough don't wait you need to at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching you know thing as autism comes in different degrees there's going about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn the talk and they're not gonna be working in Silicon Valley that would that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do but then you got these smart geeky kids you know the touch of autism and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things I got social interaction through shared interests I rode horses with other kids I made model rockets with other kids did electronics lab you know without the kids and then 60s it was gluing mirrors on the under rubber membrane on speaker to make a light shell that was like we can serve that super cool look is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them as some might most well let me tell you that child will be loyal if the house is burning down they're gonna get you out of it Wow so most people if you ask them what are they most passionate about that say things like my kids or or my lover or what are you most passionate about I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place when I have a mother of an autistic child say my kid went to college because of your book or something or wanting our lectures that makes me happy you know like the slaughter plants I've worked with them in the 80s they were absolutely awful I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many cattle got poked with the Prada how many cattle are moving their heads off and it's very very simple you met you directly observe a few simple things it's worked really well I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world we need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stone what are you talking on the phone one of the things you said that really astonished me was he said one thing you were passionate about was server farms talk about the reason why I got really excited I read about that it's contains knowledge its libraries and to me knowledge is something that is extremely valuable so maybe over 10 years ago now our library got flooded this is before the internet got really big and I was really upset of all the books being wrecked because it was knowledge being destroyed and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge temple can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at Ted well thank you so much thank you

**Transcript**:
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe the child remains nonverbal all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers and I actually feel at home here because it's a lot of autism genetics here you wouldn't have any it's a continuum of traits when does a nerd turn into you know Asperger which is just mild autism I mean Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today and one of the things that really is going to concern me is getting these kids to to be the ones that are going to invent the next two energy things now that Bill Gates talked about this morning okay now if you want to understand autism animals and I want to talk to you about different ways of thinking you have to get away from verbal language I think in pictures I don't think in language now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details okay this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or pick out the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly and the thing is the normal brain ignores the details well if you're building a fridge details are pretty important because I'll fall down if you ignore the details and one of my big concerns is a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract people are getting away from doing hands-on stuff I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes because art and classes like that those are the classes

learn how to do something else let's say the kids fixated on leg let's get them working on building different things think about the autistic mind as it tends to be fixated like if the kid loves race cars let's use race cars for math let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance in other words use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that's one of the things we need to do and really get fed up when the you know the teachers when especially when you get away from this part of the country they don't know what to do with these smart kids it just drives me crazy what can visual thinkers do when they grow up they can do graphic design all kinds of stuff with computers photography Industrial Design on the pattern thinkers they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers all of those kinds of jobs and then you've got the word minds they make great journalists and they're also make really really good stage actors because the thing about being autistic is I had to learn social skills like being in a play it just kind of just have to learn it and we need to be working with these students and this brings up mentors you know my science teacher was not an accredited teacher he was a NASA space scientist now some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or degree in chemistry you can come into the school and teach you know biology or chemistry we need to be doing that because what I'm observing is the good teachers for a lot of these kids are out in the community colleges but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools another thing that can be very very very successful is there's a lot of people that may have retired from you know working in the software industry and they can teach a kid and it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark you get nected turned on and you get them turned on then you'll learn all the new stuff mentors are just essential I can't emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me and we've got to mentor them hire them and if you bring them in for internships and your company's the thing about the autism Asperger II kind of mine you got to give a specific task don't just say design new software you're going to tell them something a lot more specific well we're designing a software for phone and it has to do some specific thing and it can only use so much memory that's the kind of specificity you need well that's the end of my talk and I just want to thank everybody for coming it was great to be here oh yeah question for me okay thank you thank you so much for that you know you once wrote I like this quote if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave hey guys who do you think made the first stone spear Jose Asperger guy and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetic said they know more Silicon Valley and the energy crisis would not be solved someone shot you a couple of the questions and you know if any of these feel inappropriate it's okay to say next question but if if there's someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them what advice would you give them well first of all I got a look at age if you have a two three or four year old you know no speech no social interaction I can't emphasize enough don't wait you need to at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching you know thing as autism comes in different degrees there's going about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn the talk and they're not gonna be working in Silicon Valley that would that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do but then you got these smart geeky kids you know the touch of autism and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things I got social interaction through shared interests I rode horses with other kids I made model rockets with other kids did electronics lab you know without the kids and then 60s it was gluing mirrors on the under rubber membrane on speaker to make a light shell that was like we can serve that super cool look is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them as some might most well let me tell you that child will be loyal if the house is burning down they're gonna get you out of it Wow so most people if you ask them what are they most passionate about that say things like my kids or or my lover or what are you most passionate about I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place when I have a mother of an autistic child say my kid went to college because of your book or something or wanting our lectures that makes me happy you know like the slaughter plants I've worked with them in the 80s they were absolutely awful I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many cattle got poked with the Prada how many cattle are moving their heads off and it's very very simple you met you directly observe a few simple things it's worked really well I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world we need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stone what are you talking on the phone one of the things you said that really astonished me was he said one thing you were passionate about was server farms talk about the reason why I got really excited I read about that it's contains knowledge its libraries and to me knowledge is something that is extremely valuable so maybe over 10 years ago now our library got flooded this is before the internet got really big and I was really upset of all the books being wrecked because it was knowledge being destroyed and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge temple can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at Ted well thank you so much thank you

**Transcript**:
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe the child remains nonverbal all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers and I actually feel at home here because it's a lot of autism genetics here you wouldn't have any it's a continuum of traits when does a nerd turn into you know Asperger which is just mild autism I mean Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today and one of the things that really is going to concern me is getting these kids to to be the ones that are going to invent the next two energy things now that Bill Gates talked about this morning okay now if you want to understand autism animals and I want to talk to you about different ways of thinking you have to get away from verbal language I think in pictures I don't think in language now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details okay this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or pick out the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly and the thing is the normal brain ignores the details well if you're building a fridge details are pretty important because I'll fall down if you ignore the details and one of my big concerns is a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract people are getting away from doing hands-on stuff I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes because art and classes like that those are the classes where I accept okay in my work with cattle I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle book like for example is flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility this feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility all they needed to do was move the flag rapid movement contrast in the early 70s when I started I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing people thought that was crazy a code on offense would make em block shadows would make them bark a whole was on the floor people weren't noticing these things a chain hanging down and that's shown very very nicely in the movie in fact I loved the movie how they duplicated all my projects that's the geek side my drawings got the star in the movie too and actually it's called Temple Grandin not thinking in pictures so what is thinking in pictures it's literally movies in your hat my mind works like Google for Images now when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different I thought everybody thought in pictures and then when I did my book thinking in pictures I started interviewing people about how they think you know shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different like if I say think about a church steeple most people get this sort of generalized generic one now maybe that's not true in this room but it's going to be true in a lot of different places I see only specific pictures they flash up into my memory just like Google for pictures and in the movie they've got a great scene in there where the word shoe is said in a whole bunch of 50s and 60s shoes pop into my imagination okay there's my childhood Church that's specific there's some more Fort Collins okay how about famous ones and they just kind of come up kind of like this just really quickly like Google for pictures and they come up one at a time and then I think well okay well maybe we can have it snow or we can have a thunderstorm I can hold it there and turn them into videos now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities and I've worked really hard on improving on how cattle are treated at slaughter plant I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it but one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind just like a virtual reality computer system and this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie that was like just so super cool and there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and I had autism types working out there on the movie set too but one of the things that really worries me is where's the younger version of those kids going today they're not ending up in Silicon Valley where they belong now one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social is I had to sell my work and not myself and the way I sold livestock jobs as I showed off my drawings I showed off pictures of things another thing that helped me as a little kid is boy in the 50s you were taught manners you were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in a store and throw it around now when kids get to be in third or fourth grade you might see that this kid's gonna be a visual thinker drawing in perspective now I want to emphasize that not every autistic kids going to be a visual thinker now I did the head this brain scan done several years ago and I used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going a deep into my visual cortex this is tensor imaging and my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the controls the red lines there are me and the blue lines are the sex and age matched control and there I got a gigantic one and the control over there the blue one has got a really small one and some of the research now is showing that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex now the thing is the visual thinker is just one kind of mind you see the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind good at one thing they added something else and when I was bad with algebra and I was never allowed to take geometry or trig gigantic mistake I'm finding a lot of kids that need to skip algebra go right to geometry and trick now another kind of mind is the pattern thinker more abstract these are your engineers your computer programmers now this is pattern thinking that praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper no scotch tape no cuts and there in the background is the pattern for folding it here are the types of thinking photorealistic visual thinkers like me pattern thinkers music and math minds some of these oftentimes have problems with reading you also will see these kind of problems with them kids that are dyslexic you'll see these different kinds of minds and then there's a verbal mind they know every fact about everything now another thing is the sensory issues I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face and I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it and like they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin but sensory is an issue some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights others have problems with sound sensitivity you know on it's going to be variable now visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind because think about it an animal's a sensory based think are not verbal thinks in pictures thinks and sounds thinks and smells think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant he knows who's been there when they were there are they friend or foe is there anybody they'll mate with there's a ton of information on that fire hydrant it's all very detailed information and looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals now the animal mind and also my mind puts sensory-based information into categories man on a horse and a man on the ground that is viewed as two totally different things you can have a horse that's been abused by a rider they'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with a horse sure but you can't ride you have another horse where maybe the horseshoer beat them up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground or the veterinarian but a person can ride them cattle are the same way man on a horse a man on foot there are two different things you see it's a different picture see I want you to think about just how specific this is now this ability to put information into categories I find a lot of people are not very good at this like when I'm out troubleshooting with equipment or problems with something in a plant they don't seem to be able to figure out do I have a training people issue or do I have something wrong with the equipment in other words categorizing equipment problem from a people problem I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that now let's say I figure out is an equipment problem is it a minor problem with something simple I can fix or is a whole design of the system wrong people have a hard time figuring that out let's just look at something like you know solving problems with y'all making airlines safer yeah I'm a million-mile flyer I do lots and lots of flying and then you know like if I was at the FFA what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of it would be their airplane tails you know five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years tail either came off or coasteering stuff inside the tail broke in some way its tails pure and simple and when the pilots walk around the plane guess what they can't see that stuff inside the tail you know now as I think about that I'm pulling up all of that you know specific information it's specific see my thinking's bottom up I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle now here's a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats you've been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat white cowboy hats that was absolutely fine now the thing is the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together we've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds and one of the things that's driving me really crazy so I travel around than I do autism meetings is I'm seeing a lot of smart geeky nerdy kids and they just aren't very social and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science this brings up the whole thing on my science teacher my science teacher has shown absolutely beautifully in the movie as a goof ball student when I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying until I had on mr. carlock's science class he was now dr. Carlock in the movie and he he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room this brings up the whole thing he got to show kids interesting stuff you know one of the things that I think maybe Ted ought to do is done tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on Ted there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids and the teachers out in the Midwest and other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas they don't know they do with these kids and they're not going down the right path the thing is you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind or a mind can be wired to be more social and what some of the research now is showing autism is there may be extra wiring back here and then really brilliant mine and we lose a few social circuits here it's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social and then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be nonverbal in the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals this is the work of dr. Bruce Miller and he studied alzheimerís patients they had frontal temporal lobe dementia and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain and then this artwork came out of somebody that used to install stereos and cars now van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this Eddy pattern and his painting followed a statistical model of turbulence this brings up a whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head and the Wolfram stuff I was taking notes I was write down all the all the search words I could use because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures we've got a show these kids to interesting stuff and they've taken out the auto shop class and the drafting class in the art class I mean art was my best subject in school we've got to think about all these different kinds of minds and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future and let's talk about jobs okay my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball it didn't want to study but you know what I was getting work experience I'm seeing too many these smart kids that haven't learned basic things like how to be on time I was taught that when I was eight years old you know how to have table manners at Granny's at Sunday party I was taught that when I was very very young and when I was 13 I had a job at a dressmakers shop by selling clothes I did internships in college I did I was building things and I also had to learn how to do assignments you know all I want to do is draw pictures the horses when I was little mother said well let's do a picture of something else they got to learn how to do something else let's say the kids fixated on leg let's get them working on building different things think about the autistic mind as it tends to be fixated like if the kid loves race cars let's use race cars for math let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance in other words use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that's one of the things we need to do and really get fed up when the you know the teachers when especially when you get away from this part of the country they don't know what to do with these smart kids it just drives me crazy what can visual thinkers do when they grow up they can do graphic design all kinds of stuff with computers photography Industrial Design on the pattern thinkers they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers all of those kinds of jobs and then you've got the word minds they make great journalists and they're also make really really good stage actors because the thing about being autistic is I had to learn social skills like being in a play it just kind of just have to learn it and we need to be working with these students and this brings up mentors you know my science teacher was not an accredited teacher he was a NASA space scientist now some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or degree in chemistry you can come into the school and teach you know biology or chemistry we need to be doing that because what I'm observing is the good teachers for a lot of these kids are out in the community colleges but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools another thing that can be very very very successful is there's a lot of people that may have retired from you know working in the software industry and they can teach a kid and it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark you get nected turned on and you get them turned on then you'll learn all the new stuff mentors are just essential I can't emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me and we've got to mentor them hire them and if you bring them in for internships and your company's the thing about the autism Asperger II kind of mine you got to give a specific task don't just say design new software you're going to tell them something a lot more specific well we're designing a software for phone and it has to do some specific thing and it can only use so much memory that's the kind of specificity you need well that's the end of my talk and I just want to thank everybody for coming it was great to be here oh yeah question for me okay thank you thank you so much for that you know you once wrote I like this quote if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave hey guys who do you think made the first stone spear Jose Asperger guy and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetic said they know more Silicon Valley and the energy crisis would not be solved someone shot you a couple of the questions and you know if any of these feel inappropriate it's okay to say next question but if if there's someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them what advice would you give them well first of all I got a look at age if you have a two three or four year old you know no speech no social interaction I can't emphasize enough don't wait you need to at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching you know thing as autism comes in different degrees there's going about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn the talk and they're not gonna be working in Silicon Valley that would that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do but then you got these smart geeky kids you know the touch of autism and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things I got social interaction through shared interests I rode horses with other kids I made model rockets with other kids did electronics lab you know without the kids and then 60s it was gluing mirrors on the under rubber membrane on speaker to make a light shell that was like we can serve that super cool look is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them as some might most well let me tell you that child will be loyal if the house is burning down they're gonna get you out of it Wow so most people if you ask them what are they most passionate about that say things like my kids or or my lover or what are you most passionate about I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place when I have a mother of an autistic child say my kid went to college because of your book or something or wanting our lectures that makes me happy you know like the slaughter plants I've worked with them in the 80s they were absolutely awful I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many cattle got poked with the Prada how many cattle are moving their heads off and it's very very simple you met you directly observe a few simple things it's worked really well I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world we need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stone what are you talking on the phone one of the things you said that really astonished me was he said one thing you were passionate about was server farms talk about the reason why I got really excited I read about that it's contains knowledge its libraries and to me knowledge is something that is extremely valuable so maybe over 10 years ago now our library got flooded this is before the internet got really big and I was really upset of all the books being wrecked because it was knowledge being destroyed and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge temple can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at Ted well thank you so much thank you

**Transcript**:
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe the child remains nonverbal all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers and I actually feel at home here because it's a lot of autism genetics here you wouldn't have any it's a continuum of traits when does a nerd turn into you know Asperger which is just mild autism I mean Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today and one of the things that really is going to concern me is getting these kids to to be the ones that are going to invent the next two energy things now that Bill Gates talked about this morning okay now if you want to understand autism animals and I want to talk to you about different ways of thinking you have to get away from verbal language I think in pictures I don't think in language now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details okay this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or pick out the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly and the thing is the normal brain ignores the details well if you're building a fridge details are pretty important because I'll fall down if you ignore the details and one of my big concerns is a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract people are getting away from doing hands-on stuff I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes because art and classes like that those are the classes where I accept okay in my work with cattle I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle book like for example is flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility this feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility all they needed to do was move the flag rapid movement contrast in the early 70s when I started I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing people thought that was crazy a code on offense would make em block shadows would make them bark a whole was on the floor people weren't noticing these things a chain hanging down and that's shown very very nicely in the movie in fact I loved the movie how they duplicated all my projects that's the geek side my drawings got the star in the movie too and actually it's called Temple Grandin not thinking in pictures so what is thinking in pictures it's literally movies in your hat my mind works like Google for Images now when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different I thought everybody thought in pictures and then when I did my book thinking in pictures I started interviewing people about how they think you know shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different like if I say think about a church steeple most people get this sort of generalized generic one now maybe that's not true in this room but it's going to be true in a lot of different places I see only specific pictures they flash up into my memory just like Google for pictures and in the movie they've got a great scene in there where the word shoe is said in a whole bunch of 50s and 60s shoes pop into my imagination okay there's my childhood Church that's specific there's some more Fort Collins okay how about famous ones and they just kind of come up kind of like this just really quickly like Google for pictures and they come up one at a time and then I think well okay well maybe we can have it snow or we can have a thunderstorm I can hold it there and turn them into videos now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities and I've worked really hard on improving on how cattle are treated at slaughter plant I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it but one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind just like a virtual reality computer system and this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie that was like just so super cool and there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and I had autism types working out there on the movie set too but one of the things that really worries me is where's the younger version of those kids going today they're not ending up in Silicon Valley where they belong now one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social is I had to sell my work and not myself and the way I sold livestock jobs as I showed off my drawings I showed off pictures of things another thing that helped me as a little kid is boy in the 50s you were taught manners you were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in a store and throw it around now when kids get to be in third or fourth grade you might see that this kid's gonna be a visual thinker drawing in perspective now I want to emphasize that not every autistic kids going to be a visual thinker now I did the head this brain scan done several years ago and I used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going a deep into my visual cortex this is tensor imaging and my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the controls the red lines there are me and the blue lines are the sex and age matched control and there I got a gigantic one and the control over there the blue one has got a really small one and some of the research now is showing that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex now the thing is the visual thinker is just one kind of mind you see the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind good at one thing they added something else and when I was bad with algebra and I was never allowed to take geometry or trig gigantic mistake I'm finding a lot of kids that need to skip algebra go right to geometry and trick now another kind of mind is the pattern thinker more abstract these are your engineers your computer programmers now this is pattern thinking that praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper no scotch tape no cuts and there in the background is the pattern for folding it here are the types of thinking photorealistic visual thinkers like me pattern thinkers music and math minds some of these oftentimes have problems with reading you also will see these kind of problems with them kids that are dyslexic you'll see these different kinds of minds and then there's a verbal mind they know every fact about everything now another thing is the sensory issues I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face and I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it and like they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin but sensory is an issue some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights others have problems with sound sensitivity you know on it's going to be variable now visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind because think about it an animal's a sensory based think are not verbal thinks in pictures thinks and sounds thinks and smells think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant he knows who's been there when they were there are they friend or foe is there anybody they'll mate with there's a ton of information on that fire hydrant it's all very detailed information and looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals now the animal mind and also my mind puts sensory-based information into categories man on a horse and a man on the ground that is viewed as two totally different things you can have a horse that's been abused by a rider they'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with a horse sure but you can't ride you have another horse where maybe the horseshoer beat them up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground or the veterinarian but a person can ride them cattle are the same way man on a horse a man on foot there are two different things you see it's a different picture see I want you to think about just how specific this is now this ability to put information into categories I find a lot of people are not very good at this like when I'm out troubleshooting with equipment or problems with something in a plant they don't seem to be able to figure out do I have a training people issue or do I have something wrong with the equipment in other words categorizing equipment problem from a people problem I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that now let's say I figure out is an equipment problem is it a minor problem with something simple I can fix or is a whole design of the system wrong people have a hard time figuring that out let's just look at something like you know solving problems with y'all making airlines safer yeah I'm a million-mile flyer I do lots and lots of flying and then you know like if I was at the FFA what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of it would be their airplane tails you know five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years tail either came off or coasteering stuff inside the tail broke in some way its tails pure and simple and when the pilots walk around the plane guess what they can't see that stuff inside the tail you know now as I think about that I'm pulling up all of that you know specific information it's specific see my thinking's bottom up I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle now here's a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats you've been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat white cowboy hats that was absolutely fine now the thing is the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together we've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds and one of the things that's driving me really crazy so I travel around than I do autism meetings is I'm seeing a lot of smart geeky nerdy kids and they just aren't very social and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science this brings up the whole thing on my science teacher my science teacher has shown absolutely beautifully in the movie as a goof ball student when I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying until I had on mr. carlock's science class he was now dr. Carlock in the movie and he he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room this brings up the whole thing he got to show kids interesting stuff you know one of the things that I think maybe Ted ought to do is done tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on Ted there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids and the teachers out in the Midwest and other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas they don't know they do with these kids and they're not going down the right path the thing is you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind or a mind can be wired to be more social and what some of the research now is showing autism is there may be extra wiring back here and then really brilliant mine and we lose a few social circuits here it's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social and then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be nonverbal in the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals this is the work of dr.

[Music] let's pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool Teddy Sh'ma sheen and it's a time machine and everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and I wonder what you'd choose because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back I don't know they want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or American Idol I don't know I'm unconvinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and I understand that I'm not part of that crowd I have to say I don't want to go back and it's not because I'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so I want to get in the machine and I want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great-grandparents died all of them by the time they were 60 my grandparents push that number to 70 my parents are closing in on 80 so I there better be it there better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did a hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has it's gone it's vanished we vanquished it poof in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly diphtheria rubella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the News because there are some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all their accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's disgraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rain forests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away too so the question is can we do that and I I think we can I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it I really do believe that and know it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we battled Progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know what you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago I wrote a story about vaccines from The New Yorker a little story and I was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history I know what to do so I just did what I do I wrote a story and I moved on and soon after that I wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so I wrote a story about that too and I couldn't understand why people thought this was frankenfoods why they thought molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know I do what I do I wrote the story I moved on I mean I'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and I couldn't figure out why and eventually I did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it it just disturbed me so much but then I thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress okay there are reasons for that and I think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there there's no reason we shouldn't have you can just say a few names and people will understand Chernobyl Bhopal the Challenger Vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads I mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that I've never seen and hope never to see again about 12 years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles months in rubella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's Anna serious issue the data came back the data came back from the United States from England from Sweden from Canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe does we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and I do understand that I think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here's a fact the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible and what kind of what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now I understand it I do understand it because anyone have measles here does one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles doesn't happen very much doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King lives and they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero Jonas Salk he took one of the worst scourge of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio poof gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is Paul Offit he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people it'll save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right well it's good except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the whining and he actually says it that way so Paul's a terrorist when Paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school and why because Paul made a vaccine I don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have measles in this country now and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of measles what about polio let's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought it was a little strident no one's ever said that before she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today I don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning and he's flying to LAX right now he's over Ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours are going to rent a car and he's going to come to Long Beach and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with the paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning echinacea a little echinacea a little antioxidant to get you going I know you did because half of Americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that it's okay you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for a dark urine I'm totally with you dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well I think I understand we hate Big Pharma we hate big government we don't trust the man and we shouldn't our health care system sucks it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishing cold and soul deadening to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo that's fantastic I love big  bar but you know it's not it's it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and I have all sorts of little props here none of it ginko fraud Echinacea fraud akai I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it it's fraud and you know what when I say this stuff people scream at me and they say what do you care let people do what they want to do it's it's it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because I don't care if it's the Secretary of HHS who's saying hmm I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on my mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas when you start down the road where belief in magic replace evidence in science you end up in a place you don't want to be you end up in Tabo and Becky South Africa he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's a debate about words about metaphors its ideology it's not science every single thing we we grain of rice every sprig of parsley every brussel sprout has been modified by man you know there weren't tangerines in the Garden of Eden there wasn't any cantaloupe there weren't Christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years and some of it worked and some of it didn't we got rid of the stuff that didn't now we can do it in a more precise way and their risks absolutely but we can put something like vitamin A into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their lives you don't want to do that I have to say I don't understand it we object to genetically engineered food why do we do that well the things I constantly hear are too many chemicals pesticides hormones monoculture we don't want giant fields of the same thing that's wrong we don't want companies patenting life we don't want companies owning seeds and you know what my response to all of that is yes you're right let's fix it it's true we've got a huge food problem that this isn't science this has nothing to do with science its law its morality its patent stuff you know science isn't a company it's not a country it's not even an idea it's a process it's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid is really very deadening and it's preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70% more food than we do right now 70% this is investment in Africa over the last 30 years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we're not giving it to them and why genetically engineered food we don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance because I was something that half a billion people eat it's kind of like a potato it's just a bunch of calories it sucks it doesn't have nutrients it doesn't have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now and then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not they wouldn't starve and you know what that would be nice wouldn't be Chez Panisse but it would be nice and all I can say about this is why are we fighting it why I mean let's ask her such why are we fighting it because we don't want to move genes around this is about moving genes around it's not about chemicals it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food this isn't about rice crispies this is about keeping people alive and it's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don't if we continue to act the way we're actually we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of high-tech colonialism there's no other way to describe what's going on here it's selfish it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it so after this amazingly fun conversation you might want to say so you still want to go in this ridiculous time machine and go for it and absolutely absolutely I do it's stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it and we're going to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead we're going to be happy we do I know that we can and as far as I'm concerned that's something the world needs right now thank you you

[Music] let's pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool Teddy Sh'ma sheen and it's a time machine and everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and I wonder what you'd choose because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back I don't know they want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or American Idol I don't know I'm unconvinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and I understand that I'm not part of that crowd I have to say I don't want to go back and it's not because I'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so I want to get in the machine and I want to go

let people do what they want to do it's it's it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because I don't care if it's the Secretary of HHS who's saying hmm I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on my mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas when you start down the road where belief in magic replace evidence in science you end up in a place you don't want to be you end up in Tabo and Becky South Africa he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's a debate about words about metaphors its ideology it's not science every single thing we we grain of rice every sprig of parsley every brussel sprout has been modified by man you know there weren't tangerines in the Garden of Eden there wasn't any cantaloupe there weren't Christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years and some of it worked and some of it didn't we got rid of the stuff that didn't now we can do it in a more precise way and their risks absolutely but we can put something like vitamin A into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their lives you don't want to do that I have to say I don't understand it we object to genetically engineered food why do we do that well the things I constantly hear are too many chemicals pesticides hormones monoculture we don't want giant fields of the same thing that's wrong we don't want companies patenting life we don't want companies owning seeds and you know what my response to all of that is yes you're right let's fix it it's true we've got a huge food problem that this isn't science this has nothing to do with science its law its morality its patent stuff you know science isn't a company it's not a country it's not even an idea it's a process it's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid is really very deadening and it's preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70% more food than we do right now 70% this is investment in Africa over the last 30 years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we're not giving it to them and why genetically engineered food we don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance because I was something that half a billion people eat it's kind of like a potato it's just a bunch of calories it sucks it doesn't have nutrients it doesn't have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now and then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not they wouldn't starve and you know what that would be nice wouldn't be Chez Panisse but it would be nice and all I can say about this is why are we fighting it why I mean let's ask her such why are we fighting it because we don't want to move genes around this is about moving genes around it's not about chemicals it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food this isn't about rice crispies this is about keeping people alive and it's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don't if we continue to act the way we're actually we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of high-tech colonialism there's no other way to describe what's going on here it's selfish it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it so after this amazingly fun conversation you might want to say so you still want to go in this ridiculous time machine and go for it and absolutely absolutely I do it's stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it and we're going to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead we're going to be happy we do I know that we can and as far as I'm concerned that's something the world needs right now thank you you

**Transcript**:
[Music] let's pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool Teddy Sh'ma sheen and it's a time machine and everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and I wonder what you'd choose because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back I don't know they want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or American Idol I don't know I'm unconvinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and I understand that I'm not part of that crowd I have to say I don't want to go back and it's not because I'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so I want to get in the machine and I want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great-grandparents died all of them by the time they were 60 my grandparents push that number to 70 my parents are closing in on 80 so I there better be it there better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did a hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has it's gone it's vanished we vanquished it poof in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly diphtheria rubella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the News because there are some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all their accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's disgraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rain forests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away too so the question is can we do that and I I think we can I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it I really do believe that and know it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we battled Progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know what you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago I wrote a story about vaccines from The New Yorker a little story and I was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history I know what to do so I just did what I do I wrote a story and I moved on and soon after that I wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so I wrote a story about that too and I couldn't understand why people thought this was frankenfoods why they thought molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know I do what I do I wrote the story I moved on I mean I'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and I couldn't figure out why and eventually I did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it it just disturbed me so much but then I thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress okay there are reasons for that and I think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there there's no reason we shouldn't have you can just say a few names and people will understand Chernobyl Bhopal the Challenger Vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads I mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that I've never seen and hope never to see again about 12 years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles months in rubella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's Anna serious issue the data came back the data came back from the United States from England from Sweden from Canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe does we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and I do understand that I think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here's a fact the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible and what kind of what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now I understand it I do understand it because anyone have measles here does one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles doesn't happen very much doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King lives and they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero Jonas Salk he took one of the worst scourge of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio poof gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is Paul Offit he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people it'll save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right well it's good except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the whining and he actually says it that way so Paul's a terrorist when Paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school and why because Paul made a vaccine I don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have measles in this country now and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of measles what about polio let's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought it was a little strident no one's ever said that before she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today I don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning and he's flying to LAX right now he's over Ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours are going to rent a car and he's going to come to Long Beach and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with the paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning echinacea a little echinacea a little antioxidant to get you going I know you did because half of Americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that it's okay you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for a dark urine I'm totally with you dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well I think I understand we hate Big Pharma we hate big government we don't trust the man and we shouldn't our health care system sucks it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishing cold and soul deadening to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo that's fantastic I love big  bar but you know it's not it's it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and I have all sorts of little props here none of it ginko fraud Echinacea fraud akai I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it it's fraud and you know what when I say this stuff people scream at me and they say what do you care let people do what they want to do it's it's it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because I don't care if it's the Secretary of HHS who's saying hmm I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on my mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas when you start down the road where belief in magic replace evidence in science you end up

know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the News because there are some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all their accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's disgraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rain forests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away too so the question is can we do that and I I think we can I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it I really do believe that and know it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we battled Progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know what you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago I wrote a story about vaccines from The New Yorker a little story and I was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history I know what to do so I just did what I do I wrote a story and I moved on and soon after that I wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so I wrote a story about that too and I couldn't understand why people thought this was frankenfoods why they thought molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know I do what I do I wrote the story I moved on I mean I'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and I couldn't figure out why and eventually I did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it it just disturbed me so much but then I thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress okay there are reasons for that and I think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there there's no reason we shouldn't have you can just say a few names and people will understand Chernobyl Bhopal the Challenger Vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads I mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that I've never seen and hope never to see again about 12 years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles months in rubella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's Anna serious issue the data came back the data came back from the United States from England from Sweden from Canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe does we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and I do understand that I think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here's a fact the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible and what kind of what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now I understand it I do understand it because anyone have measles here does one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles doesn't happen very much doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King lives and they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero Jonas Salk he took one of the worst scourge of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio poof gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is Paul Offit he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people it'll save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right well it's good except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the whining and he actually says it that way so Paul's a terrorist when Paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school and why because Paul made a vaccine I don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have measles in this country now and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of measles what about polio let's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought it was a little strident no one's ever said that before she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today I don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning and he's flying to LAX right now he's over Ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours are going to rent a car and he's going to come to Long Beach and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with the paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning echinacea a little echinacea a little antioxidant to get you going I know you did because half of Americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that it's okay you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for a dark urine I'm totally with you dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well I think I understand we hate Big Pharma we hate big government we don't trust the man and we shouldn't our health care system sucks it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishing cold and soul deadening to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo that's fantastic I love big  bar but you know it's not it's it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and I have all sorts of little props here none of it ginko fraud Echinacea fraud akai I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it it's fraud and you know what when I say this stuff people scream at me and they say what do you care let people do what they want to do it's it's it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because I don't care if it's the Secretary of HHS who's saying hmm I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on my mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas when you start down the road where belief in magic replace evidence in science you end up in a place you don't want to be you end up in Tabo and Becky South Africa he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's a debate about words about metaphors its ideology it's not science every single thing we we grain of rice every sprig of parsley every brussel sprout has been modified by man you know there weren't tangerines in the Garden of Eden there wasn't any cantaloupe there weren't Christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years and some of it worked and some of it didn't we got rid of the stuff that didn't now we can do it in a more precise way and their risks absolutely but we can put something like vitamin A into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their lives you don't want to do that I have to say I don't understand it we object to genetically engineered food why do we do that well the things I constantly hear are too many chemicals pesticides hormones monoculture we don't want giant fields of the same thing that's wrong we don't want companies patenting life we don't want companies owning seeds and you know what my response to all of that is yes you're right let's fix it it's true we've got a huge food problem that this isn't science this has nothing to do with science its law its morality its patent stuff you know science isn't a company it's not a country it's not even an idea it's a process it's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid is really very deadening and it's preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70% more food than we do right now 70% this is investment in Africa over the last 30 years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we're not giving it to them and why genetically engineered food we don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance because I was something that half a billion people eat it's kind of like a potato it's just a bunch of calories it sucks it doesn't have nutrients it doesn't have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now and then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not they wouldn't starve and you know what that would be nice wouldn't be Chez Panisse but it would be nice and all I can say about this is why are we fighting it why I mean let's ask her such why are we fighting it because we don't want to move genes around this is about moving genes around it's not about chemicals it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food this isn't about rice crispies this is about keeping people alive and it's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don't if we continue to act the way we're actually we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of high-tech colonialism there's no other way to describe what's going on here it's selfish it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it so after this amazingly fun conversation you might want to say so you still want to go in this ridiculous time machine and go for it and absolutely absolutely I do it's stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it and we're going to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead we're going to be happy we do I know that we can and as far as I'm concerned that's something the world needs right now thank you you

[Music] let's pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool Teddy Sh'ma sheen and it's a time machine and everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and I wonder what you'd choose because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back I don't know they want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or American Idol I don't know I'm unconvinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and I understand that I'm not part of that crowd I have to say I don't want to go back and it's not because I'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so I want to get in the machine and I want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great-grandparents died all of them by the time they were 60 my grandparents push that number to 70 my parents are closing in on 80 so I there better be it there better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did a hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has it's gone it's vanished we vanquished it poof in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly diphtheria rubella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the News because there are some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all their accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's disgraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rain forests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away too so the question is can we do that and I I think we can I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it I really do believe that and know it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we battled Progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know what you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own

a few names and people will understand Chernobyl Bhopal the Challenger Vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads I mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that I've never seen and hope never to see again about 12 years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles months in rubella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of

strident no one's ever said that before she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today I don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning and he's flying to LAX right now he's over Ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours are going to rent a car and he's going to come to Long Beach and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with the paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning echinacea a little echinacea a little antioxidant to get you going I know you did because half of Americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that it's okay you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for a dark urine I'm totally with you dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well I think I understand we hate Big Pharma we hate big government we don't trust the man and we shouldn't our health care system sucks it's cruel to millions

evidence of my experts on my mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas when you start down the road where belief in magic replace evidence in science you end up in a place you don't want to be you end up in Tabo and Becky South Africa he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's a debate about words about metaphors its ideology it's not science every single thing we we grain of rice every sprig of parsley every

why are we fighting it because we don't want to move genes around this is about moving genes around it's not about chemicals it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food this isn't about rice crispies this is about keeping people alive and it's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don't if we continue to act the way we're actually we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of high-tech colonialism there's no other way to describe what's going on here it's selfish it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it so after this amazingly fun conversation you might want to say so you still want to go in this ridiculous time machine and go for it and absolutely absolutely I do it's stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it and we're going to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead we're going to be happy we do I know that we can and as far as I'm concerned that's something the world needs right now thank you you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: What is the speaker's opinion on the role of science in addressing the world's problems?**

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match is not available among the generated MCQs.

But if we look at the options of Question 3, we can see that option C mentions "The speaker believes that science has the power to solve many of the world's problems, but it needs to be used responsibly." This option implies that science is a process or a tool that can be used to solve problems.

A more direct match would be a generated MCQ that asks "How does the speaker define science?" or "What is the speaker's view on the nature of science?" with options that include "A process".

Unfortunately, such a direct match is not available among the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose:

**None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose, I would say Question 3 is the closest match.**

If I really had to provide an index, I would say: **3** (with the caveat that it's not a direct match)

[Music] [Applause] now I wanted to start with the question when was the last time you were called childish for kids like me being called childish can be a frequent occurrence every time we make irrational demands exhibit irresponsible behavior or display any other signs of being normal American citizens we are called childish which really bothers me after all take a look at these events imperialism and colonization world wars george w bush ask yourself who's responsible adults now what have kids done bull and Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust ruby bridges helped to end segregation in the United States and most recently Charlie Simpson helped to raise one hundred and twenty thousand pounds for Haiti on his little bike so as you can see evidence by such examples age has absolutely nothing to do with it the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking thank you then again who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs maybe you've had grand plans before but stopped yourself thinking the that's impossible or that costs too much or that won't benefit me for better or worse sweet kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thing about reasons why not to do things kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were free kind of utopia how many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals can be a burden because you know that if everything were free then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and leaped chaos on the other hand we kids still dream about perfection and that's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality you have to dream about it first in many ways our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the Museum of Glass in Tacoma Washington my home state yoo-hoo Washington has a program called kids design glass and kids draw their own ideas for glass art now the resident artist said that they got some of their best ideas from the program because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass and the certain shapes they just think of good ideas now when you think of glass you might think of colorful shmuly designs or maybe Italian vases but kids challenge glass ours to go beyond that into the realm of broken-hearted snakes and bacon boys who you can see as meat vision now our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insiders knowledge kids already do a lot of learning from adults and we have a lot to share I think that adults should start learning from kids now I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd teachers and students and I like this analogy it shouldn't just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students to do this do that the students should teach their teachers learning between grownups and kids should be reciprocal the reality unfortunately is a little different and it has a lot to do with trust or a lack of it now if you don't trust someone you place restrictions on them right if I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the 10% interest she established on her last loan I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back true story by the way now adults seem to have adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every don't do that don't do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use as history points out regimes become pressive when they're fearful about keeping control and although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes kids have no or very little saying making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population now it's kind of worse and restriction is the adults often underestimate kids abilities we love challenges but when expectations are low trust me we will sing to them my own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister okay so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ fighters when lots of other kids were hearing the wheels on the bus go round and round well we heard that one too but pioneer germ Fighters totally rules I love to write from the age of four and when I was six my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word thank you Bill Gates and thank you mom I wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop and I wanted to get published instead of just scoffing at this heresy that kid when to get published or saying wait until you're older my parents were really supportive many publishers were not quite so encouraging one large children's publisher ironically saying they didn't work with children might want to children's publisher not work with children I don't know you kind of alienating large there now one publisher action publishing was willing to take that leap and trust me and to listen to what I had to say they published my first book flying fingers you see it here and from there on it's gone speaking at hundreds of schools keynote and the thousands of educators and finally today speaking to you I appreciate your attention today because to show that you truly care you listen but there's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults kids grow up and become adults just like you or just like you really the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult but rather better adults than you have been which may be a little challenge and consider your guys credentials but the way progress happens is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones it's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore no matter your position or place in life it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away adults and fellow tedsters you need to listen and learn from kids and trust us and expect more from us you must lend an ear today because we are the leaders of tomorrow which means we're gonna be taking care of you and your old and son Isle no just kidding actually um no really we are going to be the next generation the one who will bring this world forward and in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you remember that cloning is possible and that involves going to childhood again in which case you'll want to be heard just like my generation now the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas kids need opportunities to lead and succeed are you ready to make the match because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom thank you you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what is unique about the TED speaker, and the correct answer is that she is twelve years old. While none of the generated MCQs ask about the speaker's age, Question 6 asks about the publisher of the speaker's first book, "Flying Fingers", which is related to the speaker's background and achievements.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content, I would suggest Question 7. This question asks about the goal of education, which is related to the speaker's message and perspective as a young person. The correct answer to this question is that the goal of education is to turn children into better adults than the current generation, which is a theme that is present in the speaker's talk.

But since the question is asking about the speaker, I would say that none of the questions are a good match.

If I really had to choose I would say: Question 8.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 4 does not match the ground truth MCQ's options and content exactly, I will provide an explanation for my choice.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the speaker's opinion on when children are called "childish". Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest in terms of question intent, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ's options and content.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would suggest generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ's intent, options, and content.

That being said, if I had to choose one from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, despite its limitations.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 1: According to the speaker, what is the problem with the word "childish"?**

Although the options in Question 1 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the question intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks why the word "childish" should be abolished, and Question 1 asks about the problem with the word "childish". The correct answer to the ground truth MCQ is that the traits the word "childish" addresses are seen so often in adults, which is related to the idea that the word "childish" is problematic because it is age-discriminatory.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 1.

[Music] [Applause] now I wanted to start with the question when was the last time you were called childish for kids like me being called childish can be a frequent occurrence every time we make irrational demands exhibit irresponsible behavior or display any other signs of being normal American citizens we are called childish which really bothers me after all take a look at these events imperialism and colonization world wars george w bush ask yourself who's responsible adults now what have kids done bull and Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust ruby bridges helped to end segregation in the United States and most recently Charlie Simpson helped to raise one hundred and twenty thousand pounds for Haiti on his little bike so as you can see evidence by such examples age has absolutely nothing to do with it the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking thank you then again who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs maybe you've had grand plans before but stopped yourself thinking the that's impossible or that costs too much or that won't benefit me for better or worse sweet kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thing about reasons why not to do things kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were free kind of utopia how many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals can be a burden because you know that if everything were free then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and leaped chaos on the other hand we kids still dream about perfection and that's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality you have to dream about it first in many ways our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the Museum of Glass in Tacoma Washington my home state yoo-hoo Washington has a program called kids design glass and kids draw their own ideas for glass art now the resident artist said that they got some of their best ideas from the program because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass and the certain shapes they just think of good ideas now when you think of glass you might think of colorful shmuly designs or maybe Italian vases but kids challenge glass ours to go beyond that into the realm of broken-hearted snakes and bacon boys who you can see as meat vision now our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insiders knowledge kids already do a lot of learning from adults and we have a lot to share I think that adults should start learning from kids now I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd teachers and students and I like this analogy it shouldn't just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students to do this do that the students should teach their teachers learning between grownups and kids should be reciprocal the reality unfortunately is a little different and it has a lot to do with trust or a lack of it now if you don't trust someone you place restrictions on them right if I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the 10% interest she established on her last loan I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back true story by the way now adults seem to have adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every don't do that don't do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use as history points out regimes become pressive when they're fearful about keeping control and although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes kids have no or very little saying making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population now it's kind of worse and restriction is the adults often underestimate kids abilities we love challenges but when expectations are low trust me we will sing to them my own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister okay so they

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks why Adora thinks it's still a good thing that kids dream of perfection. The correct option is "You have to dream about something first in order for it to become a reality."

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 has a similar intent, but it's not a perfect match. However, I found that Question 5 is the closest match, as it asks about the speaker's opinion on encouraging children to express themselves and take risks, which is related to the idea of dreaming big and making things a reality.

But a more suitable match can be found in the options of the other questions. 

A more suitable match is not present, however Question 8 can be considered the most similar, as it has the same intent of the speaker's opinion on the children's actions.

Therefore, I would recommend Question 8 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it's not a perfect match.

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about an event that occurred when the speaker was 6 years old, and the generated MCQ 6 asks about the publisher of the speaker's first book, which is mentioned in the context of the speaker's childhood and writing experiences.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 6, but I would like to note that it would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ.

didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ fighters when lots of other kids were hearing the wheels on the bus go round and round well we heard that one too but pioneer germ Fighters totally rules I love to write from the age of four and when I was six my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word thank you Bill Gates and thank you mom I wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop and I wanted to get published instead of just scoffing at this heresy that kid when to get published or saying wait until you're older my parents were really supportive many publishers were not quite so encouraging one large children's publisher ironically saying they didn't work with children might want to children's publisher not work with children I don't know you kind of alienating large there now one publisher action publishing was willing to take that leap and trust me and to listen to what I had to say they published my first book flying fingers you see it here and from there on it's gone speaking at hundreds of schools keynote and the thousands of educators and finally today speaking to you I appreciate your attention today because to show that you truly care you listen but there's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults kids grow up and become adults just like you or just like you really the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult but rather better adults than you have been which may be a little challenge and consider your guys credentials but the way progress happens is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones it's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore no matter your position or place in life it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away adults and fellow tedsters you need to listen and learn from kids and trust us and expect more from us you must lend an ear today because we are the leaders of tomorrow which means we're gonna be taking care of you and your old and son Isle no just kidding actually um no really we are going to be the next generation the one who will bring this world forward and in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you remember that cloning is possible and that involves going to childhood again in which case you'll want to be heard just like my generation now the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas kids need opportunities to lead and succeed are you ready to make the match because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom thank you you

**Transcript**:
and I got my current job I was given a good piece of advice which was to interview three politicians every day and from that much contact with politicians I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another they have what I call logorrhea dementia which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane but what they do have is incredible social skills when you meet them they lock into you they look you in the eye they invade your personal space they massage the back of your head I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal squeezing it I once this was years ago I saw a Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate and they were friends and they hugged each other and they were laughing and their faces were like this far apart and they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other and I was like get a room I don't want to see this but they have those social skills at another case last election cycle I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons bit chip rip zip lip and dip and and he's going into a diner and he goes to the diner introduce himself to a family and says what village are you from in New Hampshire and then he described the home he owned in their village and then he so he goes around the room and then as he's leaving the diner he first names almost everybody he's just met I was like okay that's social skill but the paradox is when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode that social awareness vanishes and they tart talking about like accountants so in the course of my career I've covered a series of failures we sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up and what they really lacked was social trust we invaded Iraq with the military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities we had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn't do anything stupid for 30 years I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureau edek boxes charters private schools vouchers but we've had disappointing results year after year and the fact is people learn from people they love and if you're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student you're not talking about that reality but that reality is expunged from our policymaking process and so that's led to a question for me why are the most socially attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy and I came to the conclusion this is a symptom of a larger problem that for centuries we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that were divided selves that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions and it's led to a view of human nature that were rational individuals who respond and straightforward ways to incentives and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is and it's produced a great amputation a shallow view of human nature we're really good at talking about material things but we're really bad at talking about emotions we're really good at talking about skills and safety and health were really bad at talking about character Allister McIntyre the famous philosopher said that we have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue on or goodness but we no longer have a system by which to connect them and so this has led to a shallow path and politics but also in a whole range of human endeavors you can see it in the way we raise our young kids you go to an elementary school at 3:00 in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out and they're wearing these eighty pound backpacks that if the wind blows them over they're like beetles stuck there on the ground you see these cars that drive up usually it's sobs and Audi's in Volvo's because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car so long as it comes from a country hostile to US foreign policy that's fine they get picked up by these creatures I've called uber moms who are highly successful career women who've taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard and you can usually tell the uber moms because they actually weigh less than their own children so at the moment of conception they're doing little butt exercises the babies plop out they're flashing Mandarin flashcards with the things driving them home and they wanted to be enlightened so they take them to Ben & Jerry's ice cream company with its own foreign policy and one of my books I joke that Ben and Jerry's should make a passive his toothpaste doesn't kill germs just ask them to leave be a big seller and then they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula and you know Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International they buy we buy these seaweed based snacks they're called veggie booty with kale which is their kids at home home and say mom mom I want to snack that a whole prevent colon rectal cancer and so the kids are raised in a certain way jumping through achievement hopes are the things we can measure SAT prep OBO soccer practice they get into competitive colleges they get good jobs and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a superficial manner and they make a ton of money and sometimes you can see them at vacation places like Jackson Hole or Aspen and they're they've become elegant and slender they don't really have thighs they just have one elegant calf on top of another they have kids of their own and they've sort of achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people so their grand moms look like Gertrude Stein their daughters look like Halle Berry I don't know how they've done that they get there and they realize that they it's fashionable now to have dogs 1/3 as tall as your ceiling heights so they've got these furries 160 pound dogs look like velociraptors all named after Jane Austen characters and then when they get old they haven't really developed a philosophy of life but they've decided that I've been successful at everything I'm just not going to die and so they hire personal trainers they're popping cialis like breath mints you see them on the mountains up there they're cross-country ski up the mountain with these grim expressions that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis and sort of as they whizzed by you it's like being passed by a little iron raisinet going up the hill and so this is part of what life is but it's not all of what life is and over the past few years I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are and it's not based on theology or philosophy it's in the study of the mind across all these spheres of research from neuroscience the cognitive science behavioral economists psychologists sociology we're developing a revolution in consciousness and when you synthesize it all it's giving us a new view of human nature and far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature it's a new humanism it's a new enchantment and I think when you synthesize this research you start with three key insights the first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species the unconscious mind does most of the work and so one way to formulate that assists the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute of which can be consciously aware of about 40 and this leads to oddities one of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists people named Lawrence become lawyers because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar which is why I've named my daughter President of the United States Brooks another finding is that the unconscious far from being dumb and sexualized it's actually quite smart so one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture it's really hard to imagine a sofa how it's gonna look in your house and the way you should do that is sort of study the furniture let it marinate in your mind distract yourself and then a few days later go with your gut because unconsciously you've figured it out the second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking people with strokes and lesions in the emotion processing parts of the brain are not super smart they're actually quite sometimes quite helpless and the giant in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning Antonio Damasio and one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value and so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom now I'm a middle-aged guy I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions one of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys they put him into a brain scan machine this is apocryphal by the way but I don't care and it and they have them watch a horror movie and then they had some them describe their feelings toward their wives and the the brain scans were identical in both activities it was just sheer terror so me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony but it is the central organizing process of the way we think it tells us what to imprint a brain is the record of the feelings of a life and the third insight is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals we're social animals not rational animals we emerge out of relationships and we are deeply interpenetrated one with another and so when we see another person we reenact on our own minds what we see in their minds when we watch a car chase in a movie we it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase when we watch pornography it's a little like having sex though probably not as good and you see this in when lovers walk down the street when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion the deep interpenetrate and this revolution and who we are gives us a different way of seeing I think politics a different way most importantly of seeing human capital we are now children of the French enlightenment we believe that reason is the highest of the faculties but I think this research shows that the British enlightenment of the Scottish enlightenment with David Hume Adam Smith actually had a better handle on who we are that reason is often weak our sentiments are strong and our sentiments are often trustworthy and this works corrects that bias in our culture that dehumanizing bias it gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life when we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily things like grades SATs degrees the number of year and for schooling what it really takes to do well to leave a meaningful life are things that are deeper things we don't really even have words for and so let me list just a couple of things I think this research points us toward trying to understand the first gift our talent is mind-sight the ability to enter into other people's minds and learn what they have to offer babies come with this ability meltzoff who's at the University of Washington leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old he wagged his tongue at the baby the baby wagged her tongue back babies are born two interpenetrating two moms minds and to download what they find they're models of how to understand reality in the United States fifty-five percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people and those people have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict was 77 percent accuracy at age 18 months who was gonna graduate from high school based on who had good attachment with mom 20 percent of kids do not have those relationships they are what we call avoidant lis attached they have trouble relating to other people they go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind wanting to get close to people but not really having models of how to do that and so this is one skill of how to Hoover up knowledge one from another a second skill is equipoise the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind so for example we are overconfidence machines 95% of our professors report that they are above average teachers 96% of college students say they have above-average social skills Time magazine asked Americans are you in the top 1% of earners 19% of Americans are in the top 1% this is a gender linked trait by the way men drown at twice the rate as women because men think they can swim across that lake but some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases their own overconfidence they have a pistola logical modesty they are open-minded in the face of ambiguity they are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence they are curious and these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ the third trade is Metis what we might call street smarts it's a Greek word it's a sensitivity to the physical environment the ability to pick out patterns in an environment derive a gist one of my colleagues at The Times did a great story about soldiers in Iraq who could look down the street and detect somehow whether there was an ie D Al and mind in the street they couldn't tell you how they did it but they could feel cold they felt a coldness and they were more often right than wrong the third is what might call sympathy the ability to work within groups and that comes in tremendously handy because groups are smarter than individuals and face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically because 90% of our communication is nonverbal and the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group it's determined by how well they communicate how often they take terms and conversations then you could talk about it Oh trait like blending any child can say I'm a tiger pretend to be a tiger it seems so Elementary but in fact it's phenomenally complicated to take a concept I and a concept tiger and them together but this is the source of innovation what Picasso did for example was take the concept western art and the concept African masks and blend them together not only the geometry but the moral systems entailed in them and these are skills again we can't count and measure and then the final thing I'll mention is something you might call limerence and this is not an ability it's a drive and a motivation the conscious mind hungers for success and prestige the unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task when a craftsman feels lost in his craft when a naturalist feels at one with nature when a believer feels at one with God's love that is what the unconscious mind hungers for and many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused and one of the most beautiful description I've come across in this research of how Minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named Douglas Hofstadter's at the University of Indiana he was married to a woman named Carol and made a wonderful relationship when their kids were five and two Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly and Hofstadter wrote a book called I am a strange loop in the course of that book he describes a moment just months after Carol has died he comes across her picture on the mantle or on a bureau in his bedroom and here's what he wrote I looked at her face and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes and all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed that's me that's me and those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before about the fusion of our souls into one higher-level entity about the fact that the core of both our souls they are identical hopes and dreams for our children about the notion that those hopes were not separate and distinct hopes but were just one hope one clear thing that defined us both that welded us into a unit the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children I realized that though Carol had died that core piece of her had not died at all but had it lived on very determinately in my brain the Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom through his suffering Hofstetter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are through the policy failures of last 30 years we have come to acknowledge I think how shallow our view of human nature has been and now as we confront that challenge us and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are comes this revolution in consciousness these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted this new humanism and when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious it had a vast effect on the climate of the times now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious of who we are deep inside and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture thank you

it's not based on theology or philosophy it's in the study of the mind across all these spheres of research from neuroscience the cognitive science behavioral economists psychologists sociology we're developing a revolution in consciousness and when you synthesize it all it's giving us a new view of human nature and far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature it's a new humanism it's a new enchantment and I think when you synthesize this research you start with three key insights the first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species the unconscious mind does most of the work and so one way to formulate that assists the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute of which can be consciously aware of about 40 and this leads to oddities one of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists people named Lawrence become lawyers because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar which is why I've named my daughter President of the United States Brooks another finding is that the unconscious far from being dumb and sexualized it's actually quite smart so one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture it's really hard to imagine a sofa how it's gonna look in your house and the way you should do that is sort of study the furniture let it marinate in your mind distract yourself and then a few days later go with your gut because unconsciously you've figured it out the second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking people with strokes and lesions in the emotion processing parts of the brain are not super smart they're actually quite sometimes quite helpless and the giant in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning Antonio Damasio and one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value and so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom now I'm a middle-aged guy I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions one of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys they put him into a brain scan machine this is apocryphal by the way but I don't care and it and they have them watch a horror movie and then they had some them describe their feelings toward their wives and the the brain scans were identical in both activities it was just sheer terror so me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony but it is the central organizing process of the way we think it tells us what to imprint a brain is the record of the feelings of a life and the third insight is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals we're social animals not rational animals we emerge out of relationships and we are deeply interpenetrated one with another and so when we see another person we reenact on our own minds what we see in their minds when we watch a car chase in a movie we it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase when we watch pornography it's a little like having sex though probably not as good and you see this in when lovers walk down the street when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion the deep interpenetrate and this revolution and who we are gives us a different way of seeing I think politics a different way most importantly of seeing human capital we are now children of the French enlightenment we believe that reason is the highest of the faculties but I think this research shows that the British enlightenment of the Scottish enlightenment with David Hume Adam Smith actually had a better handle on who we are that reason is often weak our sentiments are strong and our sentiments are often trustworthy and this works corrects that bias in our culture that dehumanizing bias it gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life when we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily things like grades SATs degrees the number of year and for schooling what it really takes to do well to leave a meaningful life are things that are deeper things we don't really even have words for and so let me list just a couple of things I think this research points us toward trying to understand the first gift our talent is mind-sight the ability to enter into other people's minds and learn what they have to offer babies come with this ability meltzoff who's at the University of Washington leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old he wagged his tongue at the baby the baby wagged her tongue back babies are born two interpenetrating two moms minds and to download what they find they're models of how to understand reality in the United States fifty-five percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people and those people have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict was 77 percent accuracy at age 18 months who was gonna graduate from high school based on who had good attachment with mom 20 percent of kids do not have those relationships they are what we call avoidant lis attached they have trouble relating to other people they go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind wanting to get close to people but not really having models of how to do that and so this is one skill of how to Hoover up knowledge one from another a second skill is equipoise the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind so for example we are overconfidence machines 95% of our professors report that they are above average teachers 96% of college students say they have above-average social skills Time magazine asked Americans are you in the top 1% of earners 19% of Americans are in the top 1% this is a gender linked trait by the way men drown at twice the rate as women because men think they can swim across that lake but some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases their own overconfidence they have a pistola logical modesty they are open-minded in the face of ambiguity they are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence they are curious and these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ the third trade is Metis what we might call street smarts it's a Greek word it's a sensitivity to the physical environment the ability to pick out patterns in an environment derive a gist one of my colleagues at The Times did a great story about soldiers in Iraq who could look down the street and detect somehow whether there was an ie D Al and mind in the street they couldn't tell you how they did it but they could feel cold they felt a coldness and they were more often right than wrong the third is what might call sympathy the ability to work within groups and that comes in tremendously handy because groups are smarter than individuals and face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically because 90% of our communication is nonverbal and the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group it's determined by how well they communicate how often they take terms and conversations then you could talk about it Oh trait like blending any child can say I'm a tiger pretend to be a tiger it seems so Elementary but in fact it's phenomenally complicated to take a concept I and a concept tiger and them together but this is the source of innovation what Picasso did for example was take the concept western art and the concept African masks and blend them together not only the geometry but the moral systems entailed in them and these are skills again we can't count and measure and then the final thing I'll mention is something you might call limerence and this is not an ability it's a drive and a motivation the conscious mind hungers for success and prestige the unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task when a craftsman feels lost in his craft when a naturalist feels at one with nature when a believer feels at one with God's love that is what the unconscious mind hungers for and many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused and one of the most beautiful description I've come across in this research of how Minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named Douglas Hofstadter's at the University of Indiana he was married to a woman named Carol and made a wonderful relationship when their kids were five and two Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly and Hofstadter wrote a book called I am a strange loop in the course of that book he describes a moment just months after Carol has died he comes across her picture on the mantle or on a bureau in his bedroom and here's what he wrote I looked at her face and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes and all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed that's me that's me and those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before about the fusion of our souls into one higher-level entity about the fact that the core of both our souls they are identical hopes and dreams for our children about the notion that those hopes were not separate and distinct hopes but were just one hope one clear thing that defined us both that welded us into a unit the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children I realized that though Carol had died that core piece of her had not died at all but had it lived on very determinately in my brain the Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom through his suffering Hofstetter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are through the policy failures of last 30 years we have come to acknowledge I think how shallow our view of human nature has been and now as we confront that challenge us and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are comes this revolution in consciousness these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted this new humanism and when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious it had a vast effect on the climate of the times now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious of who we are deep inside and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture thank you

**Transcript**:
and I got my current job I was given a good piece of advice which was to interview three politicians every day and from that much contact with politicians I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another they have what I call logorrhea dementia which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane but what they do have is incredible social skills when you meet them they lock into you they look you in the eye they invade your personal space they massage the back of your head I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal squeezing it I once this was years ago I saw a Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate and they were friends and they hugged each other and they were laughing and their faces were like this far apart and they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other and I was like get a room I don't want to see this but they have those social skills at another case last election cycle I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons bit chip rip zip lip and dip and and he's going into a diner and he goes to the diner introduce himself to a family and says what village are you from in New Hampshire and then he described the home he owned in their village and then he so he goes around the room and then as he's leaving the diner he first names almost everybody he's just met I was like okay that's social skill but the paradox is when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode that social awareness vanishes and they tart talking about like accountants so in the course of my career I've covered a series of failures we sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up and what they really lacked was social trust we invaded Iraq with the military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities we had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn't do anything stupid for 30 years I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureau edek boxes charters private schools vouchers but we've had disappointing results year after year and the fact is people learn from people they love and if you're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student you're not talking about that reality but that reality is expunged from our policymaking process and so that's led to a question for me why are the most socially attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy and I came to the conclusion this is a symptom of a larger problem that for centuries we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that were divided selves that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions and it's led to a view of human nature that were rational individuals who respond and straightforward ways to incentives and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is and it's produced a great amputation a shallow view of human nature we're really good at talking about material things but we're really bad at talking about emotions we're really good at talking about skills and safety and health were really bad at talking about character Allister McIntyre the famous philosopher said that we have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue on or goodness but we no longer have a system by which to connect them and so this has led to a shallow path and politics but also in a whole range of human endeavors you can see it in the way we raise our young kids you go to an elementary school at 3:00 in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out and they're wearing these eighty pound backpacks that if the wind blows them over they're like beetles stuck there on the ground you see these cars that drive up usually it's sobs and Audi's in Volvo's because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car so long as it comes from a country hostile to US foreign policy that's fine they get picked up by these creatures I've called uber moms who are highly successful career women who've taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard and you can usually tell the uber moms because they actually weigh less than their own children so at the moment of conception they're doing little butt exercises the babies plop out they're flashing Mandarin flashcards with the things driving them home and they wanted to be enlightened so they take them to Ben & Jerry's ice cream company with its own foreign policy and one of my books I joke that Ben and Jerry's should make a passive his toothpaste doesn't kill germs just ask them to leave be a big seller and then they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula and you know Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International they buy we buy these seaweed based snacks they're called veggie booty with kale which is their kids at home home and say mom mom I want to snack that a whole prevent colon rectal cancer and so the kids are raised in a certain way jumping through achievement hopes are the things we can measure SAT prep OBO soccer practice they get into competitive colleges they get good jobs and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a superficial manner and they make a ton of money and sometimes you can see them at vacation places like Jackson Hole or Aspen and they're they've become elegant and slender they don't really have thighs they just have one elegant calf on top of another they have kids of their own and they've sort of achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people so their grand moms look like Gertrude Stein their daughters look like Halle Berry I don't know how they've done that they get there and they realize that they it's fashionable now to have dogs 1/3 as tall as your ceiling heights so they've got these furries 160 pound dogs look like velociraptors all named after Jane Austen characters and then when they get old they haven't really developed a philosophy of life but they've decided that I've been successful at everything I'm just not going to die and so they hire personal trainers they're popping cialis like breath mints you see them on the mountains up there they're cross-country ski up the mountain with these grim expressions that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis and sort of as they whizzed by you it's like being passed by a little iron raisinet going up the hill and so this is part of what life is but it's not all of what life is and over the past few years I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are and it's not based on theology or philosophy it's in the study of the mind across all these spheres of research from neuroscience the cognitive science behavioral economists psychologists sociology we're

edek boxes charters private schools vouchers but we've had disappointing results year after year and the fact is people learn from people they love and if you're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student you're not talking about that reality but that reality is expunged from our policymaking process and so that's led to a question for me why are the most socially attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy and I came to the conclusion this is a symptom of a larger problem that for centuries we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that were divided selves that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions and it's led to a view of human nature that were rational individuals who respond and straightforward ways to incentives and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is and it's produced a great amputation a shallow view of human nature we're really good at talking about material things but we're really bad at talking about emotions we're really good at talking about skills and safety and health were really bad at talking about character Allister McIntyre the famous philosopher said that we have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue on or goodness but we no longer have a system by which to connect them and so this has led to a shallow path and politics but also in a whole range of human endeavors you can see it in the way we raise our young kids you go to an elementary school at 3:00 in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out and they're wearing these eighty pound backpacks that if the wind blows them over they're like beetles stuck there on the ground you see these cars that drive up usually it's sobs and Audi's in Volvo's because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car so long as it comes from a country hostile to US foreign policy that's fine they get picked up by these creatures I've called uber moms who are highly successful career women who've taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard and you can usually tell the uber moms because they actually weigh less than their own children so at the moment of conception they're doing little butt exercises the babies plop out they're flashing Mandarin flashcards with the things driving them home and they wanted to be enlightened so they take them to Ben & Jerry's ice cream company with its own foreign policy and one of my books I joke that Ben and Jerry's should make a passive his toothpaste doesn't kill germs just ask them to leave be a big seller and then they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula and you know Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International they buy we buy these seaweed based snacks they're called veggie booty with kale which is their kids at home home and say mom mom I want to snack that a whole prevent colon rectal cancer and so the kids are raised in a certain way jumping through achievement hopes are the things we can measure SAT prep OBO soccer practice they get into competitive colleges they get good jobs and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a superficial manner and they make a ton of money and sometimes you can see them at vacation places like Jackson Hole or Aspen and they're they've become elegant and slender they don't really have thighs they just have one elegant calf on top of another they have kids of their own and they've sort of achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people so their grand moms look like Gertrude Stein their daughters look like Halle Berry I don't know how they've done that they get there and they realize that they it's fashionable now to have dogs 1/3 as tall as your ceiling heights so they've got these furries 160 pound dogs look like velociraptors all named after Jane Austen characters and then when they get old they haven't really developed a philosophy of life but they've decided that I've been successful at everything I'm just not going to die and so they hire personal trainers they're popping cialis like breath mints you see them on the mountains up there they're cross-country ski up the mountain with these grim expressions that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis and sort of as they whizzed by you it's like being passed by a little iron raisinet going up the hill and so this is part of what life is but it's not all of what life is and over the past few years I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are and it's not based on theology or philosophy it's in the study of the mind across all these spheres of research from neuroscience the cognitive science behavioral economists psychologists sociology we're developing a revolution in consciousness and when you synthesize it all it's giving us a new view of human nature and far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature it's a new humanism it's a new enchantment and I think when you synthesize this research you start with three key insights the first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species the unconscious mind does most of the work and so one way to formulate that assists the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute of which can be consciously aware of about 40 and this leads to oddities one of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists people named Lawrence become lawyers because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar which is why I've named my daughter President of the United States Brooks another finding is that the unconscious far from being dumb and sexualized it's actually quite smart so one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture it's really hard to imagine a sofa how it's gonna look in your house and the way you should do that is sort of study the furniture let it marinate in your mind distract yourself and then a few days later go with your gut because unconsciously you've figured it out the second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking people with strokes and lesions in the emotion processing parts of the brain are not super smart they're actually quite sometimes quite helpless and the giant in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning Antonio Damasio and one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value and so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom now I'm a middle-aged guy I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions one of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys they put him into a brain scan machine this is apocryphal by the way but I don't care and it and they have them watch a horror movie and then they had some them describe their feelings toward their wives and the the brain scans were identical in both activities it was just sheer terror so me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony but it is the central organizing process of the way we think it tells us what to imprint a brain is the record of the feelings of a life and the third insight is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals we're social animals not rational animals we emerge out of relationships and we are deeply interpenetrated one with another and so when we see another person we reenact on our own minds what we see in their minds when we watch a car chase in a movie we it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase when we watch pornography it's a little like having sex though probably not as good and you see this in when lovers walk down the street when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion the deep interpenetrate and this revolution and who we are gives us a different way of seeing I think politics a different way most importantly of seeing human capital we are now children of the French enlightenment we believe that reason is the highest of the faculties but I think this research shows that the British enlightenment of the Scottish enlightenment with David Hume Adam Smith actually had a better handle on who we are that reason is often weak our sentiments are strong and our sentiments are often trustworthy and this works corrects that bias in our culture that dehumanizing bias it gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life when we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily things like grades SATs degrees the number of year and for schooling what it really takes to do well to leave a meaningful life are things that are deeper things we don't really even have words for and so let me list just a couple of things I think this research points us toward trying to understand the first gift our talent is mind-sight the ability to enter into other people's minds and learn what they have to offer babies come with this ability meltzoff who's at the University of Washington leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old he wagged his tongue at the baby the baby wagged her tongue back babies are born two interpenetrating two moms minds and to download what they find they're models of how to understand reality in the United States fifty-five percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people and those people have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict was 77 percent accuracy at age 18 months who was gonna graduate from high school based on who had good attachment with mom 20 percent of kids do not have those relationships they are what we call avoidant lis attached they have trouble relating to other people they go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind wanting to get close to people but not really having models of how to do that and so this is one skill of how to Hoover up knowledge one from another a second skill is equipoise the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind so for example we are overconfidence machines 95% of our professors report that they are above average teachers 96% of college students say they have above-average social skills Time magazine asked Americans are you in the top 1% of earners 19% of Americans are in the top 1% this is a gender linked trait by the way men drown at twice the rate as women because men think they can swim across that lake but some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases their own overconfidence they have a pistola logical modesty they are open-minded in the face of ambiguity they are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence they are curious and these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ the third trade is Metis what we might call street smarts it's a Greek word it's a sensitivity to the physical environment the ability to pick out patterns in an environment derive a gist one of my colleagues at The Times did a great story about soldiers in Iraq who could look down the street and detect somehow whether there was an ie D Al and mind in the street they couldn't tell you how they did it but they could feel cold they felt a coldness and they were more often right than wrong the third is what might call sympathy the ability to work within groups and that comes in tremendously handy because groups are smarter than individuals and face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically because 90% of our communication is nonverbal and the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group it's determined by how well they communicate how often they take terms and conversations then you could talk about it Oh trait like blending any child can say I'm a tiger pretend to be a tiger it seems so Elementary but in fact it's phenomenally complicated to take a concept I and a concept tiger and them together but this is the source of innovation what Picasso did for example was take the concept western art and the concept African masks and blend them together not only the geometry but the moral systems entailed in them and these are skills again we can't count and measure and then the final thing I'll mention is something you might call limerence and this is not an ability it's a drive and a motivation the conscious mind hungers for success and prestige the unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task when a craftsman feels lost in his craft when a naturalist feels at one with nature when a believer feels at one with God's love that is what the unconscious mind hungers for and many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused and one of the most beautiful description I've come across in this research of how Minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named Douglas Hofstadter's at the University of Indiana he was married to a woman named Carol and made a wonderful relationship when their kids were five and two Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly and Hofstadter wrote a book called I am a strange loop in the course of that book he describes a moment just months after Carol has died he comes across her picture on the mantle or on a bureau in his bedroom and here's what he wrote I looked at her face and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes and all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed that's me that's me and those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before about the fusion of our souls into one higher-level entity about the fact that the core of both our souls they are identical hopes and dreams for our children about the notion that those hopes were not separate and distinct hopes but were just one hope one clear thing that defined us both that welded us into a unit the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children I realized that though Carol had died that core piece of her had not died at all but had it lived on very determinately in my brain the Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom through his suffering Hofstetter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are through the policy failures of last 30 years we have come to acknowledge I think how shallow our view of human nature has been and now as we confront that challenge us and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are comes this revolution in consciousness these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted this new humanism and when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious it had a vast effect on the climate of the times now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious of who we are deep inside and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture thank you

**Transcript**:
and I got my current job I was given a good piece of advice which was to interview three politicians every day and from that much contact with politicians I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another they have what I call logorrhea dementia which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane but what they do have is incredible social skills when you meet them they lock into you they look you in the eye they invade your personal space they massage the back of your head I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal squeezing it I once this was years ago I saw a Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate and they were friends and they hugged each other and they were laughing and their faces were like this far apart and they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other and I was like get a room I don't want to see this but they have those social skills at another case last election cycle I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons bit chip rip zip lip and dip and and he's going into a diner and he goes to the diner introduce himself to a family and says what village are you from in New Hampshire and then he described the home he owned in their village and then he so he goes around the room and then as he's leaving the diner he first names almost everybody he's just met I was like okay that's social skill but the paradox is when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode that social awareness vanishes and they tart talking about like accountants so in the course of my career I've covered a series of failures we sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up and what they really lacked was social trust we invaded Iraq with the military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities we had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn't do anything stupid for 30 years I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureau edek boxes charters private schools vouchers but we've had disappointing results year after year and the fact is people learn from people they love and if you're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student you're not talking about that reality but that reality is expunged from our policymaking process and so that's led to a question for me why are the most

view of human nature that were rational individuals who respond and straightforward ways to incentives and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] KH Academy is most known for its its collection of videos so before I go any further uh let me show you a little bit of a a montage so the hypotenuse is now going to be five this animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America a nice clean band here and this part of Africa we could integrate over the surface and the notation usually is a capital Sigma National Assembly they create the Committee of Public Safety which sounds like a very nice committee notice this is an alahh and it's an alcohol start differentiating into a fector and memory cells a Galaxy hey there's another galaxy oh look there's another galaxy and for dollars is their 30 million plus the $20 million from the American manufacturer if this does not blow your mind then you have no emotion we now have on the order of of of 2200 videos covering everything from basic arithmetic all the way to to to Vector calculus and some of the stuff that that you saw up there uh we have a million students a month using the site watching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day uh uh but what we're going to talk about in this is is is how we're going to the next level uh but before I I do that I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started and uh some some of y'all might know about five years ago I was an analyst at a hedge fund and I was in Boston and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans remotely and I started putting the First YouTube videos up really just as kind of a nice to have just kind of a supplement for my cousin something that might you know give give or a fresher or something and as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up something interesting happened actually a bunch of interesting things happened the first was the feedback from my cousins they told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person and and and once once you get over the backhanded nature of that there was actually something very profound there they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin at first it's very unintuitive but when you actually think about it from their point of view it makes a ton of sense you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin now they can without feeling like they're wasting my time they could if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago or maybe a couple of years ago uh they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if they're bored they can go ahead they can watch it at their own time at their own pace and probably the the the least appreciated uh I guess aspect of of this is the notion that the very first time the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around A New Concept the very last thing you need is another human being saying do you understand this and that's what was happening with the the interaction with my cousins before and now they could just do it kind of in in kind of in the intimacy of their of their of their own room the other thing that happened is is you know I put them on YouTube just just you know for for the you know I I I saw no reason to make it private so I I let other people watch it and and then people started stumbling on it and and I started getting some comments and some letters and and all sorts of kind of feedback from from random people around the world and you know these are just a few this is actually from one of the original calculus videos and someone wrote just on YouTube it was a YouTube comment first time I smiled doing a derivative and's let's let's pause here this person did a derivative and then they smiled and then in response to that same comment this is on the thread you could go on YouTube and and look at these comments someone else wrote same thing here I actually got a natural high in a good mood for the entire day since I remember seeing all of this Matrix text in class and here I'm all like I know Kung Fu and we got a lot of feedback along those lines you know it's clearly it was helping people but then as as the viewership kept growing and kept growing I I started getting letters from from people and it was it was starting to become clear that it was actually more than just a knife to have uh this is just an except from one of one of those letters uh my 12-year-old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math we have tried everything viewed everything bought everything we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through then we went onto the dreaded fractions again he got it we could not believe it he is so excited and so you can imagine you know here I was a uh an analyst at a hedge fund I it was very strange for me to do something of social value I was I was but uh I I I was excited so I kept going and then a few things other things started to dawn on me that Not only would it help my cousins right now or these people who are sending letters but it could maybe that this content will never go old that it could help their kids or their grandkids if Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus I wouldn't have to ass assum assuming he was good I we don't know uh the other thing that happened you know even at this point you know I said okay maybe it's a good supplement it's good for Motivated students it's good for maybe homeschoolers but I didn't think it would be something that would somehow penetrate the classroom but then I started getting letters from teachers and the teachers would write saying we've used your videos to flip the classroom you've given the lectures so now what we do and this could actually happen in every classroom in America tomorrow what I do is I assign the lectures for homework and what used to be homework I now have the students doing in the classroom and I want to I want to pause here for I I want to pause here for a second because there's a couple of interesting things one when those when those teachers are doing that there's there's the obvious benefit there's the the benefit that now their their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did they can pause repeat at their own pace uh at their own time but the more interesting thing this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom by removing the one- siiz fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home and then when you go to the classroom letting them do work having the Stu the teacher walk around having the peers actually be able to interact with each other these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience a bunch of 30 kids with their fingers on their lips not allowed to interact with each other a teacher no matter how good has to give this kind of one- siiz fists all lecture to 30 students you know blank faces slightly antagonistic and now it's a human experience now they're actually in interacting with each other so once the KH Academy kind of you know I I quit my job and and and we turned into a real organization were not for profit um the question is how do we take this to uh the next level how do we take what those teachers were doing to their natural conclusion and so what I'm showing over here these are actual uh exercises that I started writing for my cousins uh the ones I started were much more primitive this is a kind of a a more competent version of it but the paradigm here is we'll we we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept until you get 10 in a row and the the the Con Academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you don't know how to do it but the Paradigm here it seems like a very simple thing 10 in a row you move on but it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right right now in a in a traditional classroom you have a couple of uh homework homework lecture homework lecture and then you have a snapshot exam and that exam whether you get a 70% an 80% a 90% % or 95% the class moves on to the next topic and even that that that 95% student what was the 5% they didn't know maybe they didn't know what what happens when you raise something to the to the zeroth power and then you go build on that in the next concept that's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle and I give you a bicycle maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time and and I give you that that bicycle for two weeks and then I come back after two weeks and I say well let's see you're having trouble taking left turns you can't quite stop you're you're an 80% bicyclist so I put a big c stamp on your forehead and then I say here's a unicycle but as ridiculous as that sounds that's exactly what's happening in in our in our in our classrooms right now and and and the idea is you know you you fast forward and students start good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing uh calculus all of a sudden despite being smart despite having good teachers and it's usually because they had these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation so our our model is learn math the way you would learn anything like the way you would learn a bicycle stay on that bicycle fall off that bicycle do it as long as necessary until you have Mastery the traditional model it penalizes you for experimentation and failure but it does not expect Mastery we encourage you to experiment we encourage you to failure but we do expect Mastery this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry this is Shifting and reflecting functions and and they all fit together we have we have about 90 of these right now and and you could go to the site right now it's all free not not trying to sell anything but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map that top node right there that's literally singled digigit addition it's like 1+ one is equal to two and the Paradigm is once you get 10 in a row on that then it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules so if you keep so it keep this is go further down the knowledge map we're getting into more advanced arithmetic further down you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra further down you start getting into uh Algebra 1 Algebra 2 a little bit of pre-calculus and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on is from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of okay if you know this and that now you're ready for this next concept now that can work well for an individual learner you know and I one for you to do it with your kids but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it'll it'll change what happens at the dinner table but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about and so what I'm showing you here this is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos School District where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren't using textbooks they're not getting one siiz fits-all lectures they're doing KH Academy they're doing that software for roughly half of their math class and I want to make it clear we don't view this as the complete math education what it does is and this is what's happening in Los Altos it frees up time this is the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to a system of equations and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the Mechanics for the for the robot building for for the estimating how high that Hill is based on its on its shadow and so the Paradigm is the teacher walks in every day every kid works at their own base and a teacher get this is actually a live dashboard from Los Alto school district and they look at this dashboard every row is a student every column is one of those Concepts green means the students already proficient blue means that they're working on it no need to worry red means they're stuck and what the teacher does is literally just says let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their their peer now I kind of come from a very data Centric reality so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions oh what do you not understand or what do you do understand and all of the rest so our Paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible really data that in almost any other field is expected if you're in finance or marketing or manufacturing and so the teachers can actually diagnose what's wrong with the students so that they can make their interaction as productive as possible so now the teachers know exactly what the students been up to how long they've been spending every day what videos have they been watching when did they pause the videos what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they been focused on the Outer Circle shows what the exercises they're focused on the inner circle shows the videos they're focused on and the data gets pretty granular so you can actually see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong red is wrong blue is right the leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted they watched the video right over there and then you could see eventually they were able to get 10 in a row it's almost like you can almost see them learning over those last 10 problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them so you know when you talk about self-paced learning it makes sense for everyone you know in education speak differentiated learning but it's kind of crazy what happens when you actually see it in a classroom because every every time we've done this in every classroom we've done over and over again if you go five days into it there's a group of kids who've raised ahead and there's a group of kids who are a little bit slower and in a traditional model if you did a snapshot assessment you say oh these are the gifted kids these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes but when you let every student work at their own pace and we see it over and over and over again you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago you now would think are gifted and we're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder uh kind of how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from uh really just due to a a coincidence of time now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos um our goal is is to use technology to humanize not just in Los Altos but kind of on a global scale well what's happening in education and actually that that kind of brings an interesting point is you know a lot of the effort in in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our mind the relevant metric is student to valuable human time with the teacher ratio so in a traditional model most of the teacher time is spent doing lectures and Grading tests and and and whatnot maybe 5% of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them now 100% of their time is so once again using technology not just flipping the classroom you're humanizing the classroom I'd argue by by a by a factor of five or 10 and as valuable as it is in Los Altos imagine what that does to the adult learner who's embarrassed to go back and and learn stuff that they should have known before before going back to college imagine imagine what it does to a kid a street kid in Kolkata who has to help his family during the day and that's the reason why he or she can't go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or or or or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or or don't know now imagine what happens where you know we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom but this is all one system there's no reason why you can't have that that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom imagine what happens if that student in Kolkata all of a sudden can tutor your son or your son can tutor that kid in Kolkata and I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of of a global One World classroom and that's that's essentially what we're what we're trying to build thank you I ask question time okay I've I've seen some things you're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback energy points merit badges tell me uh what what you're thinking there oh yeah no we we have an awesome team working on it's not and I have to make it clear it's not just me anymore I'm still doing all the videos we have a kind of a rockstar team doing the software um yeah we've put a bunch of game mechanics in there you get these badges we're going to start having leaderboards by areas and you get point it's actually been pretty interesting just the wording of the badging or or how many points you get for doing something we see on a systemwide basis like tens of thousands of like fifth graders or sixth graders going One Direction or another depending on what you know B badge you give them and the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos how how did that come about yeah no Los Altos been kind of it was kind of crazy they they once again I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms uh someone from from their board came and said oh what would you do if you had cart block launch in a classroom and I said well you know I would just every student work at their own pace on something like this we'd give a dashboard you know and they said oh this is kind of radical we have to think about it and uh me and the rest of the team like oh you know they're never going to want to do this uh uh but literally the next day they're like can you can you start in two weeks and so so it's fifth fifth grade math is where that's going on right now it's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and I think they're doing at the district level I think what they're excited about is they can now follow these kids it's not an only in school thing I mean we've even you know on Christmas we saw some of the kids were doing and we can track everything so they can actually track them as they go through the entire District through the Summers as they go from one teacher to an next you have this continuity of of of data that that even at the district level they can see so some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those those kids so you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they they think they need oh yeah actually most of those were were kind of specs by the teachers we made some of those four students so they could see their data but you know we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves and they're literally saying hey you know this is nice but I like that Focus graph a lot of students say a lot of the teachers said I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus a diagram for them so it's all been teacher-driven it's it's been it's been pretty crazy is this ready for prime time do you think a lot of class classes next school year should try this thing out yeah it's ready it's you know it's uh we got a million people on the side already so we can handle a few more and uh it's uh it's a no no reason why why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow and the the vision of the tutoring thing the idea there is if I'm confused about a topic somehow right in user interface I'd find people who are volunteering maybe see their reputation and I could schedule and connect up with those people absolutely you know and this is something that I recommend everyone in this audience to do is you can that those dashboards that teachers have you can go log in right now and you could get you can essentially become a coach for your for your your kids your nephews your cousins or or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club um and yeah you you can start becoming a mentor or tutor really really immediately but uh yeah yeah it's all there well it's amazing I I think you just got a glimpse of the future of Education thank you oh thank you [Music]

weeks and then I come back after two weeks and I say well let's see you're having trouble taking left turns you can't quite stop you're you're an 80% bicyclist so I put a big c stamp on your forehead and then I say here's a unicycle but as ridiculous as that sounds that's exactly what's happening in in our in our in our classrooms right now and and and the idea is you know you you fast forward and students start good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing uh calculus all of a sudden despite being smart despite having good teachers and it's usually because they had these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation so our our model is learn math the way you would learn anything like the way you would learn a bicycle stay on that bicycle fall off that bicycle do it as long as necessary until you have Mastery the traditional model it penalizes you for experimentation and failure but it does not expect Mastery we encourage you to experiment we encourage you to failure but we do expect Mastery this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry this is Shifting and reflecting functions and and they all fit together we have we have about 90 of these right now and and you could go to the site right now it's all free not not trying to sell anything but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map that top node right there that's literally singled digigit addition it's like 1+ one is equal to two and the Paradigm is once you get 10 in a row on that then it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules so if you keep so it keep this is go further down the knowledge map we're getting into more advanced arithmetic further down you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra further down you start getting into uh Algebra 1 Algebra 2 a little bit of pre-calculus and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on is from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of okay if you know this and that now you're ready for this next concept now that can work well for an individual learner you know and I one for you to do it with your kids but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it'll it'll change what happens at the dinner table but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about and so what I'm showing you here this is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos School District where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren't using textbooks they're not getting one siiz fits-all lectures they're doing KH Academy they're doing that software for roughly half of their math class and I want to make it clear we don't view this as the complete math education what it does is and this is what's happening in Los Altos it frees up time this is the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to a system of equations and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the Mechanics for the for the robot building for for the estimating how high that Hill is based on its on its shadow and so the Paradigm is the teacher walks in every day every kid works at their own base and a teacher get this is actually a live dashboard from Los Alto school district and they look at this dashboard every row is a student every column is one of those Concepts green means the students already proficient blue means that they're working on it no need to worry red means they're stuck and what the teacher does is literally just says let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their their peer now I kind of come from a very data Centric reality so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions oh what do you not understand or what do you do understand and all of the rest so our Paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible really data that in almost any other field is expected if you're in finance or marketing or manufacturing and so the teachers can actually diagnose what's wrong with the students so that they can make their interaction as productive as possible so now the teachers know exactly what the students been up to how long they've been spending every day what videos have they been watching when did they pause the videos what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they been focused on the Outer Circle shows what the exercises they're focused on the inner circle shows the videos they're focused on and the data gets pretty granular so you can actually see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong red is wrong blue is right the leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted they watched the video right over there and then you could see eventually they were able to get 10 in a row it's almost like you can almost see them learning over those last 10 problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them so you know when you talk about self-paced learning it makes sense for everyone you know in education speak differentiated learning but it's kind of crazy what happens when you actually see it in a classroom because every every time we've done this in every classroom we've done over and over again if you go five days into it there's a group of kids who've raised ahead and there's a group of kids who are a little bit slower and in a traditional model if you did a snapshot assessment you say oh these are the gifted kids these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes but when you let every student work at their own pace and we see it over and over and over again you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago you now would think are gifted and we're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder uh kind of how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from uh really just due to a a coincidence of time now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos um our goal is is to use technology to humanize not just in Los Altos but kind of on a global scale well what's happening in education and actually that that kind of brings an interesting point is you know a lot of the effort in in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our mind the relevant metric is student to valuable human time with the teacher ratio so in a traditional model most of the teacher time is spent doing lectures and Grading tests and and and whatnot maybe 5% of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them now 100% of their time is so once again using technology not just flipping the classroom you're humanizing the classroom I'd argue by by a by a factor of five or 10 and as valuable as it is in Los Altos imagine what that does to the adult learner who's embarrassed to go back and and learn stuff that they should have known before before going back to college imagine imagine what it does to a kid a street kid in Kolkata who has to help his family during the day and that's the reason why he or she can't go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or or or or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or or don't know now imagine what happens where you know we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom but this is all one system there's no reason why you can't have that that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom imagine what happens if that student in Kolkata all of a sudden can tutor your son or your son can tutor that kid in Kolkata and I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of of a global One World classroom and that's that's essentially what we're what we're trying to build thank you I ask question time okay I've I've seen some things you're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback energy points merit badges tell me uh what what you're thinking there oh yeah no we we have an awesome team working on it's not and I have to make it clear it's not just me anymore I'm still doing all the videos we have a kind of a rockstar team doing the software um yeah we've put a bunch of game mechanics in there you get these badges we're going to start having leaderboards by areas and you get point it's actually been pretty interesting just the wording of the badging or or how many points you get for doing something we see on a systemwide basis like tens of thousands of like fifth graders or sixth graders going One Direction or another depending on what you know B badge you give them and the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos how how did that come about yeah no Los Altos been kind of it was kind of crazy they they once again I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms uh someone from from their board came and said oh what would you do if you had cart block launch in a classroom and I said well you know I would just every student work at their own pace on something like this we'd give a dashboard you know and they said oh this is kind of radical we have to think about it and uh me and the rest of the team like oh you know they're never going to want to do this uh uh but literally the next day they're like can you can you start in two weeks and so so it's fifth fifth grade math is where that's going on right now it's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and I think they're doing at the district level I think what they're excited about is they can now follow these kids it's not an only in school thing I mean we've even you know on Christmas we saw some of the kids were doing and we can track everything so they can actually track them as they go through the entire District through the Summers as they go from one teacher to an next you have this continuity of of of data that that even at the district level they can see so some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those those kids so you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they they think they need oh yeah actually most of those were were kind of specs by the teachers we made some of those four students so they could see their data but you know we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves and they're literally saying hey you know this is nice but I like that Focus graph a lot of students say a lot of the teachers said I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus a diagram for them so it's all been teacher-driven it's it's been it's been pretty crazy is this ready for prime time do you think a lot of class classes next school year should try this thing out yeah it's ready it's you know it's uh we got a million people on the side already so we can handle a few more and uh it's uh it's a no no reason why why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow and the the vision of the tutoring thing the idea there is if I'm confused about a topic somehow right in user interface I'd find people who are volunteering maybe see their reputation and I could schedule and connect up with those people absolutely you know and this is something that I recommend everyone in this audience to do is you can that those dashboards that teachers have you can go log in right now and you could get you can essentially become a coach for your for your your kids your nephews your cousins or or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club um and yeah you you can start becoming a mentor or tutor really really immediately but uh yeah yeah it's all there well it's amazing I I think you just got a glimpse of the future of Education thank you oh thank you [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] KH Academy is most known for its its collection of videos so before I go any further uh let me show you a little bit of a a montage so the hypotenuse is now going to be five this animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America a nice clean band here and this part of Africa we could integrate over the surface and the notation usually is a capital Sigma National Assembly they create the Committee of Public Safety which sounds like a very nice committee notice this is an alahh and it's an alcohol start differentiating into a fector and memory cells a Galaxy hey there's another galaxy oh look there's another galaxy and for dollars is their 30 million plus the $20 million from the American manufacturer if this does not blow your mind then you have no emotion we now have on the order of of of 2200 videos covering everything from basic arithmetic all the way to to to Vector calculus and some of the stuff that that you saw up there uh we have a million students a month using the site watching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day uh uh but what we're going to talk about in this is is is how we're going to the next level uh but before I I do that I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started and uh some some of y'all might know about five years ago I was an analyst at a hedge fund and I was in Boston and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans remotely and I started putting the First YouTube videos up really just as kind of a nice to have just kind of a supplement for my cousin something that might you know give give or a fresher or something and as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up something interesting happened actually a bunch of interesting things happened the first was the feedback from my cousins they told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person and and and once once you get over the backhanded nature of that there was actually something very profound there they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin at first it's very unintuitive but when you actually think about it from their point of view it makes a ton of sense you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin now they can without feeling like they're wasting my time they could if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago or maybe a couple of years ago uh they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if they're bored they can go ahead they can watch it at their own time at their own pace and probably the the the least appreciated uh I guess aspect of of this is the notion that the very first time the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around A New Concept the very last thing you need is another human being saying do you understand this and that's what was happening with the the interaction with my cousins before and now they could just do it kind of in in kind of in the intimacy of their of their of their own room the other thing that happened is is you know I put them on YouTube just just you know for for the you know I I I saw no reason to make it private so I I let other people watch it and and then people started stumbling on it and and I started getting some comments and some letters and and all sorts of kind of feedback from from random people around the world and you know these are just a few this is actually from one of the original calculus videos and someone wrote just on YouTube it was a YouTube comment first time I smiled doing a derivative and's let's let's pause here this person did a derivative and then they smiled and then in response to that same comment this is on the thread you could go on YouTube and and look at these comments someone else wrote same thing here I actually got a natural high in a good mood for the entire day since I remember seeing all of this Matrix text in class and here I'm all like I know Kung Fu and we got a lot of feedback along those lines you know it's clearly it was helping people but then as as the viewership kept growing and kept growing I I started getting letters from from people and it was it was starting to become clear that it was actually more than just a knife to have uh this is just an except from one of one of those letters uh my 12-year-old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math we have tried everything viewed everything bought everything we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through then we went onto the dreaded fractions again he got it we could not believe it he is so excited and so you can imagine you know here I was a uh an analyst at a hedge fund I it was very strange for me to do something of social value I was I was but uh I I I was excited so I kept going and then a few things other things started to dawn on me that Not only would it help my cousins right now or these people who are sending letters but it could maybe that this content will never go old that it could help their kids or their grandkids if Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus I wouldn't have to ass assum assuming he was good I we don't know uh the other thing that happened you know even at this point you know I said okay maybe it's a good supplement it's good for Motivated students it's good for maybe homeschoolers but I didn't think it would be something that would somehow penetrate the classroom but then I started getting letters from teachers and the teachers would write saying we've used your videos to flip the classroom you've given the lectures so now what we do and this could actually happen in every classroom in America tomorrow what I do is I assign the lectures for homework and what used to be homework I now have the students doing in the classroom and I want to I want to pause here for I I want to pause here for a second because there's a couple of interesting things one when those when those teachers are doing that there's there's the obvious benefit there's the the benefit that now their their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did they can pause repeat at their own pace uh at their own time but the more interesting thing this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom by removing the one- siiz fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home and then when you go to the classroom letting them do work having the Stu the teacher walk around having the peers actually be able to interact with each other these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience a bunch of 30 kids with their fingers on their lips not allowed to interact with each other a teacher no matter how good has to give this kind of one- siiz fists all lecture to 30 students you know blank faces slightly antagonistic and now it's a human experience now they're actually in interacting with each other so once the KH Academy kind of you know I I quit my job and and and we turned into a real organization were not for profit um the question is how do we take this to uh the next level how do we take what those teachers were doing to their natural conclusion and so what I'm showing over here these are actual uh exercises that I started writing for my cousins uh the ones I started were much more primitive this is a kind of a a more competent version of it but the paradigm here is we'll we we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept until you get 10 in a row and the the the Con Academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you don't know how to do it but the Paradigm here it seems like a very simple thing 10 in a row you move on but it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right right now in a in a traditional classroom you have a couple of uh homework homework lecture homework lecture and then you have a snapshot exam and that exam whether you get a 70% an 80% a 90% % or 95% the class moves on to the next topic and even that that that 95% student what was the 5% they didn't know maybe they didn't know what what happens when you raise something to the to the zeroth power and then you go build on that in the next concept that's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle and I give you a bicycle maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time and and I give you that that bicycle for two weeks and then I come back after two weeks and I say well let's see you're having trouble taking left turns you can't quite stop you're you're an 80% bicyclist so I put a big c stamp on your forehead and then I say here's a unicycle but as ridiculous as that sounds that's exactly what's happening in in our in our in our classrooms right now and and and the idea is you know you you fast forward and students start good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing uh calculus all of a sudden despite being smart despite having good teachers and it's usually because they had these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation so our our model is learn math the way you would learn anything like the way you would learn a bicycle stay on that bicycle fall off that bicycle do it as long as necessary until you have Mastery the traditional model it penalizes you for experimentation and failure but it does not expect Mastery we encourage you to experiment we encourage you to failure but we do expect Mastery this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry this is Shifting and reflecting functions and and they all fit together we have we have about 90 of these right now and and you could go to the site right now it's all free not not trying to sell anything but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map that top node right there that's literally singled digigit addition it's like 1+ one is equal to two and the Paradigm is once you get 10 in a row on that then it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules so if you keep so it keep this is go further down the knowledge map we're getting into more advanced arithmetic further down you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra further down you start getting into uh Algebra 1 Algebra 2 a little bit of pre-calculus and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on is from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of okay if you know this and that now you're ready for this next concept now that can work well for an individual learner you know and I one for you to do it with your kids but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it'll it'll change what happens at the dinner table but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about and so what I'm showing you here this is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos School District where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren't using textbooks they're not getting one siiz fits-all lectures they're doing KH Academy they're doing that software for roughly half of their math class and I want to make it clear we don't view this as the complete math education what it does is and this is what's happening in Los Altos it frees up time this is the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to a system of equations and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the Mechanics for the for the robot building for for the estimating how high that Hill is based on its on its shadow and so the Paradigm is the teacher walks in every day every kid works at their own base and a teacher get this is actually a live dashboard from Los Alto school district and they look at this dashboard every row is a student every column is one of those Concepts green means the students already proficient blue means that they're working on it no need to worry red means they're stuck and what the teacher does is literally just says let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their their peer now I kind of come from a very data Centric reality so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions oh what do you not understand or what do you do understand and all of the rest so our Paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible really data that in almost any other field is expected if you're in finance or marketing or manufacturing and so the teachers can actually diagnose what's wrong with the students so that they can make their interaction as productive as possible so now the teachers know exactly what the students been up to how long they've been spending every day what videos have they been watching when did they pause the videos what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they been focused on the Outer Circle shows what the exercises they're focused on the inner circle shows the videos they're focused on and the data gets pretty granular so you can actually see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong red is wrong blue is right the leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted they watched the video right over there and then you could see eventually they were able to get 10 in a row it's almost like you can almost see them learning over those last 10 problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them so you know when you talk about self-paced learning it makes sense for everyone you know in education speak differentiated learning but it's kind of crazy what happens when you actually see it in a classroom because every every time we've done this in every classroom we've done over and over again if you go five days into it there's a group of kids who've raised ahead and there's a group of kids who are a little bit slower and in a traditional model if you did a snapshot assessment you say oh these are the gifted kids these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes but when you let every student work at their own pace and we see it over and over and over again you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago you now would think are gifted and we're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder uh kind of how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from uh really just due to a a coincidence of time now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos um our goal is is to use technology to humanize not just in Los Altos but kind of on a global scale well what's happening in education and actually that that kind of brings an interesting point is you know a lot of the effort in in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our mind the relevant metric is student to valuable human time with the teacher ratio so in a traditional model most of the teacher time is spent doing lectures and Grading tests and and and whatnot maybe 5% of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them now 100% of their time is so once again using technology not just flipping the classroom you're humanizing the

go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or or or or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or or don't know now imagine what happens where you know we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom but this is all one system there's no reason why you can't have that that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom imagine what happens if that student in Kolkata all of a sudden can tutor your son or your son can tutor that kid in Kolkata and I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of of a global One World classroom and that's that's essentially what we're what we're trying to build thank you I ask question time okay I've I've seen some things you're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback energy points merit badges tell me uh what what you're thinking there oh yeah no we we have an awesome team working on it's not and I have to make it clear it's not just me anymore I'm still doing all the videos we have a kind of a rockstar team doing the software um yeah we've put a bunch of game mechanics in there you get these badges we're going to start having leaderboards by areas and you get point it's actually been pretty interesting just the wording of the badging or or how many points you get for doing something we see on a systemwide basis like tens of thousands of like fifth graders or sixth graders going One Direction or another depending on what you know B badge you give them and the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos how how did that come about yeah no Los Altos been

fifth fifth grade math is where that's going on right now it's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and I think they're doing at the district level I think what they're excited about

around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus a diagram for them so it's all been teacher-driven it's it's been it's been pretty crazy is this ready for prime time do you think a lot of class classes next school year should try this thing out yeah it's ready it's you know it's uh we got a million people on the side already so we can handle a few more and uh it's uh it's a no no reason why why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow and the the vision of the tutoring thing the idea there is if I'm confused about a topic somehow right in user interface I'd find people who are volunteering maybe see their reputation and I could schedule and connect up with those people absolutely you know and this is something that I recommend everyone in this audience to do is you can that those dashboards that teachers have you can go log in right now and you could get you can essentially become a coach for your for your your kids your nephews your cousins or or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club um and yeah you you can start becoming a mentor or tutor really really immediately but uh yeah yeah it's all there well it's amazing I I think you just got a glimpse of the future of Education thank you oh thank you [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] KH Academy is most known for its its collection of videos so before I go any further uh let me show you a little bit of a a montage so the hypotenuse is now going to be five this animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America a nice clean band here and this part of Africa we could integrate over the surface and the notation usually is a capital Sigma National Assembly they create the Committee of Public Safety which sounds like a very nice committee notice this is an alahh and it's an alcohol start differentiating into a fector and memory cells a Galaxy hey there's another galaxy oh look there's another galaxy and for dollars is their 30 million plus the $20 million from the American manufacturer if this does not blow your mind then you have no emotion we now have on the order of of of 2200 videos covering everything from basic arithmetic all the way to to to Vector calculus and some of the stuff that that you saw up there uh we have a million students a month using the site watching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day uh uh but what we're going to talk about in this is is is how we're going to the next level uh but before I I do that I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started and uh some some of y'all might know about five years ago I was an analyst at a hedge fund and I was in Boston and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans remotely and I started putting the First YouTube videos up really just as kind of a nice to have just kind of a supplement for my cousin something that might you know give give or a fresher or something and as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up something interesting happened actually a bunch of interesting things happened the first was the feedback from my cousins they told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person and and and once once you get over the backhanded nature of that there was actually something very profound there they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin at first it's very unintuitive but when you actually think about it from their point of view it makes a ton of sense you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin now they can without feeling like they're wasting my time they could if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago or maybe a couple of years ago uh they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if they're bored they can go ahead they can watch it at their own time at their own pace and probably the the the least appreciated uh I guess aspect of of this is the notion that the very first time the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around A New Concept the very last thing you need is another human being saying do you understand this and that's what was happening with the the interaction with my cousins before and now they could just do it kind of in in kind of in the intimacy of their of their of their own room the other thing that happened is is you know I put them on YouTube just just you know for for the you know I I I saw no reason to make it private so I I let other people watch it and and then people started stumbling on it and and I started getting some comments and some letters and and all sorts of kind of feedback from from random people around the world and you know these are just a few this is actually from one of the original calculus videos and someone wrote just on YouTube it was a YouTube comment first time I smiled doing a derivative and's let's let's pause here this person did a derivative and then they smiled and then in response to that same comment this is on the thread you could go on YouTube and and look at these comments someone else wrote same thing here I actually got a natural high in a good mood for the entire day since I remember seeing all of this Matrix text in class and here I'm all like I know Kung Fu and we got a lot of feedback along those lines you know it's clearly it was helping people but then as as the viewership kept growing and kept growing I I started getting letters from from people and it was it was starting to become clear that it was actually more than just a knife to have uh this is just an except from one of one of those letters uh my 12-year-old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math we have tried everything viewed everything bought everything we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through then we went onto the dreaded fractions again he got it we could not believe it he is so excited and so you can imagine you know here I was a uh an analyst at a hedge fund I it was very strange for me to do something of social value I was I was but uh I I I was excited so I kept going and then a few things other things started to dawn on me that Not only would it help my cousins right now or these people who are sending letters but it could maybe that this content will never go old that it could help their kids or their grandkids if Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus I wouldn't have to ass assum assuming he was good I we don't know uh the other thing that happened you know even at this point you know I said okay maybe it's a good supplement it's good for Motivated students it's good for maybe homeschoolers but I didn't think it would be something that would somehow penetrate the classroom but then I started getting letters from teachers and the teachers would write saying we've used your videos to flip the classroom you've given the lectures so now what we do and this could actually happen in every classroom in America tomorrow what I do is I assign the lectures for homework and what used to be homework I now have the students doing in the classroom and I want to I want to pause here for I I want to pause here for a second because there's a couple of interesting things one when those when those teachers are doing that there's there's the obvious benefit there's the the benefit that now their their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did they can pause repeat at their own pace uh at their own time but the more interesting thing this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom by removing the one- siiz fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home and then when you go to the classroom letting them do work having the Stu the teacher walk around having the peers actually be able to interact with each other these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience a bunch of 30 kids with their fingers on their lips not allowed to interact with each other a teacher no matter how good has to give this kind of one- siiz fists all lecture to 30 students you know blank faces slightly antagonistic and now it's a human experience now they're actually in interacting with each other so once the KH Academy kind of you know I I quit my job and and and we turned into a real organization were not for profit um the question is how do we take this to uh the next level how do we take what those teachers were doing to their natural conclusion and so what I'm showing over here these are actual uh exercises that I started writing for my cousins uh the ones I started were much more primitive this is a kind of a a more competent version of it but the paradigm here is we'll we we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept until you get 10 in a row and the the the Con Academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you don't know how to do it but the Paradigm here it seems like a very simple thing 10 in a row you move on but it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right right now in a in a traditional classroom you have a couple of uh homework homework lecture homework lecture and then you have a snapshot exam and that exam whether you get a 70% an 80% a 90% % or 95% the class moves on to the next topic and even that that that 95% student what was the 5% they didn't know maybe they didn't know what what happens when you raise something to the to the zeroth power and then you go build on that in the next concept that's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle and I give you a bicycle maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time and and I give you that that bicycle for two weeks and then I come back after two weeks and I say well let's see you're having trouble taking left turns you can't quite stop you're you're an 80% bicyclist so I put a big c stamp on your forehead and then I say here's a unicycle but as ridiculous as that sounds that's exactly what's happening in in our in our in our classrooms right now and and and the idea is you know you you fast forward and students start good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing uh calculus all of a sudden despite being smart despite having good teachers and it's usually because they had these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation so our our model is learn math the way you would learn anything like the way you would learn a bicycle stay on that bicycle fall off that bicycle do it as long as necessary until you have Mastery the traditional model it penalizes you for experimentation and failure but it does not expect Mastery we encourage you to experiment we encourage you to failure but we do expect Mastery this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry this is Shifting and reflecting functions and and they all fit together we have we have about 90 of these right now and and you could go to the site right now it's all free not not trying to sell anything but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map that top node right there that's literally singled digigit addition it's like 1+ one is equal to two and the Paradigm is once you get 10 in a row on that then it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules so if you keep so it keep this is go further down the knowledge map we're getting into more advanced arithmetic further down you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra further down you start getting into uh Algebra 1 Algebra 2 a little bit of pre-calculus and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on is from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of okay if you know this and that now you're ready for this next concept now that can work well for an individual learner you know and I one for you to do it with your kids but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it'll it'll change what happens at the dinner table but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about and so what I'm showing you here this is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos School District where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren't using textbooks they're not getting one siiz fits-all lectures they're doing KH Academy they're doing that software for roughly half of their math class and I want to make it clear we don't view this as the complete math education what it does is and this is what's happening in Los Altos it frees up time this is the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to a system of equations and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the Mechanics for the for the robot building for for the estimating how high that Hill is based on its on its shadow and so the Paradigm is the teacher walks in every day every kid works at their own base and a teacher get this is actually a live dashboard from Los Alto school district and they look at this dashboard every row is a student every column is one of those Concepts green means the students already proficient blue means that they're working on it no need to worry red means they're stuck and what the teacher does is literally just says let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their their peer now I kind of come from a very data Centric reality so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions oh what do you not understand or what do you do understand and all of the rest so our Paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible really data that in almost any other field is expected if you're in finance or marketing or manufacturing and so the teachers can actually diagnose what's wrong with the students so that they can make their interaction as productive as possible so now the teachers know exactly what the students been up to how long they've been spending every day what videos have they been watching when did they pause the videos what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they been focused on the Outer Circle shows what the exercises they're focused on the inner circle shows the videos they're focused on and the data gets pretty granular so you can actually see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong red is wrong blue is right the leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted they watched the video right over there and then you could see eventually they were able to get 10 in a row it's almost like you can almost see them learning over those last 10 problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them so you know when you talk about self-paced learning it makes sense for everyone you know in education speak differentiated learning but it's kind of crazy what happens when you actually see it in a classroom because every every time we've done this in every classroom we've done over and over again if you go five days into it there's a group of kids who've raised ahead and there's a group of kids who are a little bit slower and in a traditional model if you did a snapshot assessment you say oh these are the gifted kids these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes but when you let every student work at their own pace and we see it over and over and over again you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago you now would think are gifted and we're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder uh kind of how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from uh really just due to a a coincidence of time now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos um our goal is is to use technology to humanize not just in Los Altos but kind of on a global scale well what's happening in education and actually that that kind of brings an interesting point is you know a lot of the effort in in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our mind the relevant metric is student to valuable human time with the teacher ratio so in a traditional model most of the teacher time is spent doing lectures and Grading tests and and and whatnot maybe 5% of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them now 100% of their time is so once again using technology not just flipping the classroom you're humanizing the classroom I'd argue by by a by a factor of five or 10 and as valuable as it is in Los Altos imagine what that does to the adult learner who's embarrassed to go back and and learn stuff that they should have known before before going back to college imagine imagine what it does to a kid a street kid in Kolkata who has to help his family during the day and that's the reason why he or she can't go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or or or or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or or don't know now imagine what happens where you know we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom but this is all one system there's no reason why you can't have that that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom imagine what happens if that student in Kolkata all of a sudden can tutor your son or your son can tutor that kid in Kolkata and I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of of a global One World classroom and that's that's essentially what we're what we're trying to build thank you I ask question time okay I've I've seen some things you're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback energy points merit badges tell me uh what what you're thinking there oh yeah no we we have an awesome team working on it's not and I have to make it clear it's not just me anymore I'm still doing all the videos we have a kind of a rockstar team doing the software um yeah we've put a bunch of game mechanics in there you get these badges we're going to start having leaderboards by areas and you get point it's actually been pretty interesting just the wording of the badging or or how many points you get for doing something we see on a systemwide basis like tens of thousands of like fifth graders or sixth graders going One Direction or another depending on what you know B badge you give them and the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos how how did that come about yeah no Los Altos been kind of it was kind of crazy they they once again I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms uh someone from from their board came and said oh what would you do if you had cart block launch in a classroom and I said well you know I would just every student work at their own pace on something like this we'd give a dashboard you know and they said oh this is kind of radical we have to think about it and uh me and the rest of the team like oh you know they're never going to want to do this uh uh but literally the next day they're like can you can you start in two weeks and so so it's fifth fifth grade math is where that's going on right now it's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and I think they're doing at the district level I think what they're excited about is they can now follow these kids it's not an only in school thing I mean we've even you know on Christmas we saw some of the kids were doing and we can track everything so they can actually track them as they go through the entire District through the Summers as they go from one teacher to an next you have this continuity of of of data that that even at the district level they can see so some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those those kids so you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they they think they need oh yeah actually most of those were were kind of specs by the teachers we made some of those four students so they could see their data but you know we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves and they're literally saying hey you know this is nice but I like that Focus graph a lot of students say a lot of the teachers said I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus a diagram for them so it's all been teacher-driven it's it's been it's been pretty crazy is this ready for prime time do you think a lot of class classes next school year should try this thing out yeah it's ready it's you know it's uh we got a million people on the side already so we can handle a few more and uh it's uh it's a no no reason why why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow and the the vision of the tutoring thing the idea there is if I'm confused about a topic somehow right in user interface I'd find people who are volunteering maybe see their reputation and I could schedule and connect up with those people absolutely you know and this is something that I recommend everyone in this audience to do is you can that those dashboards that teachers have you can go log in right now and you could get you can essentially become a coach for your for your your kids your nephews your cousins or or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club um and yeah you you can start becoming a mentor or tutor really really immediately but uh yeah yeah it's all there well it's amazing I I think you just got a glimpse of the future of Education thank you oh thank you [Music]

for homework and what used to be homework I now have the students doing in the classroom and I want to I want to pause here for I I want to pause here for a second because there's a couple of interesting things one when those when those teachers are doing that there's there's the obvious benefit there's the the benefit that now their their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did they can pause repeat at their own pace uh at their own time but the more interesting thing this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom by removing the one- siiz fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home and then when you go to the classroom letting them do work having the Stu the teacher walk around having the peers actually be able to interact with each other these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience a bunch of 30 kids with their fingers on their lips not allowed to interact with each other a teacher no matter how good has to give this kind of one- siiz fists all lecture to 30 students you know blank faces slightly antagonistic and now it's a human experience now they're actually in interacting with each other so once the KH Academy kind of you know I I quit my job and and and we turned into a real organization were not for profit um the question is how do we take this to uh the next level how do we take what those teachers were doing to their natural conclusion and so what I'm showing over here these are actual uh exercises that I started writing for my cousins uh the ones I started were much more primitive this is a kind of a a more competent version of it but the paradigm here is we'll we we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept until you get 10 in a row and the the the Con Academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you don't know how to do it but the Paradigm here it seems like a very simple thing 10 in a row you move on but it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right right now in a in a traditional classroom you have a couple of uh homework homework lecture homework lecture and then you have a snapshot exam and that exam whether you get a 70% an 80% a 90% % or 95% the class moves on to the next topic and even that that that 95% student what was the 5% they didn't know maybe they didn't know what what happens when you raise something to the to the zeroth power and then you go build on that in the next concept that's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle and I give you a bicycle maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time and and I give you that that bicycle for two weeks and then I come back after two weeks and I say well let's see you're having trouble taking left turns you can't quite stop you're you're an 80% bicyclist so I put a big c stamp on your forehead and then I say here's a unicycle but as ridiculous as that sounds that's exactly what's happening in in our in our in our classrooms right now and and and the idea is you know you you fast forward and students start good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing uh calculus all of a sudden despite being smart despite having good teachers and it's usually because they had these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation so our our model is learn math the way you would learn anything like the way you would learn a bicycle stay on that bicycle fall off that bicycle do it as long as necessary until you have Mastery the traditional model it penalizes you for experimentation and failure but it does not expect Mastery we encourage you to experiment we encourage you to failure but we do expect Mastery this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry this is Shifting and reflecting functions and and they all fit together we have we have about 90 of these right now and and you could go to the site right now it's all free not not trying to sell anything but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map that top node right there that's literally singled digigit addition it's like 1+ one is equal to two and the Paradigm is once you get 10 in a row on that then it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules so if you keep so it keep this is go further down the knowledge map we're getting into more advanced arithmetic further down you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra further down you start getting into uh Algebra 1 Algebra 2 a little bit of pre-calculus and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on is from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of okay if you know this and that now you're ready for this next concept now that can work well for an individual learner you know and I one for you to do it with your kids but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it'll it'll change what happens at the dinner table but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about and so what I'm showing you here this is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos School District where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren't using textbooks they're not getting one siiz fits-all lectures they're doing KH Academy they're doing that software for roughly half of their math class and I want to make it clear we don't view this as the complete math education what it does is and this is what's happening in Los Altos it frees up time this is the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to a system of equations and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the Mechanics for the for the robot building for for the estimating how high that Hill is based on its on its shadow and so the Paradigm is the teacher walks in every day every kid works at their own base and a teacher get this is actually a live dashboard from Los Alto school district and they look at this dashboard every row is a student every column is one of those Concepts green means the students already proficient blue means that they're working on it no need to worry red means they're stuck and what the teacher does is literally just says let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their their peer now I kind of come from a very data Centric reality so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions oh what do you not understand or what do you do understand and all of the rest so our Paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible really data that in almost any other field is expected if you're in finance or marketing or manufacturing and so the teachers can actually diagnose what's wrong with the students so that they can make their interaction as productive as possible so now the teachers know exactly what the students been up to how long they've been spending every day what videos have they been watching when did they pause the videos what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they been focused on the Outer Circle shows what the exercises they're focused on the inner circle shows the videos they're focused on and the data gets pretty granular so you can actually see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong red is wrong blue is right the leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted they watched the video right over there and then you could see eventually they were able to get 10 in a row it's almost like you can almost see them learning over those last 10 problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them so you know when you talk about self-paced learning it makes sense for everyone you know in education speak differentiated learning but it's kind of crazy what happens when you actually see it in a classroom because every every time we've done this in every classroom we've done over and over again if you go five days into it there's a group of kids who've raised ahead and there's a group of kids who are a little bit slower and in a traditional model if you did a snapshot assessment you say oh these are the gifted kids these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes but when you let every student work at their own pace and we see it over and over and over again you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago you now would think are gifted and we're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder uh kind of how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from uh really just due to a a coincidence of time now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos um our goal is is to use technology to humanize not just in Los Altos but kind of on a global scale well what's happening in education and actually that that kind of brings an interesting point is you know a lot of the effort in in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our mind the relevant metric is student to valuable human time with the teacher ratio so in a traditional model most of the teacher time is spent doing lectures and Grading tests and and and whatnot maybe 5% of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them now 100% of their time is so once again using technology not just flipping the classroom you're humanizing the classroom I'd argue by by a by a factor of five or 10 and as valuable as it is in Los Altos imagine what that does to the adult learner who's embarrassed to go back and and learn stuff that they should have known before before going back to college imagine imagine what it does to a kid a street kid in Kolkata who has to help his family during the day and that's the reason why he or she can't go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or or or or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or or don't know now imagine what happens where you know we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom but this is all one system there's no reason why you can't have that that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom imagine what happens if that student in Kolkata all of a sudden can tutor your son or your son can tutor that kid in Kolkata and I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of of a global One World classroom and that's that's essentially what we're what we're trying to build thank you I ask question time okay I've I've seen some things you're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback energy points merit badges tell me uh what what you're thinking there oh yeah no we we have an awesome team working on it's not and I have to make it clear it's not just me anymore I'm still doing all the videos we have a kind of a rockstar team doing the software um yeah we've put a bunch of game mechanics in there you get these badges we're going to start having leaderboards by areas and you get point it's actually been pretty interesting just the wording of the badging or or how many points you get for doing something we see on a systemwide basis like tens of thousands of like fifth graders or sixth graders going One Direction or another depending on what you know B badge you give them and the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos how how did that come about yeah no Los Altos been kind of it was kind of crazy they they once again I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms uh someone from from their board came and said oh what would you do if you had cart block launch in a classroom and I said well you know I would just every student work at their own pace on something like this we'd give a dashboard you know and they said oh this is kind of radical we have to think about it and uh me and the rest of the team like oh you know they're never going to want to do this uh uh but literally the next day they're like can you can you start in two weeks and so so it's fifth fifth grade math is where that's going on right now it's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and I think they're doing at the district level I think what they're excited about is they can now follow these kids it's not an only in school thing I mean we've even you know on Christmas we saw some of the kids were doing and we can track everything so they can actually track them as they go through the entire District through the Summers as they go from one teacher to an next you have this continuity of of of data that that even at the district level they can see so some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those those kids so you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they they think they need oh yeah actually most of those were were kind of specs by the teachers we made some of those four students so they could see their data but you know we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves and they're literally saying hey you know this is nice but I like that Focus graph a lot of students say a lot of the teachers said I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus a diagram for them so it's all been teacher-driven it's it's been it's been pretty crazy is this ready for prime time do you think a lot of class classes next school year should try this thing out yeah it's ready it's you know it's uh we got a million people on the side already so we can handle a few more and uh it's uh it's a no no reason why why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow and the the vision of the tutoring thing the idea there is if I'm confused about a topic somehow right in user interface I'd find people who are volunteering maybe see their reputation and I could schedule and connect up with those people absolutely you know and this is something that I recommend everyone in this audience to do is you can that those dashboards that teachers have you can go log in right now and you could get you can essentially become a coach for your for your your kids your nephews your cousins or or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club um and yeah you you can start becoming a mentor or tutor really really immediately but uh yeah yeah it's all there well it's amazing I I think you just got a glimpse of the future of Education thank you oh thank you [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] there's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs the fact is that we're living longer Medicine has done a much better job making us live longer and the problem is as we age our organs tend to fail more and so currently there not enough organs to go around in fact in the last ten years a number of patients require an organ has doubled well in the same time the actual number of transplants has barely gone up this is now a public health crisis so that's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine it really involves many different areas you can use actually scaffolds biomaterials they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt but specific materials you can actually implanted patients and they will do well and help you regenerate or we can use cells alone either your very own cells or different stem cell populations or we can use both we can use actually biomaterials and the cells together and that's where the field is today but it's actually not a new field interestingly this is a book that was published back in 1938 titled a culture of organs the first author Alexis Carrel and Nobel Prize winner he actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels and some of the blood vessel grafts were used today were actually designed by Alexis but I want you to note his co-author Charles Lindbergh that's the same Charles Lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with Alexis at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the area of the culture of organs so the fields been around for so long why so field clinical advances and that really has to do to many different challenges but if I were to point to three challenges the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time and many advances now we can do that fairly readily the second challenge with cells we could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body over the last 20 years years we've basically tackled that many scientists can now grow many different types of cells plus we have stem cells but even now 2011 there's still certain cells that we just can grow from the patient liver cells nerve cells pancreatic cells still can grow them even today and the third challenge is vascularity the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them so we can actually use biomaterials now this is actually biomaterial we can weave them knit them or we can make them like you see here this is actually like a cotton candy machine you saw this spray going in that was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure this tubular eye structure which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so and that's exactly what we did here because it's actually a patient who presented with a deceased organ and we then created one of these smart biomaterials and we then use that smart bomb material to replace and repair that patients structure what we did was we actually use the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge if you will and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue and you see that patient now six months after with an x-ray showing you the regenerated tissue which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope we can also use cells alone these are actually cells that we obtained these are stem cells that we create from specific sources and these are we can drive them to chem heart cells and they start beating in culture so they know what to do the cells genetically know what to then they start beating together now today many clinical trials using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease so that's actually now in patients or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures we can then use the patient's own cells or some cell population and the biomaterials the scaffolds together so the concept here is if you do have a or injured organ we take a very small piece of that tissue listen half the size of a postage stamp we then tease the cells apart we grow the cells outside the body we then take a scaffold a biomaterial again looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt we then shape that material and we then use those cells to code that material one layer at a time very much like baking a layer cake if you will we then place that in an oven-like device and we're able to create that structure and bring it out this is actually a hard valve that we have engineered and you can see here we have the structure of the heart valve and we've seated that with cells and then we exercise that you so you see the leaflets opening and closing of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to to further studies another technology we have used in patients actually involves bladders we actually take a very small piece of a bladder from the patient less than half the size of a postage stamp we then grow the cells outside the body take the scaffold coat the scaffold with the cells the patient's own cells two different cell types we then put it in this oven like device has the same conditions as a human body 37 degrees centigrade 95% oxygen a few weeks later you have your engineered organ that we're then able to implant back into the patient for these specific patients we actually just suture these materials we use three-dimensional imaging analysis but we actually created these biomaterials by hand but we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells we use now some type of technologies where first solid organs for example like the liver what we do is we take discard livers as you know a lot of organs are actually discarded not used so we can take these liver structures which are not going to be used and we then put them in a washing machine like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away two weeks later you have something that looks like a liver you can hold it like a liver but it has no cells it's just a skeleton of the liver and we then can Reaper fuse the liver with cells preserving the blood vessel tree so we actually profuse first a blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells and we not been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology another technology that we've used is actually that of printing this is actually a desktop inkjet printer but instead of using ink we're using cells and you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure and there's a 3d elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through then finally you're able to get that structure out you can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it and this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implant it as you see here that's all new bone that was implanted using these techniques another more advanced technology we're looking at right now our next generation of technologies are more sophisticated printers this particular printer with worthy signing now is actually 1 we print right on the patient so what you see here is I know it sounds funny but that's the way it works because in reality what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound and you have a scanner basically a cliff like a flatbed scanner that's what you see here on the right side you see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the print hits actually printing the layers that you require on the patient's themselves this is how it actually works here's a scanner going through scanning the wound once it's scanned sends information in layers the correct layers of cells where they need to be and now you're going to see here a demo of is this actually being done in a representative wound and we actually do this with a gel so you can lift the gel material so once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be and this is actually new technology still under development we're also working on more sophisticated printers because in reality our biggest challenge are the solid organs I don't know if you realize this but ninety percent of the patients and the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney patients are dying every day because we don't have enough of those organs to go around so this is more challenging large organ vascular a lot of blood vessels supply a lot of cells present so the strategy here is this is actually a CT scan an x-ray and we go layer by layer using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys we then are able to actually image those do 360-degree rotation to actually analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form so we go layer by layer through the organ analyzing each layer as we go through the organ and we then are able to send that information as you see here through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient this actually shows the actual printer and this actually shows that printing in fact we actually have the printer right here so I'm in while we've been talking today we've actually you can actually see the printer back here in the backstage that's actually the actual printer right now and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here it takes about seven hours to print the kidneys this is about three hours into it now and dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we print a little bit earlier today put a pair of gloves here thank you you're backwards so these clothes are a little bit small on me but here it is you can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today that's a little bit of consistency to it this is dr. Connie who's been working with us in this project and we went a part of our team Thank You dr. Kahn appreciate it so this is actually a new generation this is actually the printer that you see here on stage and this is actually a new technologies we're working on now in reality you know we now have a long history of doing this I'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology that we have had in patients now for a while and this is actually a very brief clip only about 30 seconds of a patient who actually received an organ I was really sick I could barely get out of bed I was missing school it was just pretty much miserable I couldn't you know go out in play you know basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside it was I felt so sick I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like if I was on that so after the surgery life got a lot better for me I was able to do more things I was able to wrestle in high school I became the captain the team and that was great I was able to be you know the normal kid with my friends and because they use my own cells to you know build this bladder it's gonna be with me I got it for life so I'm all set these experiments sometimes work and it's very cool when they do Luke come up please so look before last night when's the last time you saw Tony ten years ago when I had my surgery and it's really great to see him I'm tell us a little about what you're doing well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut I'm a sophomore and studying communications TV and mass media and basically trying to live life like a normal kid which I always wanted growing up but it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working I went through about 16 surgeries and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was ten and this surgery came along and basically made me who I am - and saved my life I'm Tony Dunne hundreds of these what I know from he's he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff I know I was one of first ten people to have this surgery and when I was ten I didn't realize how amazing it was I was a little kid and I was like yet I'll have that I'll have that surgery I all I wanted to do is to get better and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing um when you know you got this call out of the blue I mean Tony's really shy and it took a lot of convincing to get somebody as modest as Tony to allow us to bring Luke so look you go to your communications professors your majoring communications and you ask them for permission to come to Ted which might have a little bit to do with communications and what was their reaction most of my professors were all for it and they said bring pictures and and you know show me the clips online and I'm happy for you there are a couple that were a little stubborn but I had to talk to I pulled him aside well it's an honor of privilege to meet you thank you so much you

[Music] there's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs the fact is that we're living longer Medicine has done a much better job making us live longer and the problem is as we age our organs tend to fail more and so currently there not enough organs to go around in fact in the last ten years a number of patients require an organ has doubled well in the same time the actual number of transplants has barely gone up this is now a public health crisis so that's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine it really involves many different areas you can use actually scaffolds biomaterials they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt but specific materials you can actually implanted patients and they will do well and help you regenerate or we can use cells alone either your very own cells or different stem cell populations or we can use both we can use actually biomaterials and the cells together and that's where the field is today but it's actually not a new field interestingly this is a book that was published back in 1938 titled a culture of organs the first author Alexis Carrel and Nobel Prize winner he actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels and some of the blood vessel grafts were used today were actually designed by Alexis but I want you to note his co-author Charles Lindbergh that's the same Charles Lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with Alexis at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the area of the culture of organs so the fields been around for so long why so field clinical advances and that really has to do to many different challenges but if I were to point to three challenges the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time and many advances now we can do that fairly readily the second challenge with cells we could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body over the last 20 years years we've basically tackled that many scientists can now grow many different types of cells plus we have stem cells but even now 2011 there's still certain cells that we just can grow from the patient liver cells nerve cells pancreatic cells still can grow them even today and the third challenge is vascularity the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them so we can actually use biomaterials now this is actually biomaterial we can weave them knit them or we can make them like you see here this is actually like a cotton candy machine you saw this spray going in that was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure this tubular eye structure which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so and that's exactly what we did here because it's actually a patient who presented with a deceased organ and we then created one of these smart biomaterials and we then use that smart bomb material to replace and repair that patients structure what we did was we actually use the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge if you will and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue and you see that patient now six months after with an x-ray showing you the regenerated tissue which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope we can also use cells alone these are actually cells that we obtained these are stem cells that we create from specific sources and these are we can drive them to chem heart cells and they start beating in culture so they know what to do the cells genetically know what to then they start beating together now today many clinical trials using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease so that's actually now in patients or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures we can then use the patient's own cells or some cell population and the biomaterials the scaffolds together so the concept here is if you do have a or injured organ we take a very small piece of that tissue listen half the size of a postage stamp we then tease the cells apart we grow the cells outside the body we then take a scaffold a biomaterial again looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt we then shape that material and we then use those cells to code that material one layer at a time very much like baking a layer cake if you will we then place that in an oven-like device and we're able to create that structure and bring it out this is actually a hard valve that we have engineered and you can see here we have the structure of the heart valve and we've seated that with cells and then we exercise that you so you see the leaflets opening and closing of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to to further studies another technology we have used in patients actually involves bladders we actually take a very small piece of a bladder from the patient less than half the size of a postage stamp we then grow the cells outside the body take the scaffold coat the scaffold with the cells the patient's own cells two different cell types we then put it in this oven like device has the same conditions as a human body 37 degrees centigrade 95% oxygen a few weeks later you have your engineered organ that we're then able to implant back into the patient for these specific patients we actually just suture these materials we use three-dimensional imaging analysis but we actually created these biomaterials by hand but we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells we use now some type of technologies where first solid organs for example like the liver what we do is we take discard livers as you know a lot of organs are actually discarded not used so we can take these liver structures which are not going to be used and we then put them in a washing machine like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away two weeks later you have something that looks like a liver you can hold it like a liver but it has no cells it's just a skeleton of the liver and we then can Reaper fuse the liver with cells preserving the blood vessel tree so we actually profuse first a blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells and we not been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology another technology that we've used is actually that of printing this is actually a desktop inkjet printer but instead of using ink we're using cells and you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure and there's a 3d elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through then finally you're able to get that structure out you can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it and this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implant it as you see here that's all new bone that was implanted using these techniques another more advanced technology we're looking at right now our next generation of technologies are more sophisticated printers this particular printer with worthy signing now is actually 1 we print right on the patient so what you see here is I know it sounds funny but that's the way it works because in reality what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound and you have a scanner basically a cliff like a flatbed scanner that's what you see here on the right side you see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the print hits actually printing the layers that you require on the patient's themselves this is how it actually works here's a scanner going through scanning the wound once it's scanned sends information in layers the correct layers of cells where they need to be and now you're going to see here a demo of is this actually being done in a representative wound and we actually do this with a gel so you can lift the gel material so once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be and this is actually new technology still under development we're also working on more sophisticated printers because in reality our biggest challenge are the solid organs I don't know if you realize this but ninety percent of the patients and the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney patients are dying every day because we don't have enough of those organs to go around so this is more challenging large organ vascular a lot of blood vessels supply a lot of cells present so the strategy here is this is actually a CT scan an x-ray and we go layer by layer using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys we then are able to actually image those do 360-degree rotation to actually analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form so we go layer by layer through the organ analyzing each layer as we go through the organ and we then are able to send that information as you see here through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient this actually shows the actual printer and this actually shows that printing in fact we actually have the printer right here so I'm in while we've been talking today we've actually you can actually see the printer back here in the backstage that's actually the actual printer right now and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here it takes about seven hours to print the kidneys this is about three hours into it now and dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we print a little bit earlier today put a pair of gloves here thank you you're backwards so these clothes are a little bit small on me but here it is you can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today that's a little bit of consistency to it this is dr. Connie who's been working with us in this project and we went a part of our team Thank You dr. Kahn appreciate it so this is actually a new generation this is actually the printer that you see here on stage and this is actually a new technologies we're working on now in reality you know we now have a long history of doing this I'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology that we have had in patients now for a while and this is actually a very brief clip only about 30 seconds of a patient who actually received an organ I was really sick I could barely get out of bed I was missing school it was just pretty much miserable I couldn't you know go out in play you know basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside it was I felt so sick I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like if I was on that so after the surgery life got a lot better for me I was able to do more things I was able to wrestle in high school I became the captain the team and that was great I was able to be you know the normal kid with my friends and because they use my own cells to you know build this bladder it's gonna be with me I got it for life so I'm all set these experiments sometimes work and it's very cool when they do Luke come up please so look before last night when's the last time you saw Tony ten years ago when I had my surgery and it's really great to see him I'm tell us a little about what you're doing well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut I'm a sophomore and studying communications TV and mass media and basically trying to live life like a normal kid which I always wanted growing up but it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working I went through about 16 surgeries and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was ten and this surgery came along and basically made me who I am - and saved my life I'm Tony Dunne hundreds of these what I know from he's he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff I know I was one of first ten people to have this surgery and when I was ten I didn't realize how amazing it was I was a little kid and I was like yet I'll have that I'll have that surgery I all I wanted to do is to get better and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing um when you know you got this call out of the blue I mean Tony's really shy and it took a lot of convincing to get somebody as modest as Tony to allow us to bring Luke so look you go to your communications professors your majoring communications and you ask them for permission to come to Ted which might have a little bit to do with communications and what was their reaction most of my professors were all for it and they said bring pictures and and you know show me the clips online and I'm happy for you there are a couple that were a little stubborn but I had to talk to I pulled him aside well it's an honor of privilege to meet you thank you so much you

then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so and that's exactly what we did here because it's actually a patient who presented with a deceased organ and we then created one of these smart biomaterials and we then use that smart bomb material to replace and repair that patients structure what we did was we actually use the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge if you will and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue and you see that patient now six months after with an x-ray showing you the regenerated tissue which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope we can also use cells alone these are actually cells that we obtained these are stem cells that we create from specific sources and these are we can drive them to chem heart cells and they start beating in culture so they know what to do the cells genetically know what to then they start beating together now today many clinical trials using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease so that's actually now in patients or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures we can then use the patient's own cells or some cell population and the biomaterials the scaffolds together so the concept here is if you do have a or injured organ we take a very small piece of that tissue listen half the size of a postage stamp we then tease the cells apart we grow the cells outside the body we then take a scaffold a biomaterial again looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt we then shape that material and we then use those cells to code that material one layer at a time very much like baking a layer cake if you will we then place that in an oven-like device and we're able to create that structure and bring it out this is actually a hard valve that we have engineered and you can see here we have the structure of the heart valve and we've seated that with cells and then we exercise that you so you see the leaflets opening and closing of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to to further studies another technology we have used in patients actually involves bladders we actually take a very small piece of a bladder from the patient less than half the size of a postage stamp we then grow the cells outside the body take the scaffold coat the scaffold with the cells the patient's own cells two different cell types we then put it in this oven like device has the same conditions as a human body 37 degrees centigrade 95% oxygen a few weeks later you have your engineered organ that we're then able to implant back into the patient for these specific patients we actually just suture these materials we use three-dimensional imaging analysis but we actually created these biomaterials by hand but we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells we use now some type of technologies where first solid organs for example like the liver what we do is we take discard livers as you know a lot of organs are actually discarded not used so we can take these liver structures which are not going to be used and we then put them in a washing machine like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away two weeks later you have something that looks like a liver you can hold it like a liver but it has no cells it's just a skeleton of the liver and we then can Reaper fuse the liver with cells preserving the blood vessel tree so we actually profuse first a blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells and we not been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology another technology that we've used is actually that of printing this is actually a desktop inkjet printer but instead of using ink we're using cells and you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure and there's a 3d elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through then finally you're able to get that structure out you can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it and this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implant it as you see here that's all new bone that was implanted using these techniques another more advanced technology we're looking at right now our next generation of technologies are more sophisticated printers this particular printer with worthy signing now is actually 1 we print right on the patient so what you see here is I know it sounds funny but that's the way it works because in reality what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound and you have a scanner basically a cliff like a flatbed scanner that's what you see here on the right side you see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the print hits actually printing the layers that you require on the patient's themselves this is how it actually works here's a scanner going through scanning the wound once it's scanned sends information in layers the correct layers of cells where they need to be and now you're going to see here a demo of is this actually being done in a representative wound and we actually do this with a gel so you can lift the gel material so once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be and this is actually new technology still under development we're also working on more sophisticated printers because in reality our biggest challenge are the solid organs I don't know if you realize this but ninety percent of the patients and the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney patients are dying every day because we don't have enough of those organs to go around so this is more challenging large organ vascular a lot of blood vessels supply a lot of cells present so the strategy here is this is actually a CT scan an x-ray and we go layer by layer using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys we then are able to actually image those do 360-degree rotation to actually analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form so we go layer by layer through the organ analyzing each layer as we go through the organ and we then are able to send that information as you see here through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient this actually shows the actual printer and this actually shows that printing in fact we actually have the printer right here so I'm in while we've been talking today we've actually you can actually see the printer back here in the backstage that's actually the actual printer right now and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here it takes about seven hours to print the kidneys this is about three hours into it now and dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we print a little bit earlier today put a pair of gloves here thank you you're backwards so these clothes are a little bit small on me but here it is you can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today that's a little bit of consistency to it this is dr. Connie who's been working with us in this project and we went a part of our team Thank You dr. Kahn appreciate it so this is actually a new generation this is actually the printer that you see here on stage and this is actually a new technologies we're working on now in reality you know we now have a long history of doing this I'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology that we have had in patients now for a while and this is actually a very brief clip only about 30 seconds of a patient who actually received an organ I was really sick I could barely get out of bed I was missing school it was just pretty much miserable I couldn't you know go out in play you know basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside it was I felt so sick I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like if I was on that so after the surgery life got a lot better for me I was able to do more things I was able to wrestle in high school I became the captain the team and that was great I was able to be you know the normal kid with my friends and because they use my own cells to you know build this bladder it's gonna be with me I got it for life so I'm all set these experiments sometimes work and it's very cool when they do Luke come up please so look before last night when's the last time you saw Tony ten years ago when I had my surgery and it's really great to see him I'm tell us a little about what you're doing well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut I'm a sophomore and studying communications TV and mass media and basically trying to live life like a normal kid which I always wanted growing up but it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working I went through about 16 surgeries and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was ten and this surgery came along and basically made me who I am - and saved my life I'm Tony Dunne hundreds of these what I know from he's he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff I know I was one of first ten people to have this surgery and when I was ten I didn't realize how amazing it was I was a little kid and I was like yet I'll have that I'll have that surgery I all I wanted to do is to get better and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing um when you know you got this call out of the blue I mean Tony's really shy and it took a lot of convincing to get somebody as modest as Tony to allow us to bring Luke so look you go to your communications professors your majoring communications and you ask them for permission to come to Ted which might have a little bit to do with communications and what was their reaction most of my professors were all for it and they said bring pictures and and you know show me the clips online and I'm happy for you there are a couple that were a little stubborn but I had to talk to I pulled him aside well it's an honor of privilege to meet you thank you so much you

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC PLAYING] My goal is to not actually
do any measurements other than using pie. So the entire thing is
going to pie based. We get the circumference in
the exact number of pies-- give or take-- we get the
diameter in number of pies. Divide one by the other,
we get pi. [MUSIC PLAYING] Pi was historically rarely
calculated this way, because it's notoriously inaccurate
to try and get-- I know, we're idiots-- it's
notoriously inaccurate to try and calculate pi by measuring
a circle. [MUSIC PLAYING] To get any kind of accuracy on
our final answer we have to be as precise as we can be. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is a mild problem, because
I want to go from the very edge of the circle. But as you can see, I've
positioned all the pies exactly on the line as if
they're little mini tangents. So I'm going to have to move
these two out and then I can start doing the diameter exactly
on the circumference there, like that. [MUSIC PLAYING] So that's 84 and 1/3. 264 and 2/3 pies around,
we have the diameter, is 84 and 1/3 pie. To get pi, we just divide the
circumference by the diameter. OK, and if we actually work out
what that is, it equals-- that's pretty good. Pi from pies, we got 3.13834,
which is approximately 3.14. So using pies, we've
got pi to be 3.14. I am a very happy
man right now. With the diameter, and if I know
that ratio, I can just measure the diameter. That's the easy bit
to measure. The center point will
be my pen, and the outside will be the chalk. So the pies, in theory, are
a fairly consistent size. So they're all-- yeah they're about the same. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING]

notoriously inaccurate to try and calculate pi by measuring
a circle. [MUSIC PLAYING] To get any kind of accuracy on
our final answer we have to be as precise as we can be. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is a mild problem, because
I want to go from the very edge of the circle. But as you can see, I've
positioned all the pies exactly on the line as if
they're little mini tangents. So I'm going to have to move
these two out and then I can start doing the diameter exactly
on the circumference there, like that. [MUSIC PLAYING] So that's 84 and 1/3. 264 and 2/3 pies around,
we have the diameter, is 84 and 1/3 pie. To get pi, we just divide the
circumference by the diameter. OK, and if we actually work out
what that is, it equals-- that's pretty good. Pi from pies, we got 3.13834,
which is approximately 3.14. So using pies, we've
got pi to be 3.14. I am a very happy
man right now. With the diameter, and if I know
that ratio, I can just measure the diameter. That's the easy bit
to measure. The center point will
be my pen, and the outside will be the chalk. So the pies, in theory, are
a fairly consistent size. So they're all-- yeah they're about the same. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING]

going to pie based. We get the circumference in

diameter in number of pies. Divide one by the other,
we get pi. [MUSIC PLAYING] Pi was historically rarely

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar There's a myth
that grandmasters can see ten, fifteen, twenty moves ahead. And it's a great myth
because I'm a grandmaster and it makes me look
like a super freaking genius. But the truth is, in just the first four moves, there are 318 billion ways you could play. Now, that would be cool
if I could pull that off, but grandmasters just can't,
it's too much. So we use different techniques
to be able to look ahead. And some of these techniques
include chunking, which means taking a group,
a chess position, and seeing what possibilities
can come from just that group; or pattern recognition, which is just going over a lot
of positions that look very similarly and extrapolating truths from that; the stepping-stone method, which is to take a position,
freeze it in your mind, and go from there
to guess the next position. But one of my favorites that I love to solve
these kind of chess puzzles, is called retrograde analysis. And what you do with retrograde analysis is that in order to look ahead,
it pays to look backwards. Now, why is this so useful? Well, in chess,
it's a very complicated case. You got all these chess pieces,
it's 32 pieces, but after five moves, the position
starts to evolve a little bit. And the game starts to go on and you see the chess position
get a little simpler, and a little bit simpler,
and less pieces on the board, until finally -- in this case, a game that I played
in a tournament in Foxwoods, it gets to something like this. When great players play,
it often gets to something like this. You don't see some easy, early checkmate. Grandmasters see through all that stuff. What you see is some end game,
something really, really simple. And we like to study things like this, grandmasters do, so that if we get to them,
we know how to play them cold, but also so that we can steer
the position that's in front of us, the more complex ones you saw earlier, to something this easy, something this simple. So in this way, when you're dead, I already knew like ten moves ago, because I knew where we were going. Now, why is this so effective? Well, it's something about the human mind,
the problem with the human mind. We're very logical creatures. So I want you to play along
with me a few games. Take a look at this sentence. [After reading this sentence, you will realize that the brain
doesn't recognize a second "the."] Now, most of you reading the sentence
the second time around will realize that you missed
the word "the" the first time around. Your mind is very logical,
it proceeds forward, it just ignores anything
that breaks with its logical stream, and so you don't see
the word "the" the first time, the second "the,"
the first time you read it. But if you read this sentence backwards,
you would automatically catch it. You'd go backwards,
and you get to "brain," you get to "the," and then you say, "Whoa,
there are two 'the's' in the sentence." This is a really cool trick
for proofreading papers. You're writing your paper
and there are these silly mistakes. Why are these mistakes in my paper? You read it backwards,
you'll catch all of them. Alright, let's go on to this problem,
an interesting problem. "Bacteria that double every 24 hours fill a lake it has infested
after precisely 60 days. On what day was the lake half-full?" Now, a lot of people see this problem and they'd think, "30, like,
you know, you split it in half." Well, that's not the right answer. And also people might want a calculator. It's too big, it's math, it's boring,
I don't want to do that either. But if you do this problem backwards,
you get the answer right away. What's the answer? 59, obviously. You start at the end, you go backwards, it's like, "Oh yeah,
it's half-full, the answer is 59." Here's another puzzle,
a little bit more complicated. You have six numbers, 1 through 6. The cards are face down. You and I are going to pick a card. You pick a card and you look at it
and it says the number 2. I look at my card,
I think about it for a minute and I say, "I want to trade." The reason I want to trade, we're going to trade to see
who has the highest number at the end. Do you trade with me? Most people say,
"Of course, I got a 2, 2 sucks! There are four numbers higher,
probability says I'm going to do better." Wrong answer,
you're playing a grandmaster. You start from the back
and you work it out. If I had the number 6,
would I offer to trade? Of course not, I'm not dumb. What about the number 5? Probably not either, because you're
not going to say yes if you have a 6. If 5 is not going to trade
and 6 is not going to trade, 4 is going to be like, "I'm not trading either,
because 5's and 6's don't trade." So you see what happens
as we work backwards. 3 is going to realize:
4, 5, and 6 -- they don't trade, so the offer is definitely a 1 and all of you who said yes,
thanks for your money. (Laughter) So, this retrograde analysis
is used in different places. It's used to prove intoxications
hours after an alleged DUI by Pennsylvania police officers, which is kind of cool. Well, it means don't drink and drive. The use of retro-analysis is used in law,
science, medicine, insurance, stock market, politics, career planning. But I find its use
to be in a more interesting place, maybe one of the most
interesting uses is in this movie, which I know a lot of you know, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," where Brad Pitt plays a guy
who's living his life backwards. And what this movie makes me
think of is that great quote, that quote you often hear
from people who are older, that youth is wasted on the young. Well, if you can see the end game, your youth will not be wasted on you. Thank you very much. (Applause)

the position that's in front of us, the more complex ones you saw earlier, to something this easy, something this simple. So in this way, when you're dead, I already knew like ten moves ago, because I knew where we were going. Now, why is this so effective? Well, it's something about the human mind,
the problem with the human mind. We're very logical creatures. So I want you to play along
with me a few games. Take a look at this sentence. [After reading this sentence, you will realize that the brain
doesn't recognize a second "the."] Now, most of you reading the sentence
the second time around will realize that you missed
the word "the" the first time around. Your mind is very logical,
it proceeds forward, it just ignores anything
that breaks with its logical stream, and so you don't see
the word "the" the first time, the second "the,"
the first time you read it. But if you read this sentence backwards,
you would automatically catch it. You'd go backwards,
and you get to "brain," you get to "the," and then you say, "Whoa,
there are two 'the's' in the sentence." This is a really cool trick
for proofreading papers. You're writing your paper
and there are these silly mistakes. Why are these mistakes in my paper? You read it backwards,
you'll catch all of them. Alright, let's go on to this problem,
an interesting problem. "Bacteria that double every 24 hours fill a lake it has infested
after precisely 60 days. On what day was the lake half-full?" Now, a lot of people see this problem and they'd think, "30, like,
you know, you split it in half." Well, that's not the right answer. And also people might want a calculator. It's too big, it's math, it's boring,
I don't want to do that either. But if you do this problem backwards,
you get the answer right away. What's the answer? 59, obviously. You start at the end, you go backwards, it's like, "Oh yeah,
it's half-full, the answer is 59." Here's another puzzle,
a little bit more complicated. You have six numbers, 1 through 6. The cards are face down. You and I are going to pick a card. You pick a card and you look at it
and it says the number 2. I look at my card,
I think about it for a minute and I say, "I want to trade." The reason I want to trade, we're going to trade to see
who has the highest number at the end. Do you trade with me? Most people say,
"Of course, I got a 2, 2 sucks! There are four numbers higher,
probability says I'm going to do better." Wrong answer,
you're playing a grandmaster. You start from the back
and you work it out. If I had the number 6,
would I offer to trade? Of course not, I'm not dumb. What about the number 5? Probably not either, because you're
not going to say yes if you have a 6. If 5 is not going to trade
and 6 is not going to trade, 4 is going to be like, "I'm not trading either,
because 5's and 6's don't trade." So you see what happens
as we work backwards. 3 is going to realize:
4, 5, and 6 -- they don't trade, so the offer is definitely a 1 and all of you who said yes,
thanks for your money. (Laughter) So, this retrograde analysis
is used in different places. It's used to prove intoxications
hours after an alleged DUI by Pennsylvania police officers, which is kind of cool. Well, it means don't drink and drive. The use of retro-analysis is used in law,
science, medicine, insurance, stock market, politics, career planning. But I find its use
to be in a more interesting place, maybe one of the most
interesting uses is in this movie, which I know a lot of you know, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," where Brad Pitt plays a guy
who's living his life backwards. And what this movie makes me
think of is that great quote, that quote you often hear
from people who are older, that youth is wasted on the young. Well, if you can see the end game, your youth will not be wasted on you. Thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
[Music] well this is about state budgets this is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning but I want to tell you I think it's an important topic that we need to care about state budgets are big big money I'll show you the numbers and they get very little scrutiny the understanding is very low many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are and these budgets are the key for our future they're the key for our kids most education funding whether it's K through 12 or the great universities or community colleges most of money for those things is coming out of these state budgets but we have a problem here's the overall picture US economy it's big fourteen point seven trillion now out of that pie the government spends thirty six percent so this is combining the federal level which is the largest the state level in the local level and it's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what's going on because there's a lot of complex things like Medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries but we're spending 36% well what are we taking in simple business question the answer is 26% now this leaves 10% deficit sort of a mind-blowing number and some of that in fact is due to the fact we've had a economic recession receipts go down some spending programs go up but most of it is not because of that most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends and that creates a huge challenge in fact this is the forecast picture there's various things in here I could say you know we might raise more revenue or medical innovation will make the spending even higher it is a increasingly difficult picture even assuming the economy does quite well probably better than it will do this is is what you see at this overall level now why how did we get here I mean how could you have a problem like this after all there at least on paper there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced only one state says they don't have to balance the budget but what this means actually is that there's a pretense there's no real true balancing going on and in a sense the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don't see things that are actually pretty straightforward challenges when Jerry Brown was elected this was the challenge that was put to him that is through various gimmicks and things a so-called balanced budget had led him to have 25 billion missing out of the 76 billion in proposed spending now he's put together some thoughts about half of that he'll cut another half perhaps in a very complex set of steps taxes will be approved but even so as you go out into those future years various pension costs health costs go up enough and the revenue does not go up enough so you get a big squeeze what were those things that allowed us to hide this well some really nice little tricks and these were somewhat noticed the paper said it's not really balanced it's got holes it perpetuates deficit spending it's riddled with gimmicks and really when you get down to it the guys Enron never would have done this I mean this is so blatant so extreme you know is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do they borrow money they're not supposed to but they figure out a way they make you pay more withholding just helped their cash flow out they sell off the assets they defer the payments they sell off the revenues from tobacco in California is not unique impact there's about five states that are worse the only really four states that don't face this big challenge so it's systemic across the entire country it really comes from the fact that certain long-term obligations healthcare where innovation makes it more expensive early retirement and pension where the age structure gets worse for you and just generosity that these Mis accounting things allowed to develop over time that you've got a problem this is the retiree health care benefits 3 million set aside sixty two billion dollar liability much worse than the car companies and everybody looked at that knew that that was headed towards a huge problem the forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from twenty-six percent of the budget to forty two percent well what's going to give well in order to accommodate that you would have to cut education spending in half it really is this young versus the old to some degree if you don't change that revenue picture if you don't solve what you're doing in health care you're going to be D investing in the young the great University of California University System the great things that have gone on won't happen so far it's meant layoffs increased class sizes within the education community there's this discussion of should it just be the young teachers who get laid off or the less good teachers who get laid off and there's a discussion if you're going to increase class sizes where do you do that how much effect does that have and unfortunately as you get into that people get confused and think well maybe you think that's okay in fact no education spending should not be cut there's ways if it's temporary to minimize the impact but it's a problem it's also really a problem for where we need to go technology has a role to play well we need money to experiment with that to get those those tools in there there's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness measuring them giving them feedback taking videos in the classroom that's something I think is very very important Willie you have allocate dollars for that system and for the that incentive pay in a situation where we have growth you put the new money into this or even if you're flat you might shift money into it but with the type of cuts we're talking about it will be far far harder to get these incentives for excellence order to move over to use technology in the new way so what's going on where where's the brain trust that's in error here well there really is no brain trust it it's sort of the voter's it's sort of us showing up you know just look at this spinning California we'll spend over a hundred billion Microsoft thirty-eight Google about 19 the amount of IQ and good numeric analysis both inside Google and Microsoft and outside with analysts and people that there is opinions should they have spent on that now they wasted their money on this what about this thing it really is quite phenomenal you know everybody has an opinion that there's great great feedback and the numbers are used to make decision if you go over to the education spending the healthcare spending particularly to these long-term trends you don't have that type of involvement on a number that's more important in terms of equity in terms of learning so what do we need to do we need better tools we can get some things out on the internet I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture we need lots more there's a few good books one about school spending and where the money comes from how that's changed over time and the challenge we need better accounting we need to take the fact that the current employees the future liabilities they create that should come out of the current budget we need to understand why they've done the pension accounting the way they have it should be more like private accounting that's the gold standard and finally we need to really reward politicians whenever they say there's these long term problems we can't say oh you're the messenger with bad news we just shot you in fact there are some like these Erskine Bowles Alan Simpson and others who've gone through and given proposal for this overall federal health spending state-level problem but in fact their work sort of pushed off in fact the week afterwards some tax cuts were done that that made the situation even worse than their assumptions so we need these pieces and I think this is a solvable problem you know it's a great country with lots of people but we have to draw those people in because this is about education and just looked at what the tuitions happened with the University of California and project that out for another three four or five years it's unaffordable and that's what that's the kind of thing the investment in the young that makes us great allows us to contribute it allows us to do the art the biotechnology the software and all those those magic things and so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids in our future thank you [Applause] [Music] when I think about succeeding in business I think there's a couple of considerations first and foremost is teamwork today's problems are just too complicated to be solved as an individual and the opportunity to work with others collaboratively where you can build on each other's ideas I think is particularly important I think a second area that's quite important is the understanding of different disciplines it is critical that one be an expert in your major but it is absolutely essential that you have the ability to understand where other disciplines the input from other disciplines and be able to incorporate that to make effective decisions and then last but not least we are in a global business community and so the opportunity to understand cultures different cultures around the world to be able to incorporate some of the learning from those cultures and to incorporate that into your business decisions is essential to success I have three degrees from Cornell so I'd say just about everything that has prepared me came from Cornell and I am indebted to the University for that experience but as I think particularly about my business school career I think the exposure to a variety of disciplines the wealth of resources across the university we're exceptionally helpful

**Transcript**:
[Music] well this is about state budgets this is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning but I want to tell you I think it's an important topic that we need to care about state budgets are big big money I'll show you the numbers and they get very little scrutiny the understanding is very low many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are and these budgets are the key for our future they're the key for our kids most education funding whether it's K through 12 or the great universities or community colleges most of money for those things is coming out of these state budgets but we have a problem here's the overall picture US economy it's big fourteen point seven trillion now out of that pie the government spends thirty six percent so this is combining the federal level which is the largest the state level in the local level and it's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what's going on because there's a lot of complex things like Medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries but we're spending 36% well what are we taking in simple business question the answer is 26% now this leaves 10% deficit sort of a mind-blowing number and some of that in fact is due to the fact we've had a economic recession receipts go down some spending programs go up but most of it is not because of that most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends and that creates a huge challenge in fact this is the forecast picture there's various things in here I could say you know we might raise more revenue or medical innovation will make the spending even higher it is a increasingly difficult picture even assuming the economy does quite well probably better than it will do this is is what you see at this overall level now why how did we get here I mean how could you have a problem like this after all there at least on paper there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced only one state says they don't have to balance the budget but what this means actually is that there's a pretense there's no real true balancing going on and in a sense the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don't see things that are actually pretty straightforward challenges when Jerry Brown was elected this was the challenge that was put to him that is through various gimmicks and things a so-called balanced budget had led him to have 25 billion missing out of the 76 billion in proposed spending now he's put together some thoughts about half of that he'll cut another half perhaps in a very complex set of steps taxes will be approved but even so as you go out into those future years various pension costs health costs go up enough and the revenue does not go up enough so you get a big squeeze what were those things that allowed us to hide this well some really nice little tricks and these were somewhat noticed the paper said it's not really balanced it's got holes it perpetuates deficit spending it's riddled with gimmicks and really when you get down to it the guys Enron never would have done this I mean this is so blatant so extreme you know is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do they borrow money they're not supposed to but they figure out a way they make you pay more withholding just helped their cash flow out they sell off the assets they defer the payments they sell off the revenues from tobacco in California is not unique impact there's about five states that are worse the only really four states that don't face this big challenge so it's systemic across the entire country it really comes from the fact that certain long-term obligations healthcare where innovation makes it more expensive early retirement and pension where the age structure gets worse for you and just generosity that these Mis accounting things allowed to develop over time that you've got a problem this is the retiree health care benefits 3 million set aside sixty two billion dollar liability much worse than the car companies and everybody looked at that knew that that was headed towards a huge problem the forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from twenty-six percent of the budget to forty two percent well what's going to give well in order to accommodate that you would have to cut education spending in half it really is this young versus the old to some degree if you don't change that revenue picture if you don't solve what you're doing in health care you're going to be D investing in the young the great University of California University System the great things that have gone on won't happen so far it's meant layoffs increased class sizes within the education community there's this discussion of should it just be the young teachers who get laid off or the less good teachers who get laid off and there's a discussion if you're going to increase class sizes where do you do that how much effect does that have and unfortunately as you get into that people get confused and think well maybe you think that's okay in fact no education spending should not be cut there's ways if it's temporary to minimize the impact but it's a problem it's also really a problem for where we need to go technology has a role to play well we need money to experiment with that to get those those tools in there there's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness measuring them giving them feedback taking videos in the classroom that's something I think is very very important Willie you have allocate dollars for that system and for the that incentive pay in a situation where we have growth you put the new money into this or even if you're flat you might shift money into it but with the type of cuts we're talking about it will be far far harder to get these incentives for excellence order to move over to use technology in the new way so what's going on where where's the brain trust that's in error here well there really is no brain trust it it's sort of the voter's it's sort of us showing up you know just look at this spinning California we'll spend over a hundred billion Microsoft thirty-eight Google about 19 the amount of IQ and good numeric analysis both inside Google and Microsoft and outside with analysts and people that there is opinions should they have spent on that now they wasted their money on this what about this thing it really is quite phenomenal you know everybody has an opinion that there's great great feedback and the numbers are used to make decision if you go over to the education spending the healthcare spending particularly to these long-term trends you don't have that type of involvement on a number that's more important in terms of equity in terms of learning so what do we need to do we need better tools we can get some things out on the internet I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture we need lots more there's a few good books one about school spending and where the money comes from how that's changed over time and the challenge we need better accounting we need to take the fact that the current employees the future liabilities they create that should come out of the current budget we need to understand why they've done the pension accounting the way they have it should be more like private accounting that's the gold standard and finally we need to really reward politicians whenever they say there's these long term problems we can't say oh you're the messenger with bad news we just shot you in fact there are some like these Erskine Bowles Alan Simpson and others who've gone through and given proposal for this overall federal health spending state-level problem but in fact their work sort of pushed off in fact the week afterwards some tax cuts were done that that made the situation even worse than their assumptions so we need these pieces and I think this is a solvable problem you know it's a great country with lots of people but we have to draw those people in because this is about education and just looked at what the tuitions happened with the University of California and project that out for another three four or five years it's unaffordable and that's what that's the kind of thing the investment in the young that makes us great allows us to contribute it allows us to do the art the biotechnology the software and all those those magic things and so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids in our future thank you [Applause] [Music] when I think about succeeding in business I think there's a couple of considerations first and foremost is teamwork today's problems are just too complicated to be solved as an individual and the opportunity to work with others collaboratively where you can build on each other's ideas I think is particularly important I think a second area that's quite important is the understanding of different disciplines it is critical that one be an expert in your major but it is absolutely essential that you have the ability to understand where other disciplines the input from other disciplines and be able to incorporate that to make effective decisions and then last but not least we are in a global business community and so the opportunity to understand cultures different cultures around the world to be able to incorporate some of the learning from those cultures and to incorporate that into your business decisions is essential to success I have three degrees from Cornell so I'd say just about everything that has prepared me came from Cornell and I am indebted to the University for that experience but as I think particularly about my business school career I think the exposure to a variety of disciplines the wealth of resources across the university we're exceptionally helpful

say there's these long term problems we can't say oh you're the messenger with bad news we just shot you in fact there are some like these Erskine Bowles Alan Simpson and others who've gone through and given proposal for this overall federal health spending state-level problem but in fact their work sort of pushed off in fact the week afterwards some tax cuts were done that that made the situation even worse than their assumptions so we need these pieces and I think this is a solvable problem you know it's a great country with lots of people but we have to draw those people in because this is about education and just looked at what the tuitions happened with the University of California and project that out for another three four or five years it's unaffordable and that's what that's the kind of thing the investment in the young that makes us great allows us to contribute it allows us to do the art the biotechnology the software and all those those magic things and so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids in our future thank you [Applause] [Music] when I think about succeeding in business I think there's a couple of considerations first and foremost is teamwork today's problems are just too complicated to be solved as an individual and the opportunity to work with others collaboratively where you can build on each other's ideas I think is particularly important I think a second area that's quite important is the understanding of different disciplines it is critical that one be an expert in your major but it is absolutely essential that you have the ability to understand where other disciplines the input from other disciplines and be able to incorporate that to make effective decisions and then last but not least we are in a global business community and so the opportunity to understand cultures different cultures around the world to be able to incorporate some of the learning from those cultures and to incorporate that into your business decisions is essential to success I have three degrees from Cornell so I'd say just about everything that has prepared me came from Cornell and I am indebted to the University for that experience but as I think particularly about my business school career I think the exposure to a variety of disciplines the wealth of resources across the university we're exceptionally helpful

**Transcript**:
[Music] do you worry about what is going to kill you heart disease cancer a car accident most of us worry about things we can't control like war terrorism the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti but what really threatens humanity a few years ago professor Vaclav SMIL tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history he called these massively fatal discontinuities meaning that they could kill up to a hundred million people in the next 50 years he looked at the odds of another world war of a massive volcanic eruption even if an asteroid hitting the earth but he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to a hundred percent and that is a severe flu pandemic now you might think of flu as just a really bad cold but it can be a death sentence every year 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu in the developing world the data is much sketch here but the death toll is almost certainly higher you know the problem is is that this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic in 1918 a new virus appeared that killed some fifty to a hundred million people it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms are we safer today well we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared but this threat could reappear at any time the good news is that we're at a moment in time when science technology globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth we can do this we're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines and if we get these to more people we can certainly save more lives but with new or better vaccines for malaria TB HIV pneumonia diarrhea flu we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time so I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you but first I have to explain why they're important because vaccines the power of them is really like a whisper when they work they can make history but after a while you can barely hear them now some of us are old enough to have a small circular scar on her arms from an inoculation we received as children but when was the last time you worried about smallpox a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us or polio how many of you remember the iron lung we don't see scenes like this anymore because the vaccines now you know it's interesting because there are 30 odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu why is that well here's the dirty little secret until recently we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked we knew they work through old-fashioned trial and error you took a pathogen you modified it you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened this worked well for most pathogens somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu but not at all for HIV which humans have no natural immunity so let's explore how vaccines work they basically create a catch of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed now when you get a viral infection what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength and that might be too late when you're pre immunized what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes so that's really how vaccines work now let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at Ted for the first time on how an effective HIV vaccine might work a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader after HIV penetrates the body's new coastal barriers it infects immune cells to replicate the invader draws the attention of the immune systems frontline troops dendritic cells or macrophages capture the virus and display pieces of it memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the frontline troops these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed memory b-cells turn into plasma cells which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch on to HIV to prevent it from infecting cells while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected the virus is defeated without a vaccine these responses would have taken more than a week by that time the battle against HIV would already have been lost [Music] really cool video isn't it the antibodies that you just saw in this video in action are the ones that make most vaccines work so the real question that is how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV the principle challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing so let's take a look at the flu virus in this rendering of the flu virus these different color spikes or what it uses to infect you and also what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus when these mutate they change their shape and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore so that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu it's also why in the spring we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall even worse the common most common influenza influenza A also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans and they can recombine in those particular animals in addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza so you've got this situation in 2003 we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated case with an apparent mortality rate of 70% now you know luckily that particular virus although very scary at the time did not transmit from person to person very easily this year's h1n1 threat was actually a human avian swine mixture that arose in Mexico it was easily transmitted but luckily was pretty mild and so in a sense our luck is holding out but you know another wild bird could fly over at any time now let's take a look at HIV as variable as flu is HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibralter the virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogens scientists have ever confronted it mutates furiously it has decoys to evade the immune system it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV a much wilder target in the video a moment ago you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells now realize that in a recently infected person there are millions of these ships each one is just slightly different finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder now in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together these drugs are in cures but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV at least for those who can access them the vaccine effort though is really quite different large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine but today evidence tells us otherwise in September we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand for the first time we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans albeit quite modestly and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago newer concepts in early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models but in the past few months researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of HIV infected individual now what does this mean we saw earlier that HIV is highly variable that a broadly neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of iris if you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models they provide full protection from infection in addition these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab on to and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates it's like as many times as the virus changes its clothes it's still wearing the same socks and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks so what we've got is a situation the tie results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that this strategy working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate has never been done before in vaccine research it's called retro vaccinology and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV so think of it this way we've got these new antibodies we've identified and we know that they latch on to many many variations of the virus we know that they have to latch on to a specific part so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part present that through a vaccine what we hoped is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies and that would create a universal HIV vaccine now it sounds easier it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site and as you can imagine these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this we'd love to hear about it but you know the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases so for instance a biotechnology company has now found royal neutralizing antibodies to influenza as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus they're currently making a cocktail in antibody cocktail that can be used to treat severe overwhelming cases of flu now in the longer term what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine now retro vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design let me give you another example we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus notice these other smaller protuberances these are largely hidden from the immune system now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates if you can these with specific antibodies you could all versions of the flu so far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease although might get a mild case so if this works in humans what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death we really could think of flu then as just a bad cold of course the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it so to do that we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and of course smart delivery methods so I want you to think back a few months ago in June the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years the US government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by October 15 for the flu peak vaccines were promised to developing countries hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing so what happened well we first figured out how to make flu vaccines how to produce them in the early 1940s it was a slow cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs millions of living chicken eggs viruses only grow in living things and so it turned out that for flu chicken eggs worked really well for most strains you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg luckily for us we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances so today we get our flu vaccines from chicken eggs hundreds of millions of chicken eggs you know almost nothing has changed you know the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow this year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production basically point six doses per egg so here's an alarming thought what if that wild bird flies by again you could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines so Dan if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm I know where to get them so right now the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu but this assumes that our factories are humming because in 2004 the US supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant and the process still takes more than half a year so are we better prepared than we were in 1918 well the new technology is emerging now I hope we can say definitively yes imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States with a range of new technologies we could here's an example a company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system if you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium which creates a vigorous immune response they've created a very powerful flu fighter this vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria e.coli now as you know bacteria reproduce quickly it's like making yogurt and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories in a few weeks with no eggs for a fraction of the cost of current methods so here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies and aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings for an example the e.coli method I just talked about look at the time save this would be live saved the developing world mostly left out of the current response sees the potential of these alternate technologies and their leap frogging the West India Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap billions of people can have access to life-saving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them now think of where this leads us new infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years someday perhaps soon we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us will we be quick enough to react before millions die luckily this year's flu was relatively mild I say luckily in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated so if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments we will master these and new tools of X and ology and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives no longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year no longer does aids need to kill 2 million a year no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases or indeed anybody instead of having vacuous meals massively fatal discontinuity of life we can ensure the continuity of life what the world needs now are these new vaccines and we can make it happen thank you very much thank you so thank you so the science is changing in your mind Seth I mean you you must dream about this what is the kind of timescale on let's start with HIV for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable the game change can come in at any time because this is the problem we have now as we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans we just need a better one and with these types of annuals we know humans can make them so if we can figure out how to do that then we have the vaccine and what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're being to crack that problem so the challenge is full speed and your gut do you think it's probably gonna be at least another five years you know that everybody says it's ten years but it's been ten years every ten years so I hate to put I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends and that's the same with universal flu vaccine the same kind of thing I think flu is different I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch of Tigers shown some of there's a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now they look good the problem has been that what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that's what we were comfortable with you also can use adjuvant which are chemicals you mix that's what Europe is doing so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available but going back to what mike respector said you know the anti vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen and malaria is even further behind all no malaria there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in Phase three trials now it probably isn't the perfect vaccine but it's moving along sothe myths let's do work where every month we kind of you know we produce something we get that kind of gratification you've been slaving away at this for more than a decade and I just you know I salute you and your colleagues for what you do the world needs people like you thank you thank you you

smaller protuberances these are largely hidden from the immune system now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates if you can these with specific antibodies you could all versions of the flu so far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease although might get a mild case so if this works in humans what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death we really could think of flu then as just a bad cold of course the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it so to do that we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and of course smart delivery methods so I want you to think back a few months ago in June the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years the US government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by October 15 for the flu peak vaccines were promised to developing countries hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing so what happened well we first figured out how to make flu vaccines how to produce them in the early 1940s it was a slow cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs millions of living chicken eggs viruses only grow in living things and so it turned out that for flu chicken eggs worked really well for most strains you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg luckily for us we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances so today we get our flu vaccines from chicken eggs hundreds of millions of chicken eggs you know almost nothing has changed you know the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow this year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production basically point six doses per egg so here's an alarming thought what if that wild bird flies by again you could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines so Dan if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm I know where to get them so right now the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu but this assumes that our factories are humming because in 2004 the US supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant and the process still takes more than half a year so are we better prepared than we were in 1918 well the new technology is emerging now I hope we can say definitively yes imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States with a range of new technologies we could here's an example a company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system if you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium which creates a vigorous immune response they've created a very powerful flu fighter this vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria e.coli now as you know bacteria reproduce quickly it's like making yogurt and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories in a few weeks with no eggs for a fraction of the cost of current methods so here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies and aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings for an example the e.coli method I just talked about look at the time save this would be live saved the developing world mostly left out of the current response sees the potential of these alternate technologies and their leap frogging the West India Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap billions of people can have access to life-saving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them now think of where this leads us new infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years someday perhaps soon we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us will we be quick enough to react before millions die luckily this year's flu was relatively mild I say luckily in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated so if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments we will master these and new tools of X and ology and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives no longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year no longer does aids need to kill 2 million a year no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases or indeed anybody instead of having vacuous meals massively fatal discontinuity of life we can ensure the continuity of life what the world needs now are these new vaccines and we can make it happen thank you very much thank you so thank you so the science is changing in your mind Seth I mean you you must dream about this what is the kind of timescale on let's start with HIV for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable the game change can come in at any time because this is the problem we have now as we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans we just need a better one and with these types of annuals we know humans can make them so if we can figure out how to do that then we have the vaccine and what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're being to crack that problem so the challenge is full speed and your gut do you think it's probably gonna be at least another five years you know that everybody says it's ten years but it's been ten years every ten years so I hate to put I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends and that's the same with universal flu vaccine the same kind of thing I think flu is different I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch of Tigers shown some of there's a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now they look good the problem has been that what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that's what we were comfortable with you also can use adjuvant which are chemicals you mix that's what Europe is doing so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available but going back to what mike respector said you know the anti vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen and malaria is even further behind all no malaria there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in Phase three trials now it probably isn't the perfect vaccine but it's moving along sothe myths let's do work where every month we kind of you know we produce something we get that kind of gratification you've been slaving away at this for more than a decade and I just you know I salute you and your colleagues for what you do the world needs people like you thank you thank you you

**Transcript**:
[Music] do you worry about what is going to kill you heart disease cancer a car accident most of us worry about things we can't control like war terrorism the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti but what really threatens humanity a few years ago professor Vaclav SMIL tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history he called these massively fatal discontinuities meaning that they could kill up to a hundred million people in the next 50 years he looked at the odds of another world war of a massive volcanic eruption even if an asteroid hitting the earth but he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to a hundred percent and that is a severe flu pandemic now you might think of flu as just a really bad cold but it can be a death sentence every year 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu in the developing world the data is much sketch here but the death toll is almost certainly higher you know the problem is is that this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic in 1918 a new virus appeared that killed some fifty to a hundred million people it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms are we safer today well we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared but this threat could reappear at any time the good news is that we're at a moment in time when science technology globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth we can do this we're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines and if we get these to more people we can certainly save more lives but with new or better vaccines for malaria TB HIV pneumonia diarrhea flu we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time so I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you but first I have to explain why they're important because vaccines the power of them is really like a whisper when they work they can make history but after a while you can barely hear them now some of us are old enough to have a small circular scar on her arms from an inoculation we received as children but when was the last time you worried about smallpox a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us or polio how many of you remember the iron lung we don't see scenes like this anymore because the vaccines now you know it's interesting because there are 30 odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu why is that well here's the dirty little secret until recently we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked we knew they work through old-fashioned trial and error you took a pathogen you modified it you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened this worked well for most pathogens somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu but not at all for HIV which humans have no natural immunity so let's explore how vaccines work they basically create a catch of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed now when you get a viral infection what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength and that might be too late when you're pre immunized what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes so that's really how vaccines work now let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at Ted for the first time on how an effective HIV vaccine might work a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader after HIV penetrates the body's new coastal barriers it infects immune cells to replicate the invader draws the attention of the immune systems frontline troops dendritic cells or macrophages capture the virus and display pieces of it memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the frontline troops these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed memory b-cells turn into plasma cells which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch on to HIV to prevent it from infecting cells while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected the virus is defeated without a vaccine these responses would have taken more than a week by that time the battle against HIV would already have been lost [Music] really cool video isn't it the antibodies that you just saw in this video in action are the ones that make most vaccines work so the real question that is how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV the principle challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing so let's take a look at the flu virus in this rendering of the flu virus these different color spikes or what it uses to infect you and also what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus when these mutate they change their shape and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore so that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu it's also why in the spring we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall even worse the common most common influenza influenza A also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans and they can recombine in those particular animals in addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza so you've got this situation in 2003 we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated case with an apparent mortality rate of 70% now you know luckily that particular virus although very scary at the time did not transmit from person to person very easily this year's h1n1 threat was actually a human avian swine mixture that arose in Mexico it was easily transmitted but luckily was pretty mild and so in a sense our luck is holding out but you know another wild bird could fly over at any time now let's take a look at HIV as variable as flu is HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibralter the virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogens scientists have ever confronted it mutates furiously it has decoys to evade the immune system it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV a much wilder target in the video a moment ago you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells now realize that in a recently infected person there are millions of these ships each one is just slightly different finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder now in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together these drugs are in cures but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV at least for those who can access them the vaccine effort though is really quite different large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine but today evidence tells us otherwise in September we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand for the first time we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans albeit quite modestly and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago newer concepts in early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models but in the past few months researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of HIV infected individual now what does this mean we saw earlier that HIV is highly variable that a broadly neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of iris if you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models they provide full protection from infection in addition these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab on to and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates it's like as many times as the virus changes its clothes it's still wearing the same socks and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks so what we've got is a situation the tie results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that this strategy working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate has never been done before in vaccine research it's called retro vaccinology and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV so think of it this way we've got these new antibodies we've identified and we know that they latch on to many many variations of the virus we know that they have to latch on to a specific part so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part present that through a vaccine what we hoped is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies and that would create a universal HIV vaccine now it sounds easier it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site and as you can imagine these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this we'd love to hear about it but you know the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases so for instance a biotechnology company has now found royal neutralizing antibodies to influenza as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus they're currently making a cocktail in antibody cocktail that can be used to treat severe overwhelming cases of flu now in the longer term what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine now retro vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design let me give you another example we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus notice these other smaller protuberances these are largely hidden from the immune system now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates if you can these with specific antibodies you could all versions of the flu so far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease although might get a mild case so if this works in humans what we're talking about is a

changing so let's take a look at the flu virus in this rendering of the flu virus these different color spikes or what it uses to infect you and also what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus when these mutate they change their shape and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore so that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu it's also why in the spring we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall even worse the common most common influenza influenza A also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans and they can recombine in those particular animals in addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza so you've got this situation in 2003 we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated case with an apparent mortality rate of 70% now you know luckily that particular virus although very scary at the time did not transmit from person to person very easily this year's h1n1 threat was actually a human avian swine mixture that arose in Mexico it was easily transmitted but luckily was pretty mild and so in a sense our luck is holding out but you know another wild bird could fly over at any time now let's take a look at HIV as variable as flu is HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibralter the virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogens scientists have ever confronted it mutates furiously it has decoys to evade the immune system it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV a much wilder target in the video a moment ago you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells now realize that in a recently infected person there are millions of these ships each one is just slightly different finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder now in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS we've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together these drugs are in cures but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV at least for those who can access them the vaccine effort though is really quite different large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine but today evidence tells us otherwise in September we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand for the first time we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans albeit quite modestly and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago newer concepts in early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models but in the past few months researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of HIV infected individual now what does this mean we saw earlier that HIV is highly variable that a broadly neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of iris if you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models they provide full protection from infection in addition these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab on to and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates it's like as many times as the virus changes its clothes it's still wearing the same socks and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks so what we've got is a situation the tie results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that this strategy working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate has never been done before in vaccine research it's called retro vaccinology and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV so think of it this way we've got these new antibodies we've identified and we know that they latch on to many many variations of the virus we know that they have to latch on to a specific part so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part present that through a vaccine what we hoped is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies and that would create a universal HIV vaccine now it sounds easier it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site and as you can imagine these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this we'd love to hear about it but you know the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases so for instance a biotechnology company has now found royal neutralizing antibodies to influenza as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus they're currently making a cocktail in antibody cocktail that can be used to treat severe overwhelming cases of flu now in the longer term what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine now retro vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design let me give you another example we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus notice these other smaller protuberances these are largely hidden from the immune system now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates if you can these with specific antibodies you could all versions of the flu so far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease although might get a mild case so if this works in humans what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death we really could think of flu then as just a bad cold of course the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it so to do that we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and of course smart delivery methods so I want you to think back a few months ago in June the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years the US government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by October 15 for the flu peak vaccines were promised to developing countries hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing so what happened well we first figured out how to make flu vaccines how to produce them in the early 1940s it was a slow cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs millions of living chicken eggs viruses only grow in living things and so it turned out that for flu chicken eggs worked really well for most strains you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg luckily for us we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances so today we get our flu vaccines from chicken eggs hundreds of millions of chicken eggs you know almost nothing has changed you know the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow this year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production basically point six doses per egg so here's an alarming thought what if that wild bird flies by again you could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines so Dan if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm I know where to get them so right now the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu but this assumes that our factories are humming because in 2004 the US supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant and the process still takes more than half a year so are we better prepared than we were in 1918 well the new technology is emerging now I hope we can say definitively yes imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States with a range of new technologies we could here's an example a company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system if you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium which creates a vigorous immune response they've created a very powerful flu fighter this vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria e.coli now as you know bacteria reproduce quickly it's like making yogurt and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories in a few weeks with no eggs for a fraction of the cost of current methods so here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies and aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings for an example the e.coli method I just talked about look at the time save this would be live saved the developing world mostly left out of the current response sees the potential of these alternate technologies and their leap frogging the West India Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap billions of people can have access to life-saving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them now think of where this leads us new infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years someday perhaps soon we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us will we be quick enough to react before millions die luckily this year's flu was relatively mild I say luckily in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated so if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments we will master these and new tools of X and ology and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives no longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year no longer does aids need to kill 2 million a year no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases or indeed anybody instead of having vacuous meals massively fatal discontinuity of life we can ensure the continuity of life what the world needs now are these new vaccines and we can make it happen thank you very much thank you so thank you so the science is changing in your mind Seth I mean you you must dream about this what is the kind of timescale on let's start with HIV for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable the game change can come in at any time because this is the problem we have now as we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans we just need a better one and with these types of annuals we know humans can make them so if we can figure out how to do that then we have the vaccine and what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're being to crack that problem so the challenge is full speed and your gut do you think it's probably gonna be at least another five years you know that everybody says it's ten years but it's been ten years every ten years so I hate to put I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends and that's the same with universal flu vaccine the same kind of thing I think flu is different I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch of Tigers shown some of there's a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now they look good the problem has been that what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that's what we were comfortable with you also can use adjuvant which are chemicals you mix that's what Europe is doing so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available but going back to what mike respector said you know the anti vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen and malaria is even further behind all no malaria there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in Phase three trials now it probably isn't the perfect vaccine but it's moving along sothe myths let's do work where every month we kind of you know we produce something we get that kind of gratification you've been slaving away at this for more than a decade and I just you know I salute you and your colleagues for what you do the world needs people like you thank you thank you you

**Transcript**:
[Music] do you worry about what is going to kill you heart disease cancer a car accident most of us worry about things we can't control like war terrorism the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti but what really threatens humanity a few years ago professor Vaclav SMIL tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history he called these massively fatal discontinuities meaning that they could kill up to a hundred million people in the next 50 years he looked at the odds of another world war of a massive volcanic eruption even if an asteroid hitting the earth but he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to a hundred percent and that is a severe flu pandemic now you might think of flu as just a really bad cold but it can be a death sentence every year 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu in the developing world the data is much sketch here but the death toll is almost certainly higher you know the problem is is that this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic in 1918 a new virus appeared that killed some fifty to a hundred million people it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms are we safer today well we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared but this threat could reappear at any time the good news is that we're at a moment in time when science technology globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth we can do this we're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines and if we get these to more people we can certainly save more lives but with new or better vaccines for malaria TB HIV pneumonia diarrhea flu we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time so I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you but first I have to explain why they're important because vaccines the power of them is really like a whisper when they work they can make history but after a while you can barely hear them now some of us are old enough to have a small circular scar on her arms from an inoculation we received as children but when was the last time you worried about smallpox a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us or polio how many of you remember the iron lung we don't see scenes like this anymore because the vaccines now you know it's interesting because there are 30 odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu why is that well here's the dirty little secret until recently we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked we knew they work through old-fashioned trial and error you took a pathogen you modified it you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened this worked well for most pathogens somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu but not at all for HIV which humans have no natural immunity so let's explore how vaccines work they basically create a catch of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed now when you get a viral infection what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength and that might be too late when you're pre immunized what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes so that's really how vaccines work now let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at Ted for the first time on how an effective HIV vaccine might work a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader after HIV penetrates the body's new coastal barriers it infects immune cells to replicate the invader draws the attention of the immune systems frontline troops dendritic cells or macrophages capture the virus and display pieces of it memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the frontline troops these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed memory b-cells turn into plasma cells which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch on to HIV to prevent it from infecting cells while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected the virus is defeated without a vaccine these responses would have taken more than a week by that time the battle against HIV would already have been lost [Music] really cool video isn't it the antibodies that you just saw in this video in action are the ones that make most vaccines work so the real question that is how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV the principle challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing so let's take a look at the flu virus in this rendering of the flu virus these different color spikes or what it uses to infect you and also what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus when these mutate they change their shape and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore so that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu it's also why in the spring we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall even worse the common most common influenza influenza A also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans and they can recombine in those particular animals in addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza so you've got this situation in 2003 we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated case with an apparent mortality rate of 70% now you

saying you never think wide at the beginning of anything whether it's your career or a problem you're trying to solve you got to think wide you got to take lots of stuff in and I say when you're young don't Focus too soon just know in the back of your mind that success requires a single-minded focus as Larry p co-founder Google said to me you should focus on one important goal and you need to be pretty single-minded about it it was a single-minded focus that enabled astrophysicists to build a space telescope the size of a of a suitcase that only cost 10 million bucks compared to the two billion it cost to build the Hubble and when I asked Mission scientist Jamie Matthews about it he said focus is the key word for our success we pulled this off on a tight budget and short timeline because we just did one thing thing exceptionally well we didn't try and make the Swiss army knife of telescopes that did a lot of things successful companies focus when Tom Monahan the founder of Domino's Pizza was asked the The Secret of his success he set a fanatical focus on doing one thing well Bill Gates would agree he says if you want to be a great software company you have to be only a software company you can't dabble in other things but many companies and people do dabble and I was one of them after 10 years in the workforce I was dabbling in many different areas and on the personal front I was all over the map so I was okay at a lot of things but I wasn't great at any one thing and when I looked at successful people it was just the opposite they're not great at everything they're only great at one thing Quincy Jones told me he can't even drive a car because he's focused his whole life on making great music and that's what made him great so I figured I had to focus and become an expert at something so I cut out all the dabbling of focused only on photography I became a successful advertising photographer and I even won Top Awards in both photography and video so I discovered Focus really does pay off in addition to long-term Focus there's also short-term concentration just being able to put our heads down and get something done right now Jennifer

minimum wage in a 7-Eleven store then he developed Yuri systems sold it to Lucent personally made 500 million cash and became president of Lucen Technologies and he said concentration had a lot to do

wonder we can we can concentrate for 5 seconds before something warbles beeps vibrates or plays somebody's favorite tune but the trick is to eliminate the distractions when we need to concentrate best-selling author Stephen King says if you want to be a writer there should be no phone in your writing room no TV no video games draw the curtains eliminate every possible distraction and by doing that he became one of the world's most popular writers and remember Warren Buffett became one of the world's richest men by living in a constant state of no distractions it's called Nebraska he says

[Music] eight to be great the eight traits successful people have in common number three focus when I asked James Cameron how he managed to produce the two highest grossing films of all time Titanic and Avatar he said Focus had a lot to do with it he said you've got to be super focused like a laser to get anything worthwhile done he said when I did Avatar I was focused for four years now I'm not saying you never think wide at the beginning of anything whether it's your career or a problem you're trying to solve you got to think wide you got to take lots of stuff in and I say when you're young don't Focus too soon just know in the back of your mind that success requires a single-minded focus as Larry p co-founder Google said to me you should focus on one important goal and you need to be pretty single-minded about it it was a single-minded focus that enabled astrophysicists to build a space telescope the size of a of a suitcase that only cost 10 million bucks compared to the two billion it cost to build the Hubble and when I asked Mission scientist Jamie Matthews about it he said focus is the key word for our success we pulled this off on a tight budget and short timeline because we just did one thing thing exceptionally well we didn't try and make the Swiss army knife of telescopes that did a lot of things successful companies focus when Tom Monahan the founder of Domino's Pizza was asked the The Secret of his success he set a fanatical focus on doing one thing well Bill Gates would agree he says if you want to be a great software company you have to be only a software company you can't dabble in other things but many companies and people do dabble and I was one of them after 10 years in the workforce I was dabbling in many different areas and on the personal front I was all over the map so I was okay at a lot of things but I wasn't great at any one thing and when I looked at successful people it was just the opposite they're not great at everything they're only great at one thing Quincy Jones told me he can't even drive a car because he's focused his whole life on making great music and that's what made him great so I figured I had to focus and become an expert at something so I cut out all the dabbling of focused only on photography I became a successful advertising photographer and I even won Top Awards in both photography and video so I discovered Focus really does pay off in addition to long-term Focus there's also short-term concentration just being able to put our heads down and get something done right now Jennifer Mather a famous animal behavior says I have a ferocious ability to concentrate I can say I'm going to do this and close the rest of the world off concentration helped yon Kim succeed he was working at minimum wage in a 7-Eleven store then he developed Yuri systems sold it to Lucent personally made 500 million cash and became president of Lucen Technologies and he said concentration had a lot to do with it he said I can work day and night and maintain the concentration without getting burned out so concentration is a valuable skill to develop and it's not easy to develop when there's so many distractions out there and scientists are developing new ones all the time although it's not easy cuz they keep getting distracted now with emails mobile phones and all the stuff on the web it's a wonder we can we can concentrate for 5 seconds before something warbles beeps vibrates or plays somebody's favorite tune but the trick is to eliminate the distractions when we need to concentrate best-selling author Stephen King says if you want to be a writer there should be no phone in your writing room no TV no video games draw the curtains eliminate every possible distraction and by doing that he became one of the world's most popular writers and remember Warren Buffett became one of the world's richest men by living in a constant state of no distractions it's called Nebraska he says when I worked back in New York there were more stimuli hitting me all the time it's much easier to think here and I wonder if that isn't one of the big reasons why so many successful people I interview actually grew up in small towns not big cities fewer dist ractions more ability to focus and concentrate but now all that's going to change cuz with the internet we can be in the middle of nowhere and still be distracted and concentration doesn't always mean being in a quiet room or alone many people actually use noise to eliminate distractions Stephen King does remember he's the guy who said eliminate every possible distraction but he also says I work to loud music for me the music is just another way of shutting the door John silly Brown also uses noise to eliminate distractions he's Chief scientist at Xerox and he said to me I did my doctoral thesis in a bar because I love the noise I could concentrate even with the noise All Around Me geez I thought all those people in bars were partying now it turns out they could be phds and learning how to concentrate is all about practice practice practice Lindsey Sharp heads up four museums in London and he said to me it's very hard to concentrate so you have to practice a lot he said I learned how to study in the middle of an airport so now if I'm concentrating and there's a siren outside I don't even hear it the bottom line Focus helps us succeed whether it's long-term Focus or shortterm [Applause] concentration

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I'm going to take you on a journey into some hidden worlds inside your own body using the scanning electron microscope. These microscopes use a beam of electrons to illuminate things that are too small to be seen by the photons of visible light. And to put this in context, if you mentally divide one tiny millimeter into a thousand parts, each one of those parts is a micrometer, or micron for short. If you then divide one micron into another thousand parts, each one of those is a nanometer. And it's nanometers and microns that are the domain of the scanning electron microscope. So, let's start with something on the body that we can measure at about 100 microns wide, and that would be a human hair, which now you can see is covered with scales, just like all of our hairs, and in fact, just like all mammal hairs. We're going to plunge into the body now, and we've landed in the thyroid gland. Here we're looking at proteins that are being secreted into a storage chamber where they are going to develop into the mature thyroid hormones before being released into the body. And at this point you might be wondering if these colors are real. The answer is no. Electron images only happen in black and white. I often colorize my images for various reasons, but I don't change the structures, so the strucutres that you're seeing are all exactly as they were when I photographed them in the microscope. We're going to take a detour and zoom in on the heart muscle now. And the heart muscle has this curious structure that's kind of like corrugated cardboard. That's what allows the heart to expand and contract as it's beating. Let's go look at a lung with pneumonia. Here we've got a white blood cell poking around in an air sac, looking for something to clean out like a little vacuum cleaner. This is your immune systems at work. So what are the kinds of things that we don't want to be breathing, besides bacteria and viruses? Well, we all know to stay away from asbestos and now we can see why. This is a close-up view of the mineral that asbestos is made from, and now you can see that it's composed of many tiny, fine little needles. Each one of those needles is a single crystal. And in this picture, they're begininng to pry apart and tangle up into a spiky mess, not for breathing. What else might we want to avoid breathing? Well, how about diesel fuel? We're looking here at the particles of diesel soot, and these are extraordinarily tiny. In fact, each one of these little particles is only about 50 nanometers wide. We'll go and look at some blood now. We've got a collection of nice, fat, happy, healthy red blood cells, but they're all tangled up in a network of fibers. This is how the body makes a blood clot. And so, it surrounds a group of red blood cells and other cells, and traps them so the blood can't flow. We've got two more blood cells here, but they're not normal like the ones in the blood clot image. These are distorted. You can see that they're curling up and beginning to grow what's going to become spikes. These are sickle cells and these are what cause the condition of sickle cell amenia. We've gone into the mouth now and we've landed on dental plague, which you can see is covered with bacteria, and in fact dental plague is host to about 1,000 different species of bacteria. Lovely to think about. And now we are on to other teeth. We're on the surfaces of the, or the internal surfaces of the teeth themselves. The smaller one is a baby tooth that had just fallen out of the mouth of a young friend of mine, and I want to call your attention to the little holes. Those little holes are the tops of a whole network of tiny little tubes that circulate nourishing fluids inside your teeth. And we can see those tubes a little better in the larger picture because some of them are in cross-section. But in fact, this larger picture is showing you a portion of a tusk, which you may know is simply a great big, elongated tooth, so you would expect to see the same features between your teeth and a tusk. But that larger tusk picture is also rough by comparison to the young baby tooth. That's because it's many, many thousands of years old. It's also partly fossilized. And, between these two pictures, now you can see how your teeth relate to the tusk of an Ice Age mammoth. We're shooting up north now into the brain, and we can see these pink cells down at the bottom. Those are the neurons of memory. And I'm going to leave you with this picture because I know you're going to take a lot of happy memories away from your exciting day at TED and now you can visualize where those memories are being stored in your own brain. Thank you.

So, let's start with something on the body that we can measure at about 100 microns wide, and that would be a human hair, which now you can see is covered with scales, just like all of our hairs, and in fact, just like all mammal hairs. We're going to plunge into the body now, and we've landed in the thyroid gland. Here we're looking at proteins that are being secreted into a storage chamber where they are going to develop into the mature thyroid hormones before being released into the body. And at this point you might be wondering if these colors are real. The answer is no. Electron images only happen in black and white. I often colorize my images for various reasons, but I don't change the structures, so the strucutres that you're seeing are all exactly as they were when I photographed them in the microscope. We're going to take a detour and zoom in on the heart muscle now. And the heart muscle has this curious structure that's kind of like corrugated cardboard. That's what allows the heart to expand and contract as it's beating. Let's go look at a lung with pneumonia. Here we've got a white blood cell poking around in an air sac, looking for something to clean out like a little vacuum cleaner. This is your immune systems at work. So what are the kinds of things that we don't want to be breathing, besides bacteria and viruses? Well, we all know to stay away from asbestos and now we can see why. This is a close-up view of the mineral that asbestos is made from, and now you can see that it's composed of many tiny, fine little needles. Each one of those needles is a single crystal. And in this picture, they're begininng to pry apart and tangle up into a spiky mess, not for breathing. What else might we want to avoid breathing? Well, how about diesel fuel? We're looking here at the particles of diesel soot, and these are extraordinarily tiny. In fact, each one of these little particles is only about 50 nanometers wide. We'll go and look at some blood now. We've got a collection of nice, fat, happy, healthy red blood cells, but they're all tangled up in a network of fibers. This is how the body makes a blood clot. And so, it surrounds a group of red blood cells and other cells, and traps them so the blood can't flow. We've got two more blood cells here, but they're not normal like the ones in the blood clot image. These are distorted. You can see that they're curling up and beginning to grow what's going to become spikes. These are sickle cells and these are what cause the condition of sickle cell amenia. We've gone into the mouth now and we've landed on dental plague, which you can see is covered with bacteria, and in fact dental plague is host to about 1,000 different species of bacteria. Lovely to think about. And now we are on to other teeth. We're on the surfaces of the, or the internal surfaces of the teeth themselves. The smaller one is a baby tooth that had just fallen out of the mouth of a young friend of mine, and I want to call your attention to the little holes. Those little holes are the tops of a whole network of tiny little tubes that circulate nourishing fluids inside your teeth. And we can see those tubes a little better in the larger picture because some of them are in cross-section. But in fact, this larger picture is showing you a portion of a tusk, which you may know is simply a great big, elongated tooth, so you would expect to see the same features between your teeth and a tusk. But that larger tusk picture is also rough by comparison to the young baby tooth. That's because it's many, many thousands of years old. It's also partly fossilized. And, between these two pictures, now you can see how your teeth relate to the tusk of an Ice Age mammoth. We're shooting up north now into the brain, and we can see these pink cells down at the bottom. Those are the neurons of memory. And I'm going to leave you with this picture because I know you're going to take a lot of happy memories away from your exciting day at TED and now you can visualize where those memories are being stored in your own brain. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so sometimes I get invited to give weird talks uh I got invited to speak to the people who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes to perform at sporting events unfortunately I I couldn't go but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys at least most of them know what it is that they do for a living what they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events shortly after that I got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals and again I couldn't go but it's a fascinating group they make balloon animals there's a big Schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals but they do a lot of really cool stuff with sometimes they get in trouble but not often and the other thing about these guys is they also know what they do for a living they make balloon animals but what do we do for a living what exactly do the people watching this do every day and I want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything that we try to find a piece of the status quo something that bothers us something that needs to be improved something that's itching to be changed and we change it and we try to make big permanent important change but we don't think about it that way and we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like and I've been studying it for a couple years and I want to share a couple stories with you today first about a guy named Nathan winegrad Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA and what you may not know about the history of the sbca is it was founded to kill dogs and cats cities gave them a charter to get rid of the Stray animals on the street and Destroy them and in a typical year 4 million dogs and cats were killed most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off the street Nathan and his boss saw this and they could not tolerate it so they set out to make San Francisco a no kill City create an entire city where every dog and cat unless it was Ill or dangerous would be adopted did not killed and everyone said it was impossible Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance and people from s SPCA and Humane shelters from around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane they persisted and Nathan went directly to the community he connected with people who cared about this nonprofessionals people with passion and within just a couple years San Francisco became the first no kill City running no deficit completely supported by the community Nathan left and went to Tomkins County New York a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States and he did it again he went from being a glorified dog catcher to completely transforming the community and then he went to North Carolina and did it again and he went to Reno and he did it again and when I think about what Nathan did and when I think about people here do I think about ideas and I think about the idea that creating an idea spreading an idea has a lot behind it and I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding but what they do is they take a light bulb and um They smash it now there's a bunch of reasons for that and stories about it but one reason is because it indicates a change from before to after it's a moment in time and I want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented we started with the factory idea that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient Factory that could turn out change we then went to the TV idea that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece if you could get on TV enough times if you could buy enough ads you could win and now we're in this new model of leadership where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system but by Leading so let me talk about the three Cycles the first one is the factory cycle Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea it enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay him $5 a day because he's got an efficient enough Factory well with that sort of Advantage you can churn out a lot of cars you can make a lot of change you can get roads built you can change the fabric of an entire country that the essence of what you're doing is you need ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines and the problem we've run into is we're running out of both ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines so we shift gears for a minute and say I know television avertising push push take a good idea and push it on the world I have a better mouse trap and if I can just get enough money to tell enough people I'll sell enough and you can build an entire industry on that if necessary you can put babies in your ads if necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff and if babies don't work you can use doctors but be careful because you don't want to get an unfortunate Dr to position when you're talking about one thing instead of the other this model requires you to act like the the king like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back that you are in charge and you're going to tell people what to do next that you know the quick little diagram of it is you're up here and you are pushing it out to the world this Method mass marketing requires average ideas because you're going to the masses and plenty of ads what we've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate and unfortunately it doesn't work so well anymore either but there's good news around the corner really good news I call it the idea of tribes what tribes are is a very simple concept that goes back 50,000 years it's it's about leading and connecting people and ideas and it's something that people have wanted forever lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe or a church tribe having a work tribe having a community tribe but now thanks to the Internet thanks to the explosion of mass media thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world tribes are everywhere the internet was supposed to homogenize Everyone by connecting us all instead what it's allowed is silos of Interest so you got the Red Hat Ladies over here you got the red hat triathletes over there you got the organized armies over here you got the disorganized rebels over here you got people in white hats making food and people in white hats sailing boats the point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them because you want to be connected that people on the fringes can find each other connect and go somewhere every town that has a volunteer fire department understand understands this way of thinking now it turns out this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo people I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon and that what firemen do to Train sometimes is they take a house that's going to be torn down and they burn it down instead and practice putting it out but they always stop and take a picture so you know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one they got their own flag they got the eye patches you can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe and it turns out that it's tribes not money not factories that can change our world that can change politics that can align large numbers of people not CU you forc them to do something against their will but because they wanted to connect that what we do for a living now all of us I think is find something worth changing and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea and it becomes something far bigger than ourselves it becomes a movement so when Al Gore set out to change the world again he didn't do it by himself and he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads he did it by creating a movement thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night you don't need everyone what Kevin Kelly has taught us is you just need I don't know a thousand true fans a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round that means that the idea you create the product you create the movement you create isn't for everyone it's not a mass thing that's not what this is about what it's about instead is finding the True Believers it's easy to look at what I've said so far and say wait a minute I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader so here are two leaders they don't have a lot in common they're about the same age but that's about it what they did though is each in their own way created a different way of navigating your way through technology so some people would go out and get people to be on one team and some people will get people to be on the other team it also informs the decisions you make when you make products or Serv Services you know this is one of my favorite devices but what a shame that it's not organized to help authors create movements what would happen if when you're using your Kindle you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment or from your book group or from your friends or from the circle you want what would happen if authors or people with ideas could use version two which comes out on Monday and use it to organize people who want to talk talk about something now there's a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here but let me just try a couple The Beatles did not invent teenagers they merely decided to lead them that most movements most leadership they were doing is about finding a group that's disconnected but already has a yearning not persuading people to want something they don't have yet when Diane hats worked on the metrix her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan she didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue but she helped organize people and helped turn it into a movement Ugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of Venezuela he merely LED them Bob Marley did not invent rosarians he just stepped up and said follow me Derek cers invented CD Baby which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man to have a place to take the mission they already wanted to go to and connect with each other what all these people have in common is that they are Heretics that Heretics look at the status quo and say this will not stand I can't abide this status quo I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward I see what the status quo is I don't like it that instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them that instead of of being what I call a sheep Walker somebody who's half asleep following instructions keeping their head down fitting in every once in a while someone stands up and says not me someone stands up and says this one's important we need to organize around it and not everyone will but you don't need everyone you just need a few people who will look at the rules realize they make no sense and realize how much they want to be connected so Tony Shay does not run a shoe store zapo isn't a shoe store zapo is the one the only the best there ever was place for people who are into shoes to find each other to talk about their passion to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow it can be something as prosaic as shoes and something as complicated as overthrowing a government it's exactly the same behavior though what it requires as Geraldine Carter has discovered is to be able to say I can't do this by myself but if I can get other people to join my climate ride then together we can get something that we all want we just waiting for someone to lead us Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture she doesn't do it by quiet L building one house at a time she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it by connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other by Leading a movement and making change and around and around and around it goes so three questions I'd offer you the first one is who exactly are you upsetting cuz if you're not upsetting anyone you're not changing the Status Quo the second question is who are you connecting because for a lot of people that's what they're in it for the connections that are being made one to the other and the third one is who are you leading because focusing on that part of it not the mechanics of what you're building but The Who and the leading part is where change comes so you know Blake at Tom shoes had a very simple idea what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes I gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn't even own a pair of shoes this is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus it's a story of a product that tells a story and as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says what are those you get to tell the story on Blake's behalf on behalf of the people who got the shoes and suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 Pair of Shoes it's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes my friend red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes not fighting the organization that's fighting it fighting with them leading them connecting them challenging the status quo because it's important to him and the people he surrounds himself with need the connection they need the leadership it makes a difference you don't need permission from people to lead them but in case you do here it is they're waiting we're waiting for you to show us where to go next so here's what leaders have in common the first thing is they challenge the status quo they challenge what's currently there the second thing is they build a culture a secret language a seven-second handshake a way of knowing that you're in or out they have curiosity curiosity about the people in the tribe curiosity about Outsiders they're asking questions they connect people to one another do you know what people want more than anything they want to be missed they want to be missed the day they don't show up they want to be missed when they're gone and tribe leaders can do that and it's fascinating because all tribe leaders have Charisma but you don't need Charisma to become a leader being a leader gives you Charisma and if you look and study the leaders who have succeeded that's where Charisma comes from from the leading and finally they commit they commit to the cause they commit to the tribe they commit to the people who are there so I'd like you to do something for me and I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out of hand what I want you to do it only takes 24 hours is create a movement something that matters start do it we need it thank you very much I appreciate [Music] it

could share with you about the mechanics here but let me just try a couple The Beatles did not invent teenagers they merely decided to lead them that most movements most leadership they were doing is about finding a group that's disconnected but already has a yearning not persuading people to want something they don't have yet when Diane hats worked on the metrix her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan she didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue but she helped organize people and helped turn it into a movement Ugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of Venezuela he merely LED them Bob Marley did not invent rosarians he just stepped up and said follow me Derek cers invented CD Baby which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man to have a place to take the mission they already wanted to go to and connect with each other what all these people have in common is that they are Heretics that Heretics look at the status quo and say this will not stand I can't abide this status quo I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward I see what the status quo is I don't like it that instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them that instead of of being what I call a sheep Walker somebody who's half asleep following instructions keeping their head down fitting in every once in a while someone stands up and says not me someone stands up and says this one's important we need to organize around it and not everyone will but you don't need everyone you just need a few people who will look at the rules realize they make no sense and realize how much they want to be connected so Tony Shay does not run a shoe store zapo isn't a shoe store zapo is the one the only the best there ever was place for people who are into shoes to find each other to talk about their passion to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow it can be something as prosaic as shoes and something as complicated as overthrowing a government it's exactly the same behavior though what it requires as Geraldine Carter has discovered is to be able to say I can't do this by myself but if I can get other people to join my climate ride then together we can get something that we all want we just waiting for someone to lead us Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture she doesn't do it by quiet L building one house at a time she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it by connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other by Leading a movement and making change and around and around and around it goes so three questions I'd offer you the first one is who exactly are you upsetting cuz if you're not upsetting anyone you're not changing the Status Quo the second question is who are you connecting because for a lot of people that's what they're in it for the connections that are being made one to the other and the third one is who are you leading because focusing on that part of it not the mechanics of what you're building but The Who and the leading part is where change comes so you know Blake at Tom shoes had a very simple idea what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes I gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn't even own a pair of shoes this is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus it's a story of a product that tells a story and as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says what are those you get to tell the story on Blake's behalf on behalf of the people who got the shoes and suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 Pair of Shoes it's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes my friend red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes not fighting the organization that's fighting it fighting with them leading them connecting them challenging the status quo because it's important to him and the people he surrounds himself with need the connection they need the leadership it makes a difference you don't need permission from people to lead them but in case you do here it is they're waiting we're waiting for you to show us where to go next so here's what leaders have in common the first thing is they challenge the status quo they challenge what's currently there the second thing is they build a culture a secret language a seven-second handshake a way of knowing that you're in or out they have curiosity curiosity about the people in the tribe curiosity about Outsiders they're asking questions they connect people to one another do you know what people want more than anything they want to be missed they want to be missed the day they don't show up they want to be missed when they're gone and tribe leaders can do that and it's fascinating because all tribe leaders have Charisma but you don't need Charisma to become a leader being a leader gives you Charisma and if you look and study the leaders who have succeeded that's where Charisma comes from from the leading and finally they commit they commit to the cause they commit to the tribe they commit to the people who are there so I'd like you to do something for me and I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out of hand what I want you to do it only takes 24 hours is create a movement something that matters start do it we need it thank you very much I appreciate [Music] it

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so sometimes I get invited to give weird talks uh I got invited to speak to the people who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes to perform at sporting events unfortunately I I couldn't go but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys at least most of them know what it is that they do for a living what they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events shortly after that I got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals and again I couldn't go but it's a fascinating group they make balloon animals there's a big Schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals but they do a lot of really cool stuff with sometimes they get in trouble but not often and the other thing about these guys is they also know what they do for a living they make balloon animals but what do we do for a living what exactly do the people watching this do every day and I want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything that we try to find a piece of the status quo something that bothers us something that needs to be improved something that's itching to be changed and we change it and we try to make big permanent important change but we don't think about it that way and we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like and I've been studying it for a couple years and I want to share a couple stories with you today first about a guy named Nathan winegrad Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA and what you may not know about the history of the sbca is it was founded to kill dogs and cats cities gave them a charter to get rid of the Stray animals on the street and Destroy them and in a typical year 4 million dogs and cats were killed most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off the street Nathan and his boss saw this and they could not tolerate it so they set out to make San Francisco a no kill City create an entire city where every dog and cat unless it was Ill or dangerous would be adopted did not killed and everyone said it was impossible Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance and people from s SPCA and Humane shelters from around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane they persisted and Nathan went directly to the community he connected with people who cared about this nonprofessionals people with passion and within just a couple years San Francisco became the first no kill City running no deficit completely supported by the community Nathan left and went to Tomkins County New York a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States and he did it again he went from being a glorified dog catcher to completely transforming the community and then he went to North Carolina and did it again and he went to Reno and he did it again and when I think about what Nathan did and when I think about people here do I think about ideas and I think about the idea that creating an idea spreading an idea has a lot behind it and I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding but what they do is they take a light bulb and um They smash it now there's a bunch of reasons for that and stories about it but one reason is because it indicates a change from before to after it's a moment in time and I want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented we started with the factory idea that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient Factory that could turn out change we then went to the TV idea that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece if you could get on TV enough times if you could buy enough ads you could win and now we're in this new model of leadership where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system but by Leading so let me talk about the three Cycles the first one is the factory cycle Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea it enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay him $5 a day because he's got an efficient enough Factory well with that sort of Advantage you can churn out a lot of cars you can make a lot of change you can get roads built you can change the fabric of an entire country that the essence of what you're doing is you need ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines and the problem we've run into is we're running out of both ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines so we shift gears for a minute and say I know television avertising push push take a good idea and push it on the world I have a better mouse trap and if I can just get enough money to tell enough people I'll sell enough and you can build an entire industry on that if necessary you can put babies in your ads if necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff and if babies don't work you can use doctors but be careful because you don't want to get an unfortunate Dr to position when you're talking about one thing instead of the other this model requires you to act like the the king like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back that you are in charge and you're going to tell people what to do next that you know the quick little diagram of it is you're up here and you are pushing it out to the world this Method mass marketing requires average ideas because you're going to the masses and plenty of ads what we've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate and unfortunately it doesn't work so well anymore either but there's good news around the corner really good news I call it the idea of tribes what tribes are is a very simple concept that goes back 50,000 years it's it's about leading and connecting people and ideas and it's something that people have wanted forever lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe or a church tribe having a work tribe having a community tribe but now thanks to the Internet thanks to the explosion of mass media thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world tribes are everywhere the internet was supposed to homogenize Everyone by connecting us all instead what it's allowed is silos of Interest so you got the Red Hat Ladies over here you got the red hat triathletes over there you got the organized armies over here you got the disorganized rebels over here you got people in white hats making food and people in white hats sailing boats the point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them because you want to be connected that people on the fringes can find each other connect and go somewhere every town that has a volunteer fire department understand understands this way of thinking now it turns out this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo people I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon and that what firemen do to Train sometimes is they take a house that's going to be torn down and they burn it down instead and practice putting it out but they always stop and take a picture so you know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one they got their own flag they got the eye patches you can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe and it turns out that it's tribes not money not factories that can change our world that can change politics that can align large numbers of people not CU you forc them to do something against their will but because they wanted to connect that what we do for a living now all of us I think is find something worth changing and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea and it becomes something far bigger than ourselves it becomes a movement so when Al Gore set out to change the world again he didn't do it by himself and he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads he did it by creating a movement thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night you don't need everyone what Kevin Kelly has taught us is you just need I don't know a thousand true fans a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round that means that the idea you create the product you create the movement you create isn't for everyone it's not a mass thing that's not what this is about what it's about instead is finding the True Believers it's easy to look at what I've said so far and say wait a minute I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader so here are two leaders they don't have a lot in common they're about the same age but that's about it what they did though is each in their own way created a different way of navigating your way through technology so some people would go out and get people to be on one team and some people will get people to be on the other team it also informs the decisions you make when you make products or Serv Services you know this is one of my favorite devices but what a shame that it's not organized to help authors create movements what would happen if when you're using your Kindle you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment or from your book group or from your friends or from the circle you want what would happen if authors or people with ideas could use version two which comes out on Monday and use it to organize people who want to talk talk about something now there's a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here but let me just try a couple The Beatles did not invent teenagers they merely decided to lead them that most movements most leadership they were doing is

worth changing and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea and it becomes something far bigger than ourselves it becomes a movement so when Al Gore set out to change the world again he didn't do it by himself and he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads he did it by creating a movement thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night you don't need everyone what Kevin Kelly has taught us is you just need I don't know a thousand true fans a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round that means that the idea you create the product you create the movement you create isn't for everyone it's not a mass thing that's not what this is about what it's about instead is finding the True Believers it's easy to look at what I've said so far and say wait a minute I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader so here are two leaders they don't have a lot in common they're about the same age but that's about it what they did though is each in their own way created a different way of navigating your way through technology so some people would go out and get people to be on one team and some people will get people to be on the other team it also informs the decisions you make when you make products or Serv Services you know this is one of my favorite devices but what a shame that it's not organized to help authors create movements what would happen if when you're using your Kindle you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment or from your book group or from your friends or from the circle you want what would happen if authors or people with ideas could use version two which comes out on Monday and use it to organize people who want to talk talk about something now there's a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here but let me just try a couple The Beatles did not invent teenagers they merely decided to lead them that most movements most leadership they were doing is about finding a group that's disconnected but already has a yearning not persuading people to want something they don't have yet when Diane hats worked on the metrix her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan she didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue but she helped organize people and helped turn it into a movement Ugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of Venezuela he merely LED them Bob Marley did not invent rosarians he just stepped up and said follow me Derek cers invented CD Baby which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man to have a place to take the mission they already wanted to go to and connect with each other what all these people have in common is that they are Heretics that Heretics look at the status quo and say this will not stand I can't abide this status quo I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward I see what the status quo is I don't like it that instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them that instead of of being what I call a sheep Walker somebody who's half asleep following instructions keeping their head down fitting in every once in a while someone stands up and says not me someone stands up and says this one's important we need to organize around it and not everyone will but you don't need everyone you just need a few people who will look at the rules realize they make no sense and realize how much they want to be connected so Tony Shay does not run a shoe store zapo isn't a shoe store zapo is the one the only the best there ever was place for people who are into shoes to find each other to talk about their passion to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow it can be something as prosaic as shoes and something as complicated as overthrowing a government it's exactly the same behavior though what it requires as Geraldine Carter has discovered is to be able to say I can't do this by myself but if I can get other people to join my climate ride then together we can get something that we all want we just waiting for someone to lead us Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture she doesn't do it by quiet L building one house at a time she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it by connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other by Leading a movement and making change and around and around and around it goes so three questions I'd offer you the first one is who exactly are you upsetting cuz if you're not upsetting anyone you're not changing the Status Quo the second question is who are you connecting because for a lot of people that's what they're in it for the connections that are being made one to the other and the third one is who are you leading because focusing on that part of it not the mechanics of what you're building but The Who and the leading part is where change comes so you know Blake at Tom shoes had a very simple idea what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes I gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn't even own a pair of shoes this is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus it's a story of a product that tells a story and as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says what are those you get to tell the story on Blake's behalf on behalf of the people who got the shoes and suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 Pair of Shoes it's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes my friend red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes not fighting the organization that's fighting it fighting with them leading them connecting them challenging the status quo because it's important to him and the people he surrounds himself with need the connection they need the leadership it makes a difference you don't need permission from people to lead them but in case you do here it is they're waiting we're waiting for you to show us where to go next so here's what leaders have in common the first thing is they challenge the status quo they challenge what's currently there the second thing is they build a culture a secret language a seven-second handshake a way of knowing that you're in or out they have curiosity curiosity about the people in the tribe curiosity about Outsiders they're asking questions they connect people to one another do you know what people want more than anything they want to be missed they want to be missed the day they don't show up they want to be missed when they're gone and tribe leaders can do that and it's fascinating because all tribe leaders have Charisma but you don't need Charisma to become a leader being a leader gives you Charisma and if you look and study the leaders who have succeeded that's where Charisma comes from from the leading and finally they commit they commit to the cause they commit to the tribe they commit to the people who are there so I'd like you to do something for me and I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out of hand what I want you to do it only takes 24 hours is create a movement something that matters start do it we need it thank you very much I appreciate [Music] it

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so sometimes I get invited to give weird talks uh I got invited to speak to the people who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes to perform at sporting events unfortunately I I couldn't go but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys at least most of them know what it is that they do for a living what they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events shortly after that I got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals and again I couldn't go but it's a fascinating group they make balloon animals there's a big Schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals but they do a lot of really cool stuff with sometimes they get in trouble but not often and the other thing about these guys is they also know what they do for a living they make balloon animals but what do we do for a living what exactly do the people watching this do every day and I want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything that we try to find a piece of the status quo something that bothers us something that needs to be improved something that's itching to be changed and we change it and we try to make big permanent important change but we don't think about it that way and we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like and I've been studying it for a couple years and I want to share a couple stories with you today first about a guy named Nathan winegrad Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA and what you may not know about the history of the sbca is it was founded to kill dogs and cats cities gave them a charter to get rid of the Stray animals on the street and Destroy them and in a typical year 4 million dogs and cats were killed most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off the street Nathan and his boss saw this and they could not tolerate it so they set out to make San Francisco a no kill City create an entire city where every dog and cat unless it was Ill or dangerous would be adopted did not killed and everyone said it was impossible Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance and people from s SPCA and Humane shelters from around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane they persisted and Nathan went directly to the community he connected with people who cared about this nonprofessionals people with passion and within just a couple years San Francisco became the first no kill City running no deficit completely supported by the community Nathan left and went to Tomkins County New York a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States and he did it again he went from being a glorified dog catcher to completely transforming the community and then he went to North Carolina and did it again and he went to Reno and he did it again and when I think about what Nathan did and when I think about people here do I think about ideas and I think about the idea that creating an idea spreading an idea has a lot behind it and I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding but what they do is they take a light bulb and um They smash it now there's a bunch of reasons for that and stories about it but one reason is because it indicates a change from before to after it's a moment in time and I want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented we started with the factory idea that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient Factory that could turn out change we then went to the TV idea that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece if you could get on TV enough times if you could buy enough ads you could win and now we're in this new model of leadership where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system but by Leading so let me talk about the three Cycles the first one is the factory cycle Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea it enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay him $5 a day because he's got an efficient enough Factory well with that sort of Advantage you can churn out a lot of cars you can make a lot of change you can get roads built you can change the fabric of an entire country that the essence of what you're doing is you need ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines and the problem we've run into is we're running out of both ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines so we shift gears for a minute and say I know television avertising push push take a good idea and push it on the world I have a better mouse trap and if I can just get enough money to tell enough people I'll sell enough and you can build an entire industry on that if necessary you can put babies in your ads if necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff and if babies don't work you can use doctors but be careful because you don't want to get an unfortunate Dr to position when you're talking about one thing instead of the other this model requires you to act like the the king like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back that you are in charge and you're going to tell people what to do next that you know the quick little diagram of it is you're up here and you are pushing it out to the world this Method mass marketing requires average ideas because you're going to the masses and plenty of ads what we've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate and unfortunately it doesn't work so well anymore either but there's good news around the corner really good news I call it the idea of tribes what tribes are is a very simple concept that goes back 50,000 years it's it's about leading and connecting people and ideas and it's something that people have wanted forever lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe or a church tribe having a work tribe having a community tribe but now thanks to the Internet thanks to the explosion of mass media thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world tribes are everywhere the internet was supposed to homogenize Everyone by connecting us all instead what it's allowed is silos of Interest so you got the Red Hat Ladies over here you got the red hat triathletes over there you got the organized armies over here you got the disorganized rebels over here you got people in white hats making food and people in white hats sailing boats the point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them because you want to be connected that people on the fringes can find each other connect and go somewhere every town that has a volunteer fire department understand understands this way of thinking now it turns out this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo people I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon and that what firemen do to Train sometimes is they take a house that's going to be torn down and they burn it down instead and practice putting it out but they always stop and take a picture so you know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one they got their own flag they got the eye patches you can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe and it turns out that it's tribes not money not factories that can change our world that can change politics that can align large numbers of people not CU you forc them to do something against their will but because they wanted to connect that what we do for a living now all of us I think is find something worth changing and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea and it becomes something far bigger than ourselves it becomes a movement so when Al Gore set out to change the world again he didn't do it by himself and he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads he did it by creating a movement thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I want to talk about the election for the first time in the United States a predominantly white group of Voters voted for an African-American candidate for president and in fact Barack Obama did quite well he won 375 electoral votes and he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate of any race of any party in history if you compare how Obama did against how John krey had done four years earlier Democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes Bluer becomes more democratic even States Obama lost like out west those States became more blue in the south in the Northeast almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there um one exception is in Massachusetts that was John K 's home state no big surprise Obama couldn't do better than Carrie there or in Arizona which is John McCain's home Obama didn't have much improvement but there's also this part of the country kind of in the middle region here this kind of Arkansas Tennessee Oklahoma West Virginia region now if you look at 96 Bill Clinton the last Democrat to actually win how he did in 96 you see real big differences in this part of the country right here the kind of Appalachians Ozarks Highlands region as I call it 20 or 30 point swings from how Bill Clinton did in 96 to how Obama did in 2008 Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas these are very very profound differences so when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas you know and there's a book written called what's the matter with Kansas but really the question here Obama did relatively well in Kansas he lost badly but every Democrat does he lost no worse than most people do but yeah what's the matter with Arkansas and when we think of Arkansa we tend to have pretty negative connotations we think of a bunch of rednecks quote unquote with guns and we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama we think it's a matter of race and is this Fair are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas and this part of the country and the answer is it is at least partially fair and we know that race was a factor and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people I'm actually we didn't ask them but when they conducted exit polls in every state in 37 States out of the 50 they asked a question that was pretty direct about race they asked this question in deciding your vote for president today was the race of the candidate a factor we're looking for people that said yes race was a factor moreover it was an important factor in my decision and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor maybe in combination with other factors maybe alone and we're looking for this Behavior among white voters or really uh non-black voters so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question in Louisiana about one in five white voters said yes one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African-American if those people had voted for Obama even half of them Obama would have won Louisiana safely same is true with I think all of these states you see on the top of the list meanwhile California New York we can say oh we're enlightened but you know certainly much lower incidents of this admitted I suppose manifestation of racially based voting here's the same data on a map and you kind of see the relationship between the redder states are where more people responded and said yes Barack Obama race was a problem for me and you see comparing the map to 96 you see an overlap here this really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country so we have to ask why is racism predictable in some way is there something driving this is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand in Kentucky or are there more systematic factors that work and so we can look at a bunch of different variables these are the things that economists and political scientists look at all the time things like income and religion education which of these seem to drive um this manifestation of racism in this big natural experiment we had on November 4th and there are a couple of these that that have strong predictive relationships one of which is education where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red and you see this part of the country the kind of Appalachians region is less educated it's just a fact and you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns the other variable that's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in uh states that are more rural even to some extent States like New Hampshire and Maine they exhibited a little bit of this kind of racially based voting against Barack Obama so it's the combination of these two things it's education and the type of neighbors that you have which we'll talk about more in a moment and the thing about States like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they're both very rural and they're educationally impoverished so yes racism is predictable these things among maybe other variables but these things seem to predict it we're going to like drill down a little bit more now into something called The General Social Survey this is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year and they asked a series of really interesting questions in 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes and one simple question they ask is does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood and we can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different in cities about 80% of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race but in rural communities only about 30% probably because if you live on a farm you might not have a lot of neighbors period but nevertheless you're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you so what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors or really some neighbor of another race and people who have only white neighbors and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes not a lot of difference This was um 8 years ago were more Republican back then but you see Democrats verus Republican not a big difference based on who your neighbors are and even some questions about race for example affirmative action which is kind of a political question a policy question about race if you will not much difference here affirmative action is not very popular frankly with white voters period but people with black neighbors and people in monoracial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really but if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more kind of personal if you will do you favor a law Banning interracial marriage there's a difference people who don't have neighbors of A different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you and likewise they asked not in 2000 but in the same survey 1996 would you not vote for a qualified black president and you see people without neighbors who are African-American were much more likely to say that would give me a problem so it's really not even about Urban versus rural it's about kind of who you live with and racism is predictable it's

racial group and I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do kind of get a mix of people that you might not

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I want to talk about the election for the first time in the United States a predominantly white group of Voters voted for an African-American candidate for president and in fact Barack Obama did quite well he won 375 electoral votes and he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate of any race of any party in history if you compare how Obama did against how John krey had done four years earlier Democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes Bluer becomes more democratic even States Obama lost like out west those States became more blue in the south in the Northeast almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there um one exception is in Massachusetts that was John K 's home state no big surprise Obama couldn't do better than Carrie there or in Arizona which is John McCain's home Obama didn't have much improvement but there's also this part of the country kind of in the middle region here this kind of Arkansas Tennessee Oklahoma West Virginia region now if you look at 96 Bill Clinton the last Democrat to actually win how he did in 96 you see real big differences in this part of the country right here the kind of Appalachians Ozarks Highlands region as I call it 20 or 30 point swings from how Bill Clinton did in 96 to how Obama did in 2008 Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas these are very very profound differences so when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas you know and there's a book written called what's the matter with Kansas but really the question here Obama did relatively well in Kansas he lost badly but every Democrat does he lost no worse than most people do but yeah what's the matter with Arkansas and when we think of Arkansa we tend to have pretty negative connotations we think of a bunch of rednecks quote unquote with guns and we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama we think it's a matter of race and is this Fair are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas and this part of the country and the answer is it is at least partially fair and we know that race was a factor and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people I'm actually we didn't ask them but when they conducted exit polls in every state in 37 States out of the 50 they asked a question that was pretty direct about race they asked this question in deciding your vote for president today was the race of the candidate a factor we're looking for people that said yes race was a factor moreover it was an important factor in my decision and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor maybe in combination with other factors maybe alone and we're looking for this Behavior among white voters or really uh non-black voters so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question in Louisiana about one in five white voters said yes one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African-American if those people had voted for Obama even half of them Obama would have won Louisiana safely same is true with I think all of these states you see on the top of the list meanwhile California New York we can say oh we're enlightened but you know certainly much lower incidents of this admitted I suppose manifestation of racially based voting here's the same data on a map and you kind of see the relationship between the redder states are where more people responded and said yes Barack Obama race was a problem for me and you see comparing the map to 96 you see an overlap here this really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country so we have to ask why is racism predictable in some way is there something driving this is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand in Kentucky or are there more systematic factors that work and so we can look at a bunch of different variables these are the things that economists and political scientists look at all the time things like income and religion education which of these seem to drive um this manifestation of racism in this big natural experiment we had on November 4th and there are a couple of these that that have strong predictive relationships one of which is education where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red and you see this part of the country the kind of Appalachians region is less educated it's just a fact and you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns the other variable that's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in uh states that are more rural even to some extent States like New Hampshire and Maine they exhibited a little bit of this kind of racially based voting against Barack Obama so it's the combination of these two things it's education and the type of neighbors that you have which we'll talk about more in a moment and the thing about States like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they're both very rural and they're educationally impoverished so yes racism is predictable these things among maybe other variables but these things seem to predict it we're going to like drill down a little bit more now into something called The General Social Survey this is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year and they asked a series of really interesting questions in 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes and one simple question they ask is does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood and we can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different in cities about 80% of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race but in rural communities only about 30% probably because if you live on a farm you might not have a lot of neighbors period but nevertheless you're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you so what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors or really some neighbor of another race and people who have only white neighbors and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes not a lot of difference This was um 8 years ago were more Republican back then but you see Democrats verus Republican not a big difference based on who your neighbors are and even some questions about race for example affirmative action which is kind of a political question a policy question about race if you will not much difference here affirmative action is not very popular frankly with white voters period but people with black neighbors and people in monoracial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really but if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more kind of personal if you will do you favor a law Banning interracial marriage there's a difference people who don't have neighbors of A different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you and likewise they asked not in 2000 but in the same survey 1996 would you not vote for a qualified black president and you see people without neighbors who are African-American were much more likely to say that would give me a problem so it's really not even about Urban versus rural it's about kind of who you live with and racism is predictable it's predicted by an interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you people of other races so if we want to address it the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races and I have a couple of very obvious I suppose ideas for maybe how to do that I'm a big fan of cities especially if we have cities that are diverse and sustainable and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups I think cities facilitate more the kind of networking and kind of casual interaction that you might have on a daily basis but also not everyone wants to live in a City certainly not a city like New York so we can think more about things like Street grids this is the neighborhood where I grew up in East laning Michigan it's a traditional Midwestern Community which means you have a real grid you have real neighborhoods and real trees and real streets you can walk on and you interact a lot with your neighbors people you like people you might not know um and as a result a very tolerant Community which is different I think than something like this which is in shamberg Illinois where kind of every little set of houses has their own cool toac and kind of drive through Starbucks and stuff like that I think that actually this type of Urban Design which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s I think there's a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan um but also here's another idea we have is an interc Colgate Exchange program where you have students going from New York abroad but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from myu have them go study for semester at the University of Arkansas and vice versa are do it at the high school level literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from um another part of the country or of another racial group and I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do kind of get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise but the point is this is all good news because when something is uh predictable it's what I call designable we can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem even a problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism if we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't we can start to design solutions to it so that's all I have to say thank you very [Applause] much

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I want to talk about the election for the first time in the United States a predominantly white group of Voters voted for an African-American candidate for president and in fact Barack Obama did quite well he won 375 electoral votes and he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate of any race of any party in history if you compare how Obama did against how John krey had done four years earlier Democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes Bluer becomes more democratic even States Obama lost like out west those States became more blue in the south in the Northeast almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there um one exception is in Massachusetts that was John K 's home state no big surprise Obama couldn't do better than Carrie there or in Arizona which is John McCain's home Obama didn't have much improvement but there's also this part of the country kind of in the middle region here this kind of Arkansas Tennessee Oklahoma West Virginia region now if you look at 96 Bill Clinton the last Democrat to actually win how he did in 96 you see real big differences in this part of the country right here the kind of Appalachians Ozarks Highlands region as I call it 20 or 30 point swings from how Bill Clinton did in 96 to how Obama did in 2008 Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas these are very very profound differences so when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas you know and there's a book written called what's the matter with Kansas but really the question here Obama did relatively well in Kansas he lost badly but every Democrat does he lost no worse than most people do but yeah what's the matter with Arkansas and when we think of Arkansa we tend to have pretty negative connotations we think of a bunch of rednecks quote unquote with guns and we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama we think it's a matter of race and is this Fair are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas and this part of the country and the answer is it is at least partially fair and we know that race was a factor and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people I'm actually we didn't ask them but when they conducted exit polls in every state in 37 States out of the 50 they asked a question that was pretty direct about race they asked this question in deciding your vote for president today was the race of the candidate a factor we're looking for people that said yes race was a factor moreover it was an important factor in my decision and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor maybe in combination with other factors maybe alone and we're looking for this Behavior among white voters or really uh non-black voters so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question in Louisiana about one in five white voters said yes one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African-American if those people had voted for Obama even half of them Obama would have won Louisiana safely same is true with I think all of these states you see on the top of the list meanwhile California New York we can say oh we're enlightened but you know certainly much lower incidents of this admitted I suppose manifestation of racially based voting here's the same data on a map and you kind of see the relationship between the redder states are where more people responded and said yes Barack Obama race was a problem for me and you see comparing the map to 96 you see an overlap here this really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country so we have to ask why is racism predictable in some way is there something driving this is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand in Kentucky or are there more systematic factors that work and so we can look at a bunch of different variables these are the things that economists and political scientists look at all the time things like income and religion education which of these seem to drive um this manifestation of racism in this big natural experiment we had on November 4th and there are a couple of these that that have strong predictive relationships one of which is education where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red and you see this part of the country the kind of Appalachians region is less educated it's just a fact and you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns the other variable that's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in uh states that are more rural even to some extent States like New Hampshire and Maine they exhibited a little bit of this kind of racially based voting against Barack Obama so it's the combination of these two things it's education and the type of neighbors that you have which we'll talk about more in a moment and the thing about States like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they're both very rural and they're educationally impoverished so yes racism is predictable these things among maybe other variables but these things seem to predict it we're going to like drill down a little bit more now into something called The General Social Survey this is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year and they asked a series of really interesting questions in 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes and one simple question they ask is does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood and we can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different in cities about 80% of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race but in rural communities only about 30% probably because if you live on a farm you might not have a lot of neighbors period but nevertheless you're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you so what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors or really some neighbor of another race and people who have only white neighbors and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes not a lot of difference This was um 8 years ago were more Republican back then but you see Democrats verus Republican not a big difference based on who your neighbors are and even some questions about race for example affirmative action which is kind of a political question a policy question about race if you will not much difference here affirmative action is not very popular frankly with white voters period but people with black neighbors and people in monoracial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really but if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more kind of personal if you will do you favor a law Banning interracial marriage there's a difference people who don't have neighbors of A different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you and likewise they asked not in 2000 but in the same survey 1996 would you not vote for a qualified black president and you see people without neighbors who are African-American were much more likely to say that would give me a problem so it's really not even about Urban versus rural it's about kind of who you live with and racism is predictable it's predicted by an interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you people of other races so if we want to address it the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races and I have a couple of very obvious I suppose ideas for maybe how to do that I'm a big fan of cities especially if we have cities that are diverse and sustainable and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups I think cities facilitate more the kind of networking and kind of casual interaction that you might have on a daily basis but also not everyone wants to live in a City certainly not a city like New York so we can think more about things like Street grids this is the neighborhood where I grew up in East laning Michigan it's a traditional Midwestern Community which means you have a real grid you have real neighborhoods and real trees and real streets you can walk on and you interact a lot with your neighbors people you like people you might not know um and as a result a very tolerant Community which is different I think than something like this which is in shamberg Illinois where kind of every little set of houses has their own cool toac and kind of drive through Starbucks and stuff like that I think that actually this type of Urban Design which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s I think there's a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan um but also here's another idea we have is an interc Colgate Exchange program where you have students going from New York abroad but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from myu have them go study for semester at the University of Arkansas and vice versa are do it at the high school level literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from um another part of the country or of another racial group and I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do kind of get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise but the point is this is all good news because when something is uh predictable it's what I call designable we can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem even a problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism if we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't we can start to design solutions to it so that's all I have to say thank you very [Applause] much

**Transcript**:
so how would you run a whole country without oil that's the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago and it never left my brain and I started playing with it more like puzzle the original thought I had this must be ethanol so I went out and researched ethanol and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country about six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen until some scientists told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car if you use hydrogen so that's not going to be the path to go and then sort of through a process of wandering around I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars in a way that is convenient and affordable you could get to a solution now I started this from a point of view that it's it has to be something that scales a mass not how do you build one car but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99% of the population the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today so one it has to be more convenient than a car and two has to be more affordable than today's cars and affordable is not a $40,000 sedan right that's not something we can finance or buy today inconvenient is not something you drive for an hour and charge Freight so we're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics and so the thought that that I started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up how do you do it within economics that we have today how do you do it from the power of the consumer up and not from the power of an edict down in on a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic batteries not included now if you separate between the two you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network by creating a network before the cars show up and the network has two components in them first component is you charge the car whenever you stop ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours in park for about 22 hours and if you drive a car in the morning you drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute and so the first thought that came to mind is everywhere we park we have electric power now it sounds crazy but in some places around the world like Scandinavia you already have that if you park your car and didn't plug in the heater when you come back you don't have a car it just doesn't work now that last mile last foot in a sense is the first step of the infrastructure the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension see we're bound by today's technology on batteries which is about a hundred and twenty miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and and wait limitations in a 120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people but you never want to get stuck and so what we added as a second element to our network which is a battery swap system you drive you take your depleted battery out a full battery comes on and you drive on and you don't do it as a human being you do it as a machine it looks like a car wash you come into your car wash and the plate comes up hold your battery takes it out and puts them back in and within two minutes you're back on the road and you can go again if you had charged spots everywhere and you had battery swap stations everywhere how often would you do it it ends up that you do swapping less times and you stop at a gas station as a matter of fact we add it to the contract we said that if you stopped to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience then we looked at the question of the affordability and we looked at the question what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car what is the cost of that battery everybody tells us batteries are so expensive and what we found out that when you move from molecules to electrons something interesting happens we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again the battery is not the gas stank in a sense remember in your car you have a gas tank you have the crude oil and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil is what we call petrol or gasoline the battery in this sense is the crude oil we have a battery bay it costs the same hundred dollar as the gas tank but the crude oil is replaced with a battery just it doesn't burn it consumes itself step after step it has 2000 life cycles these days and so it's sort of a mini well we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well for the life of the car nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car in a sense what we've done is we created a new consumable you today buy gasoline miles and we created electric miles and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number today 2010 in volume when we come to market it is eight cents a mile those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means in the average consumer environment we're in in the u.s. 20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50 a buck 60 a gallon that's cheaper than today's gasoline even in the u.s. in Europe where taxes are in place that's the equivalent to ace my nough $60 barrel but e miles follow Moore's law they go from 8 cents a mile in 2010 to 4 cents a mile in 2015 to 2 cents a mile by 2020 why because battery's life cycle improve a bit of improvement on energy density which reduces the price and these prices are actually with clean electron we do not use any electron that come from coal so in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 which is our desire imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road that is an 80 cent gallon 80 cent gala means if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil and we'll let any oil company bring it out and refine it they still can't compete with 2 cents a mile that's a new economic factor which is fascinating to most people now this would have been a wonderful paper so that's how I solved it in my head it was a white paper I handed out to governments and some governments told me that it's fascinating that the young generation actually thinks about these things until we got to the true young global leader Shimon Peres president of Israel and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me first he let me go to the prime minister of the country who told me if you can find the money you need for this network two hundred million dollars and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume in two million cars that's what we needed in Israel I'll give you a country to invest the 200 million into Paris thought that was a great idea so we went out and we we looked at all the car companies we send letters to all the car companies three of them never showed up one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they will give us a discount but one of them Carlos go and see over an O and Nissan when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating said hybrids are like mermaids when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish and gone came up and said I have the car mr. Paris I will build you the cars and he actually true to form Renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume mass volume being the first year a hundred thousand cars it's the first mass volume electric car zero emission electric car in the market I was running as Chris said to be the CEO of a large software company at called s AP and then Paris said well once you run this project and I said well I'm ready for CEO and he said no no no no no you got to explain to me what is more important than saving your country and saving the world that you would go and do and I had to quit and come do this thing called better place now we then decided to scale it up we went to other countries as I said we went to Denmark and Denmark said this beautiful policy it's called the IQ test it's inversely proportional to taxes they put a hundred and eighty percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero emission cars so if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark it cost you about sixty thousand euros if you buy our car it's about twenty thousand euro if you failed the IQ test they ask you to leave we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small island I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island but Israel is an island it's Transportation Island if your cars driving outside Israel it's been stolen and so if if you're thinking about it in terms of islands we decided to go to the biggest island we could find and that was Australia the third country we announced was Australia it's got three centres in Brisbane and Melbourne and Sydney and one freeway when electric free where they connect them the next Island was not too hard to find and that was Hawaii we decided to come into the US and pick the two best places the one where you didn't need any arranged extension Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery and if you really have a long day you can switch and keep on driving around the island and the second one was the San Francisco Bay Area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors he decided that he's going to take over the state unofficially and then officially and then created this beautiful region one policy and in San Francisco Bay and not only do you have the highest concentration of Priuses but you also have the perfect range extender it's called the other car now as we started scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the US why why is this a big issue and the most fascinating thing we've learned is that when you have small problems an individual level like the price of gasoline to drive every morning you don't notice it but when the aggregate comes up you're dead all right so the price of oil much like lots of other curves that we've seen goes along a depletion curve the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground and we'll keep getting wells that are further away from the ground he becomes more and more and more expensive to dig him out now you think well you know it's been up it's been down it's been up its gonna keep on going up and down here's the problem at 147 dollars a barrel which we were in six months ago the u.s. spent a ton of money to get oil then we lost our economy we went back down to 47 sometimes at 40 sometimes it's 50 now we're running a stimulus package it's called a trillion-dollar stimulus package we're gonna revive the economy hopefully it happens between now and 2015 somewhere in that space what happens when the economy recovers by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace were going at right now that's another 30 percent demand on oil that is another 25 million barrels a day that's all the u.s. usage today in other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak and then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as $200 a barrel we take our money and we give it away you know what happens at that point we go back down it's going to go up and down and the downs are gonna be much longer than the ups are gonna be much shorter and that's the difference between problems that are additive like co2 which we go slowly up and then we tip and problems that are depletive in which we lose what we have which oscillate in the oscillate until we lose everything we got now we actually looked at what the answer would be right remember in the campaign 1 million hybrid cars by 2015 that is 0.5% of the US oil consumption that is 0.0 well percent of the rest of the world that won't do much difference we looked at an MIT study 10 million electric cars on the global roads 10 million out of 500 million we will add between now and then that is the most pessimistic number you can have it's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from a hundred thousand cars in 2011 to 10 million cars by 2016 a hundred X growth in less than five years you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars we have 10 million cars by region that's an enormous amount of cars China is adding those cars India Russia Brazil we have all these region Europe has solved it they just put tax on gasoline they'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high China solves it by an edict at some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city and that will be it the Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on Range not a reduction in range we're the only ones who don't have the price set right don't have the industry set right don't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u.s. now whereas the car industry on that very interesting the car industry has been focused just on themselves they basically looked at it and said Carwin Auto will solve everything within the car itself no infrastructure no problem we forgot about the entire chain around us all this stuff that happens around we are looking at an emergence of a car to zero a whole new market a whole new business model a business model in which the money that is actually coming in to drive the car the minutes the miles if you want that you are all familiar with subsidized the price of the car just like cell phone you'll pay for the miles and some of it will go back to the car maker some of it will go back to your own pocket but our cars are actually gonna be cheaper than gasoline cars you're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills in Denmark we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills not from oil in Israel we've asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel and people said oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for we said what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years and I said what we tried there isn't any we said no no but what if we prove it and they say well you can dig and we decided to dig up instead of digging down these are perfect matches to one another now all you need is about 10% of the electricity generated think of it as a project that spans over about ten years that's 1% a year now when we're looking at solving big problems we need to start thinking in two numbers and those are not 20% by 2020 the two numbers are zero as in zero footprint or zero oil and scale at infinity and when we go to cop 15 at the end of this year we can't stop thinking at patting co2 we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale one car emits four tonnes and actually 700 and change million cars today I'm a at 2.8 billion tons of co2 that's in the additive about 25% of our problem cars and trucks add up to about 25% of the world's co2 emissions we have to come and attack this problem with a focus with an effort that actually says we're gonna go to zero before the world ends I actually share that with some legislators here in the US I shared it with with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr who's one of my idols and I told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remember it is because he said we're gonna send a man to the moon and we'll do it by the end of the decade we didn't say we're gonna send a man 20% to the moon and they'll be about 20% chance we'll recover him he actually shared with me another story which is from about 200 years ago 200 years ago in Parliament in Great Britain there was a long argument over economy versus morality 25 percent just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars 25 percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in in the UK came from a source of energy that was immoral human slaves and there was an argument should we stop using slaves and what would it do to our economy and people say what we need to take time to do it let's not do it immediately maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves and after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery and the Industrial Revolution started within less than one year in the UK had a hundred years of economic growth we have to make the right moral decision we have to make it immediately we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in Israel that said we were Ndoye 'el and we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years but within this presidential term because if we don't we will lose our economy right after we lost our morality thank you all very much you

**Transcript**:
so how would you run a whole country without oil that's the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago and it never left my brain and I started playing with it more like puzzle the original thought I had this must be ethanol so I went out and researched ethanol and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country about six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen until some scientists told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car if you use hydrogen so that's not going to be the path to go and then sort of through a process of wandering around I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars in a way that is convenient and affordable you could get to a solution now I started this from a point of view that it's it has to be something that scales a mass not how do you build one car but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99% of the population the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today so one it has to be more convenient than a car and two has to be more affordable than today's cars and affordable is not a $40,000 sedan right that's not something we can finance or buy today inconvenient is not something you drive for an hour and charge Freight so we're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics and so the thought that that I started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up how do you do it within economics that we have today how do you do it from the power of the consumer up and not from the power of an edict down in on a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic batteries not included now if you separate between the two you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network by creating a network before the cars show up and the network has two components in them first component is you charge the car whenever you stop ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours in park for about 22 hours and if you drive a car in the morning you drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute and so the first thought that came to mind is everywhere we park we have electric power now it sounds crazy but in some places around the world like Scandinavia you already have that if you park your car and didn't plug in the heater when you come back you don't have a car it just doesn't work now that last mile last foot in a sense is the first step of the infrastructure the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension see we're bound by today's technology on batteries which is about a hundred and twenty miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and and wait limitations in a 120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people but you never want to get stuck and so what we added as a second element to our network which is a battery swap system you drive you take your depleted battery out a full battery comes on and you drive on and you don't do it as a human being you do it as a machine it looks like a car wash you come into your car wash and the plate comes up hold your battery takes it out and puts them back in and within two minutes you're back on the road and you can go again if you had charged spots everywhere and you had battery swap stations everywhere how often would you do it it ends up that you do swapping less times and you stop at a gas station as a matter of fact we add it to the contract we said that if you stopped to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience then we looked at the question of the affordability and we looked at the question what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car what is the cost of that battery everybody tells us batteries are so expensive and what we found out that when you move from molecules to electrons something interesting happens we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again the battery is not the gas stank in a sense remember in your car you have a gas tank you have the crude oil and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil is what we call petrol or gasoline the battery in this sense is the crude oil we have a battery bay it costs the same hundred dollar as the gas tank but the crude oil is replaced with a battery just it doesn't burn it consumes itself step after step it has 2000 life cycles these days and so it's sort of a mini well we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well for the life of the car nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car in a sense what we've done is we created a new consumable you today buy gasoline miles and we created electric miles and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number today 2010 in volume when we come to market it is eight cents a mile those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means in the average consumer environment we're in in the u.s. 20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50 a buck 60 a gallon that's cheaper than today's gasoline even in the u.s. in Europe where taxes are in place that's the equivalent to ace my nough $60 barrel but e miles follow Moore's law they go from 8 cents a mile in 2010 to 4 cents a mile in 2015 to 2 cents a mile by 2020 why because battery's life cycle improve a bit of improvement on energy density which reduces the price and these prices are actually with clean electron we do not use any electron that come from coal so in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 which is our desire imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road that is an 80 cent gallon 80 cent gala means if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil and we'll let any oil company bring it out and refine it they still can't compete with 2 cents a mile that's a new economic factor which is fascinating to most people now this would have been a wonderful paper so that's how I solved it in my head it was a white paper I handed out to governments and some governments told me that it's fascinating that the young generation actually thinks about these things until we got to the true young global leader Shimon Peres president of Israel and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me first he let me go to the prime minister of the country who told me if you can find the money you need for this network two hundred million dollars and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume in two million cars that's what we needed in Israel I'll give you a country to invest the 200 million into Paris thought that was a great idea so we went out and we we looked at all the car companies we send letters to all the car companies three of them never showed

**Transcript**:
so how would you run a whole country without oil that's the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago and it never left my brain and I started playing with it more like puzzle the original thought I had this must be ethanol so I went out and researched ethanol and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country about six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen until some scientists told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car if you use hydrogen so that's not going to be the path to go and then sort of through a process of wandering around I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars in a way that is convenient and affordable you could get to a solution now I started this from a point of view that it's it has to be something that scales a mass not how do you build one car but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99% of the population the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today so one it has to be more convenient than a car and two has to be more affordable than today's cars and affordable is not a $40,000 sedan right that's not something we can finance or buy today inconvenient is not something you drive for an hour and charge Freight so we're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics and so the thought that that I started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up how do you do it within economics that we have today how do you do it from the power of the consumer up and not from the power of an edict down in on a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic batteries not included now if you separate between the two you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network by creating a network before the cars show up and the network has two components in them first component is you charge the car whenever you stop ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours in park for about 22 hours and if you drive a car in the morning you drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute and so the first thought that came to mind is everywhere we park we have electric power now it sounds crazy but in some places around the world like Scandinavia you already have that if you park your car and didn't plug in the heater when you come back you don't have a car it just doesn't work now that last mile last foot in a sense is the first step of the infrastructure the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension see we're bound by today's technology on batteries which is about a hundred and twenty miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and and wait limitations in a 120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people but you never want to get stuck and so what we added as a second element to our network which is a battery swap system you drive you take your depleted battery out a full battery comes on and you drive on and you don't do it as a human being you do it as a machine it looks like a car wash you come into your car wash and the plate comes up hold your battery takes it out and puts them back in and within two minutes you're back on the road and you can go again if you had charged spots everywhere and you had battery swap stations everywhere how often would you do it it ends up that you do swapping less times and you stop at a gas station as a matter of fact we add it to the contract we said that if you stopped to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience then we looked at the question of the affordability and we looked at the question what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car what is the cost of that battery everybody tells us batteries are so expensive and what we found out that when you move from molecules to electrons something interesting happens we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again the battery is not the gas stank in a sense remember in your car you have a gas tank you have the crude oil and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil is what we call petrol or gasoline the battery in this sense is the crude oil we have a battery bay it costs the same hundred dollar as the gas tank but the crude oil is replaced with a battery just it doesn't burn it consumes itself step after step it has 2000 life cycles these days and so it's sort of a mini well we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well for the life of the car nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car in a sense what we've done is we created a new consumable you today buy gasoline miles and we created electric miles and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number today 2010 in volume when we come to market it is eight cents a mile those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means in the average consumer environment we're in in the u.s. 20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50 a buck 60 a gallon that's cheaper than today's gasoline even in the u.s. in Europe where taxes are in place that's the equivalent to ace my nough $60 barrel but e miles follow Moore's law they go from 8 cents a mile in 2010 to 4 cents a mile in 2015 to 2 cents a mile by 2020 why because battery's life cycle improve a bit of improvement on energy density which reduces the price and these prices are actually with clean electron we do not use any electron that come from coal so in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 which is our desire imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road that is an 80 cent gallon 80 cent gala means if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil and we'll let any oil company bring it out and refine it they still can't compete with 2 cents a mile that's a new economic factor which is fascinating to most people now this would have been a wonderful paper so that's how I solved it in my head it was a white paper I handed out to governments and some governments told me that it's fascinating that the young generation actually thinks about these things until we got to the true young global leader Shimon Peres president of Israel and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me first he let me go to the prime minister of the country who told me if you can find the money you need for this network two hundred million dollars and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume in two million cars that's what we needed in Israel I'll give you a country to invest the 200 million into Paris thought that was a great idea so we went out and we we looked at all the car companies we send letters to all the car companies three of them never showed up one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they will give us a discount but one of them Carlos go and see over an O and Nissan when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating said hybrids are like mermaids when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish and gone came up and said I have the car mr. Paris I will build you the cars and he actually true to form Renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume mass volume being the first year a hundred thousand cars it's the first mass volume electric car zero emission electric car in the market I was running as Chris said to be the CEO of a large software company at called s AP and then Paris said well once you run this project and I said well I'm ready for CEO and he said no no no no no you got to explain to me what is more important than saving your country and saving the world that you would go and do and I had to quit and come do this thing called better place now we then decided to scale it up we went to other countries as I said we went to Denmark and Denmark said this beautiful policy it's called the IQ test it's inversely proportional to taxes they put a hundred and eighty percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero emission cars so if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark it cost you about sixty thousand euros if you buy our car it's about twenty thousand euro if you failed the IQ test they ask you to leave we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small island I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island but Israel is an island it's Transportation Island if your cars driving outside Israel it's been stolen and so if if you're thinking about it in terms of islands we decided to go to the biggest island we could find and that was Australia the third country we announced was Australia it's got three centres in Brisbane and Melbourne and Sydney and one freeway when electric free where they connect them the next Island was not too hard to find and that was Hawaii we decided to come into the US and pick the two best places the one where you didn't need any arranged extension Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery and if you really have a long day you can switch and keep on driving around the island and the second one was the San Francisco Bay Area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors he decided that he's going to take over the state unofficially and then officially and then created this beautiful region one policy and in San Francisco Bay and not only do you have the highest concentration of Priuses but you also have the perfect range extender it's called the other car now as we started scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the US why why is this a big issue and the most fascinating thing we've learned is that when you have small problems an individual level like the price of gasoline to drive every morning you don't notice it but when the aggregate comes up you're dead all right so the price of oil much like lots of other curves that we've seen goes along a depletion curve the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground and we'll keep getting wells that are further away from the ground he becomes more and more and more expensive to dig him out now you think well you know it's been up it's been down it's been up its gonna keep on going up and down here's the problem at 147 dollars a barrel which we were in six months ago the u.s. spent a ton of money to get oil then we lost our economy we went back down to 47 sometimes at 40 sometimes it's 50 now we're running a stimulus package it's called a trillion-dollar stimulus package we're gonna revive the economy hopefully it happens between now and 2015 somewhere in that space what happens when the economy recovers by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace were going at right now that's another 30 percent demand on oil that is another 25 million barrels a day that's all the u.s. usage today in other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak and then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as $200 a barrel we take our money and we give it away you know what happens at that point we go back down it's going to go up and down and the downs are gonna be much longer than the ups are gonna be much shorter and that's the difference between problems that are additive like co2 which we go slowly up and then we tip and problems that are depletive in which we lose what we have which oscillate in the oscillate until we lose everything we got now we actually looked at what the answer would be right remember in the campaign 1 million hybrid cars by 2015 that is 0.5% of the US oil consumption that is 0.0 well percent of the rest of the world that won't do much difference we looked at an MIT study 10 million electric cars on the global roads 10 million out of 500 million we will add between now and then that is the most pessimistic number you can have it's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from a hundred thousand cars in 2011 to 10 million cars by 2016 a hundred X growth in less than five years you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars we have 10 million cars by region that's an enormous amount of cars China is adding those cars India Russia Brazil we have all these region Europe has solved it they just put tax on gasoline they'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high China solves it by an edict at some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city and that will be it the Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on Range not a reduction in range we're the only ones who don't have the price set right don't have the industry set right don't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u.s. now whereas the car industry on that very interesting the car industry has been focused just on themselves they basically looked at it and said Carwin Auto will solve everything within the car itself no infrastructure no problem we forgot about the entire chain around us all this stuff that happens around we are looking at an emergence of a car to zero a whole new market a whole new business model a business model in which the money that is actually coming in to drive the car the minutes the miles if you want that you are all familiar with subsidized the price of the car just like cell phone you'll pay for the miles and some of it will go back to the car maker some of it will go back to your own pocket but our cars are actually gonna be cheaper than gasoline cars you're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills in Denmark we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills not from oil in Israel we've asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel and people said oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for we said what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years and I said what we tried there isn't any we said no no but what if we prove it and they say well you can dig and we decided to dig up instead of digging down these are perfect matches to one another now all you need is about 10% of the electricity generated think of it as a project that spans over about ten years that's 1% a year now when we're looking at solving big problems we need to start thinking in two numbers and those are not 20% by 2020 the two numbers are zero as in zero footprint or zero oil and scale at infinity and when we go to cop 15 at the end of this year we can't stop thinking at patting co2 we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale one car emits four tonnes and actually 700 and change million cars today I'm a at 2.8 billion tons of co2 that's in the additive about 25% of our problem cars and trucks add up to about 25% of the world's co2 emissions we have to come and attack this problem with a focus with an effort that actually says we're gonna go to zero before the world ends I actually share that with some legislators here in the US I shared it with with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr who's one of my idols and I told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remember it is because he said we're gonna send a man to the moon and we'll do it by the end of the decade we didn't say we're gonna send a man 20% to the moon and they'll be about 20% chance we'll recover him he actually shared with me another story which is from about 200 years ago 200 years ago in Parliament in Great Britain there was a long argument over economy versus morality 25 percent just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars 25 percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in in the UK came from a source of energy that was immoral human slaves and there was an argument should we stop using slaves and what would it do to our economy and people say what we need to take time to do it let's not do it immediately maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves and after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery and the Industrial Revolution started within less than one year in the UK had a hundred years of economic growth we have to make the right moral decision we have to make it immediately we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in Israel that said we were Ndoye 'el and we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years but within this presidential term because if we don't we will lose our economy right after we lost our morality thank you all very much you

in the oscillate until we lose everything we got now we actually looked at what the answer would be right remember in the campaign 1 million hybrid cars by 2015 that is 0.5% of the US oil consumption that is 0.0 well percent of the rest of the world that won't do much difference we looked at an MIT study 10 million electric cars on the global roads 10 million out of 500 million we will add between now and then that is the most pessimistic number you can have it's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from a hundred thousand cars in 2011 to 10 million cars by 2016 a hundred X growth in less than five years you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars we have 10 million cars by region that's an enormous amount of cars China is adding those cars India Russia Brazil we have all these region Europe has solved it they just put tax on gasoline they'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high China solves it by an edict at some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city and that will be it the Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on Range not a reduction in range we're the only ones who don't have the price set right don't have the industry set right don't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u.s. now whereas the car industry on that very interesting the car industry has been focused just on themselves they basically looked at it and said Carwin Auto will solve everything within the car itself no infrastructure no problem we forgot about the entire chain around us all this stuff that happens around we are looking at an emergence of a car to zero a whole new market a whole new business model a business model in which the money that is actually coming in to drive the car the minutes the miles if you want that you are all familiar with subsidized the price of the car just like cell phone you'll pay for the miles and some of it will go back to the car maker some of it will go back to your own pocket but our cars are actually gonna be cheaper than gasoline cars you're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills in Denmark we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills not from oil in Israel we've asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel and people said oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for we said what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years and I said what we tried there isn't any we said no no but what if we prove it and they say well you can dig and we decided to dig up instead of digging down these are perfect matches to one another now all you need is about 10% of the electricity generated think of it as a project that spans over about ten years that's 1% a year now when we're looking at solving big problems we need to start thinking in two numbers and those are not 20% by 2020 the two numbers are zero as in zero footprint or zero oil and scale at infinity and when we go to cop 15 at the end of this year we can't stop thinking at patting co2 we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale one car emits four tonnes and actually 700 and change million cars today I'm a at 2.8 billion tons of co2 that's in the additive about 25% of our problem cars and trucks add up to about 25% of the world's co2 emissions we have to come and attack this problem with a focus with an effort that actually says we're gonna go to zero before the world ends I actually share that with some legislators here in the US I shared it with with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr who's one of my idols and I told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remember it is because he said we're gonna send a man to the moon and we'll do it by the end of the decade we didn't say we're gonna send a man 20% to the moon and they'll be about 20% chance we'll recover him he actually shared with me another story which is from about 200 years ago 200 years ago in Parliament in Great Britain there was a long argument over economy versus morality 25 percent just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars 25 percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in in the UK came from a source of energy that was immoral human slaves and there was an argument should we stop using slaves and what would it do to our economy and people say what we need to take time to do it let's not do it immediately maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves and after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery and the Industrial Revolution started within less than one year in the UK had a hundred years of economic growth we have to make the right moral decision we have to make it immediately we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in Israel that said we were Ndoye 'el and we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years but within this presidential term because if we don't we will lose our economy right after we lost our morality thank you all very much you

**Transcript**:
so how would you run a whole country without oil that's the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago and it never left my brain and I started playing with it more like puzzle the original thought I had this must be ethanol so I went out and researched ethanol and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country about six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen until some scientists told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car if you use hydrogen so that's not going to be the path to go and then sort of through a process of wandering around I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars in a way that is convenient and affordable you could get to a solution now I started this from a point of view that it's it has to be something that scales a mass not how do you build one car but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99% of the population the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today so one it has to be more convenient than a car and two has to be more affordable than today's cars and affordable is not a $40,000 sedan right that's not something we can finance or buy today inconvenient is not something you drive for an hour and charge Freight so we're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics and so the thought that that I started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up how do you do it within economics that we have today how do you do it from the power of the consumer up and not from the power of an edict down in on a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic batteries not included now if you separate between the two you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network by creating a network before the cars show up and the network has two components in them first component is you charge the car whenever you stop ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours in park for about 22 hours and if you drive a car in the morning you drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute and so the first thought that came to mind is everywhere we park we have electric power now it sounds crazy but in some places around the world like Scandinavia you already have that if you park your car and didn't plug in the heater when you come back you don't have a car it just doesn't work now that last mile last foot in a sense is the first step of the infrastructure the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension see we're bound by today's technology on batteries which is about a hundred and twenty miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and and wait limitations in a 120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people but you never want to get stuck and so what we added as a second element to our network which is a battery swap system you drive you take your depleted battery out a full battery comes on and you drive on and you don't do it as a human being you do it as a machine it looks like a car wash you come into your car wash and the plate comes up hold your battery takes it out and puts them back in and within two minutes you're back on the road and you can go again if you had charged spots everywhere and you had battery swap stations everywhere how often would you do it it ends up that you do swapping less times and you stop at a gas station as a matter of fact we add it to the contract we said that if you stopped to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience then we looked at the question of the affordability and we looked at the question what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car what is the cost of that battery everybody tells us batteries are so expensive and what we found out that when you move from molecules to electrons something interesting happens we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again the battery is not the gas stank in a sense remember in your car you have a gas tank you have the crude oil and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil is what we call petrol or gasoline the battery in this sense is the crude oil we have a battery bay it costs the same hundred dollar as the gas tank but the crude oil is replaced with a battery just it doesn't burn it consumes itself step after step it has 2000 life cycles these days and so it's sort of a mini well we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well for the life of the car nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car in a sense what we've done is we created a new consumable you today buy gasoline miles and we created electric miles and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number today 2010 in volume when we come to market it is eight cents a mile those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means in the average consumer environment we're in in the u.s. 20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50 a buck 60 a gallon that's cheaper than today's gasoline even in the u.s. in Europe where taxes are in place that's the equivalent to ace my nough $60 barrel but e miles follow Moore's law they go from 8 cents a mile in 2010 to 4 cents a mile in 2015 to 2 cents a mile by 2020 why because battery's life cycle improve a bit of improvement on energy density which reduces the price and these prices are actually with clean electron we do not use any electron that come from coal so in a sense this is an absolute zero carbon zero fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 which is our desire imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road that is an 80 cent gallon 80 cent gala means if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil and we'll let any oil company bring it out and refine it they still can't compete with 2 cents a mile that's a new economic factor which is fascinating to most people now this would have been a wonderful paper so that's how I solved it in my head it was a white paper I handed out to governments and some governments told me that it's fascinating that the young generation actually thinks about these things until we got to the true young global leader Shimon Peres president of Israel and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me first he let me go to the prime minister of the country who told me if you can find the money you need for this network two hundred million dollars and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume in two million cars that's what we needed in Israel I'll give you a country to invest the 200 million into Paris thought that was a great idea so we went out and we we looked at all the car companies we send letters to all the car companies three of them never showed up one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they will give us a discount but one of them Carlos go and see over an O and Nissan when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating said hybrids are like mermaids when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish and gone came up and said I have the car mr. Paris I will build you the cars and he actually true to form Renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume mass volume being the first year a hundred thousand cars it's the first mass volume electric car zero emission electric car in the market I was running as Chris said to be the CEO of a large software company at called s AP and then Paris said well once you run this project and I said well I'm ready for CEO and he said no no no no no you got to explain to me what is more important than saving your country and saving the world that you would go and do and I had to quit and come do this thing called better place now we then decided to scale it up we went to other countries as I said we went to Denmark and Denmark said this beautiful policy it's called the IQ test it's inversely proportional to taxes they put a hundred and eighty percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero emission cars so if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark it cost you about sixty thousand euros if you buy our car it's about twenty thousand euro if you failed the IQ test they ask you to leave we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small island I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island but Israel is an island it's Transportation Island if your cars driving outside Israel it's been stolen and so if if you're thinking about it in terms of islands we decided to go to the biggest island we could find and that was Australia the third country we announced was Australia it's got three centres in Brisbane and Melbourne and Sydney and one freeway when electric free where they connect them the next Island was not too hard to find and that was Hawaii we decided to come into the US and pick the two best places the one where you didn't need any arranged extension Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery and if you really have a long day you can switch and keep on driving around the island and the second one was the San Francisco Bay Area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors he decided that he's going to take over the state unofficially and then officially and then created this beautiful region one policy and in San Francisco Bay and not only do you have the highest concentration of Priuses but you also have the perfect range extender it's called the other car now as we started scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the US why why is this a big issue and the most fascinating thing we've learned is that when you have small problems an individual level like the price of gasoline to drive every morning you don't notice it but when the aggregate comes up you're dead all right so the price of oil much like lots of other curves that we've seen goes along a depletion curve the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground and we'll keep getting wells that are further away from the ground he becomes more and more and more expensive to dig him out now you think well you know it's been up it's been down it's been up its gonna keep on going up and down here's the problem at 147 dollars a barrel which we were in six months ago the u.s. spent a ton of money to get oil then we lost our economy we went back down to 47 sometimes at 40 sometimes it's 50 now we're running a stimulus package it's called a trillion-dollar stimulus package we're gonna revive the economy hopefully it happens between now and 2015 somewhere in that space what happens when the economy recovers by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace were going at right now that's another 30 percent demand on oil that is another 25 million barrels a day that's all the u.s. usage today in other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak and then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as $200 a barrel we take our money and we give it away you know what happens at that point we go back down it's going to go up and down and the downs are gonna be much longer than the ups are gonna be much shorter and that's the difference between problems that are additive like co2 which we go slowly up and then we tip and problems that are depletive in which we lose what we have which oscillate in the oscillate until we lose everything we got now we actually looked at what the answer would be right remember in the campaign 1 million hybrid cars by 2015 that is 0.5% of the US oil consumption that is 0.0 well percent of the rest of the world that won't do much difference we looked at an MIT study 10 million electric cars on the global roads 10 million out of 500 million we will add between now and then that is the most pessimistic number you can have it's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from a hundred thousand cars in 2011 to 10 million cars by 2016 a hundred X growth in less than five years you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars we have 10 million cars by region that's an enormous amount of cars China is adding those cars India Russia Brazil we have all these region Europe has solved it they just put tax on gasoline they'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high China solves it by an edict at some point they'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city and that will be it the Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on Range not a reduction in range we're the only ones who don't have the price set right don't have the industry set right don't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u.s. now whereas the car industry on that very interesting the car industry has been focused just on themselves they basically looked at it and said Carwin Auto will solve everything within the car itself no infrastructure no problem we forgot about the entire chain around us all this stuff that happens around we are looking at an emergence of a car to zero a whole new market a whole new business model a business model in which the money that is actually coming in to drive the car the minutes the miles if you want that you are all familiar with subsidized the price of the car just like cell phone you'll pay for the miles and some of it will go back to the car maker some of it will go back to your own pocket but our cars are actually gonna be cheaper than gasoline cars you're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills in Denmark we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills not from oil in Israel we've asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel and people said oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for we said what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years and I said what we tried there isn't any we said no no but what if we prove it and they say well you can dig and we decided to dig up instead of digging down these are perfect matches to one another now all you need is about 10% of the electricity generated think of it as a project that spans over about ten years that's 1% a year now when we're looking at solving big problems we need to start thinking in two numbers and those are not 20% by 2020 the two numbers are zero as in zero footprint or zero oil and scale at infinity and when we

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Let me guess, you've got Facebook albums full of photos. You have photos on your computer desktop, on your mobile phone, on your bedroom wall. You see photos in magazines and newspapers, on the side of buses, and of course, in your family albums. We take photos for granted in a major way. But, creating a picture that looked exactly like the person or thing that you were photographing wasn't always obvious. In fact, in the past, it was a big mystery. How could you, in essence, take your reflection in the mirror and freeze it in there? In the 9th century, the Arab scientist Alhazen had come up with the idea of using the camera obscura, which was literally a dark room, or box, with a single, small hole in one side that let light through. This would project the image outside into the wall inside. During the Renaissance, artists like Leonardo DaVinci used this method to introduce 3-D scenes onto a flat plane so that they could copy things, like perspective, more easily. In 1724, Johann Heinrich Schultz discovered that exposing certain silver compounds to light altered their appearance and left marks wherever the light touched. Essentially, Schultz found a way to record the images that Alhazen was able to project, but only for a little while. Schultz's images disappeared soon after he had made them. It wasn't until 1839 that people figured out how to project images onto light-sensitive surfaces that would retain the image after exposure, and thus, photography was born. At that point, it was mostly two inventors who fought for the best way to make photos. One was British scientist Henry Fox Talbot, whose calotype process used paper and allowed many copies to be made from a single negative. The other inventor, Louis Daguerre, was an artist and chemist in France. He developed something called a daguerreotype, which used a silvered plate and which produced a sharper image. But the daguerreotype could only make positive images so copies had to be made by taking another photo. In the end, the daguerreotype won out as the first commercially successful photographic process mostly because the government made it freely available to the public. So now that photography was available, getting a picture of yourself would be a snap, right? Well, not exactly! This process still required a whole dark room at the location of the photograph, which was a big hassle. Picture the early photographers lugging enormous trailers with all their equipment wherever they wanted to take a picture. Not only that, but the early processes had extremely long exposure times. To get a good photo, you would have to stand perfectly still for up to two minutes! This led to development of inventions like the head holder, a wire frame that would hide behind you while supporting your head. It's also why you don't see people smiling in early photographs. It's not that life was that bad, it was just hard to keep a steady grin for more than a few seconds, so people opted for a straight-faced look. And then George Eastman came along. Eastman believed that everyone should have access to photography, and he spent many late nights mixing chemicals in his mother's kitchen to try to achieve a dry plate photographic process. This would allow exposed negatives to be stored and developed later at a more convenient place instead of carting those dark rooms, necessary for wet plates, around. After starting a business, which initially made dry plates, Eastman eventually discovered plastic roll film that would fit in hand-held, inexpensive cameras. These cameras sold by the millions under the tag line, "You push the button, we do the rest." While Eastman was largely responsible for making photography a universal pastime, even he could not have dreamed of the ways photography had since shaped the world. It's now estimated that over 380 billion photographs are taken each year. That's more photographs each day than were taken in the first hundred years after photography was invented. Say cheese!

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Which Arab scientist is credited with the idea of using the camera obscura to project images?
Options: A. Alhazen, B. Leonardo DaVinci, C. Johann Heinrich Schultz, D. George Eastman

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.9000 (The generated question is very relevant to the ground truth question, as it asks about the same concept of the camera obscura. However, it adds a slight twist by specifying the scientist's ethnicity, which is not present in the ground truth question.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 1.0000 (The correct answer option in the generated question matches the ground truth answer, which is Alhazen.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.8000 (The distractors in the generated question are plausible, but one of them, Leonardo DaVinci, is mentioned in the transcript as an artist who used the camera obscura, which might make it a less effective distractor. The other two distractors, Johann Heinrich Schultz and George Eastman, are not directly related to the camera obscura, making them more effective.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 0.9000 (The generated question and options are clear and easy to understand, but the added phrase "to project images" might make the question slightly more complex than the ground truth question.)
- Total Score: 0.8500

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Let me guess, you've got Facebook albums full of photos. You have photos on your computer desktop, on your mobile phone, on your bedroom wall. You see photos in magazines and newspapers, on the side of buses, and of course, in your family albums. We take photos for granted in a major way. But, creating a picture that looked exactly like the person or thing that you were photographing wasn't always obvious. In fact, in the past, it was a big mystery. How could you, in essence, take your reflection in the mirror and freeze it in there? In the 9th century, the Arab scientist Alhazen had come up with the idea of using the camera obscura, which was literally a dark room, or box, with a single, small hole in one side that let light through. This would project the image outside into the wall inside. During the Renaissance, artists like Leonardo DaVinci used this method to introduce 3-D scenes onto a flat plane so that they could copy things, like perspective, more easily. In 1724, Johann Heinrich Schultz discovered that exposing certain silver compounds to light altered their appearance and left marks wherever the light touched. Essentially, Schultz found a way to record the images that Alhazen was able to project, but only for a little while. Schultz's images disappeared soon after he had made them. It wasn't until 1839 that people figured out how to project images onto light-sensitive surfaces that would retain the image after exposure, and thus, photography was born. At that point, it was mostly two inventors who fought for the best way to make photos. One was British scientist Henry Fox Talbot, whose calotype process used paper and allowed many copies to be made from a single negative. The other inventor, Louis Daguerre, was an artist and chemist in France. He developed something called a daguerreotype, which used a silvered plate and which produced a sharper image. But the daguerreotype could only make positive images so copies had to be made by taking another photo. In the end, the daguerreotype won out as the first commercially successful photographic process mostly because the government made it freely available to the public. So now that photography was available, getting a picture of yourself would be a snap, right? Well, not exactly! This process still required a whole dark room at the location of the photograph, which was a big hassle. Picture the early photographers lugging enormous trailers with all their equipment wherever they wanted to take a picture. Not only that, but the early processes had extremely long exposure times. To get a good photo, you would have to stand perfectly still for up to two minutes! This led to development of inventions like the head holder, a wire frame that would hide behind you while supporting your head. It's also why you don't see people smiling in early photographs. It's not that life was that bad, it was just hard to keep a steady grin for more than a few seconds, so people opted for a straight-faced look. And then George Eastman came along. Eastman believed that everyone should have access to photography, and he spent many late nights mixing chemicals in his mother's kitchen to try to achieve a dry plate photographic process. This would allow exposed negatives to be stored and developed later at a more convenient place instead of carting those dark rooms, necessary for wet plates, around. After starting a business, which initially made dry plates, Eastman eventually discovered plastic roll film that would fit in hand-held, inexpensive cameras. These cameras sold by the millions under the tag line, "You push the button, we do the rest." While Eastman was largely responsible for making photography a universal pastime, even he could not have dreamed of the ways photography had since shaped the world. It's now estimated that over 380 billion photographs are taken each year. That's more photographs each day than were taken in the first hundred years after photography was invented. Say cheese!

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Every cell in your body is separated from those around it by its outermost layer, its membrane. A cell membrane must be both sturdy and flexible. Imagine a membrane made of metal - great at keeping the cell's guts inside, but horrible at letting materials flow in and out. But a membrane made of fishnet stocking would go too far in the opposite direction - leaky, but easily torn. So, the ideal membrane falls somewhere in the middle. Over the past few centuries, we've learned a lot about the way membranes work. The tale starts in the late 1800's when, according to legend, a German woman named Agnes Pockels was doing dishes. Her observation, that not all detergents dissolve grease in the same way, piqued her curiosity, so she made careful measurements of the size of soapy films that formed on the surface of a metal tray filled with water. Later, in the 1920's, GE scientists Irving Langmuir and Katharine Blodgett reexamined the problem with a more elaborate contraption and found that those tiny slicks were in fact a single layer of oil molecules. Each oil molecule has one side that loves water and floats on the surface, and one side that loathes water and protrudes into the air. So what does it have to do with cell membranes? Well, at the turn of the 20th century, chemists Charles Overton and Hans Meyer demonstrated that the cell membrane is composed of substances that, like oil, have a water-loving part and a water-loathing part. We now call these substances lipids. In 1925, two scientists, Evert Gorter and Francois Grendel, pushed our understanding further. They designed an experiment meant to test whether cell membranes are made of only one layer of lipids, a monolayer, or two layers stacked on top of one another, called a bilayer. Gorter and Grendel drew blood from a dog, a sheep, a rabbit, a goat, a guinea pig, and human volunteers. From each of these samples, they extracted all the lipids from all the red blood cells and placed a few drops of this extract on a tray of water. True to form, the lipids, like oil, spread out into a monolayer, whose size Gorter and Grendel could measure. If they compared the surface area of that monolayer to the surface area to the intact red blood cells, they'd be able to tell whether the red blood cell membrane is one or two layers thick. To understand the design of their experiment, imagine looking down at a sandwich. If you measure the surface area of what you see, you'll get the dimensions of a single slice of bread even though there are two slices, one stacked perfectly atop the other. But, if you open the sandwich and place the two slices side by side, you get twice the surface area. The Gorter and Grendel experiment is basically the same idea. The open sandwich is the monolayer formed by extracted cellular lipids spreading out into a sheet. The closed sandwich is the intact red blood cell membrane. Low and behold, they observed a two-to-one ratio, proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that a cell membrane is a bilayer, which when unstacked, yields a monolayer twice its size. So almost 30 years before the double-helix structure of DNA was elucidated, a single experiment involving fancy versions of household materials enabled deep insight into the basic architecture of the cell.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Every cell in your body is separated from those around it by its outermost layer, its membrane. A cell membrane must be both sturdy and flexible. Imagine a membrane made of metal - great at keeping the cell's guts inside, but horrible at letting materials flow in and out. But a membrane made of fishnet stocking would go too far in the opposite direction - leaky, but easily torn. So, the ideal membrane falls somewhere in the middle. Over the past few centuries, we've learned a lot about the way membranes work. The tale starts in the late 1800's when, according to legend, a German woman named Agnes Pockels was doing dishes. Her observation, that not all detergents dissolve grease in the same way, piqued her curiosity, so she made careful measurements of the size of soapy films that formed on the surface of a metal tray filled with water. Later, in the 1920's, GE scientists Irving Langmuir and Katharine Blodgett reexamined the problem with a more elaborate contraption and found that those tiny slicks were in fact a single layer of oil molecules. Each oil molecule has one side that loves water and floats on the surface, and one side that loathes water and protrudes into the air. So what does it have to do with cell membranes? Well, at the turn of the 20th century, chemists Charles Overton and Hans Meyer demonstrated that the cell membrane is composed of substances that, like oil, have a water-loving part and a water-loathing part. We now call these substances lipids. In 1925, two scientists, Evert Gorter and Francois Grendel, pushed our understanding further. They designed an experiment meant to test whether cell membranes are made of only one layer of lipids, a monolayer, or two layers stacked on top of one another, called a bilayer. Gorter and Grendel drew blood from a dog, a sheep, a rabbit, a goat, a guinea pig, and human volunteers. From each of these samples, they extracted all the lipids from all the red blood cells and placed a few drops of this extract on a tray of water. True to form, the lipids, like oil, spread out into a monolayer, whose size Gorter and Grendel could measure. If they compared the surface area of that monolayer to the surface area to the intact red blood cells, they'd be able to tell whether the red blood cell membrane is one or two layers thick. To understand the design of their experiment, imagine looking down at a sandwich. If you measure the surface area of what you see, you'll get the dimensions of a single slice of bread even though there are two slices, one stacked perfectly atop the other. But, if you open the sandwich and place the two slices side by side, you get twice the surface area. The Gorter and Grendel experiment is basically the same idea.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Blue whales are the largest animals
that have ever roamed the planet. They’re at least two times 
as big as the biggest dinosaurs— “that’s big!“— the length of a basketball court, and as heavy as 40 African elephants. If that’s not enough to make you marvel,
here’s something that will. They’ve grown to this enormous size by feeding exclusively on tiny shrimp-like
creatures called krill— that are no bigger 
than your little finger. In many ways, the sheer size of krill seems to have driven 
the evolution of the blue whale. See, krill are so small
but are found in dense patches. For increased efficiency, blue whales have evolved to use 
a feeding strategy called lunge feeding. Basically, 
the whale accelerates towards a prey patch and opens its mouth wide. To increase the capacity, 
its mouth expands. The special, accordion-like 
blubber layer that extends from its snout 
to its belly button enables the whale to engulf 
large quantities of prey-laden water. With each giant gulp, the whale takes in 125% of its body weight
in water and krill. The whale must then expel the water
while retaining the yummy krill. To do this, it uses its baleen, the comb-like structure made of the same 
stuff our nails and hair are made of, and its tongue. It’s pretty crazy that the blue whale’s 
heart is as big as a small car, a child could crawl through its arteries, its tongue weighs as much as an elephant, but its esophagus is so small, the whale could choke on a loaf of bread. These whales are really not designed 
to feed on anything larger than krill. It’s estimated that blue whales eat 
four tons of krill per day. Because of their incredible design, each dive provides the blue whale 
with 90 times as much energy as is used. Every mouthful of krill provides 
almost 480,000 calories, the same amount you get 
from eating 1,900 hamburgers. But, why are blue whales so big? Blue whales are considerably larger
than the largest living land animal, the elephant. The heavier an animal is, the greater its relative surface area. As weight increases, there’s a point at which the legs 
of that animal would simply collapse. That explains why elephants don’t stand 
on the delicate legs of a horse. They need legs shaped like stout pedestals to hold their bodies up against gravity. In water, the situation 
is quite different. Buoyancy counteracts 
the gravitational pull on the body and their great bulk is therefore 
partially supported by the water. So, the ocean is a great place for species
that want to grow bigger. The other secret to their size
is their diet. By evolving such a huge mouth, the whale’s have specialized to catch 
enormous quantities of highly abundant and nutritious prey, which provides the energy needed 
to grow so big. But, now maybe you’re wondering
why blue whales aren’t any bigger? After all, the ocean sounds like nirvana
for any growing beast. Well, while lunge feeding may 
have allowed blue whales to become the biggest animal 
to have ever roamed the planet, by enabling them to feed efficiently 
in dense prey patches, it isn't cost free. Scientists compared all the costs 
involved with lunge feeding to the energy gained 
from the krill they eat. What they found is that when the whale’s 
body increases in size, the energy that body demands rises faster than the extra energy they get 
from their food. Feeding whales needs 15 times the energy 
required to remain still and 5 times more energy 
than used when swimming. Calculations show that the largest 
a lunge feeder can grow is 33 meters, pretty much blue whale size. Turns out blue whales have a lot
to thank krill for: neat, evolutionary adaptations that would 
not have been possible if krill were not so small. It’s incredible that these tiny creatures 
have allowed blue whales to really push the limits 
of size on our planet. Makes you wonder if that old adage, 
“you are what you eat,” really does apply in blue whale world.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Blue whales are the largest animals
that have ever roamed the planet. They’re at least two times 
as big as the biggest dinosaurs— “that’s big!“— the length of a basketball court, and as heavy as 40 African elephants. If that’s not enough to make you marvel,
here’s something that will. They’ve grown to this enormous size by feeding exclusively on tiny shrimp-like
creatures called krill— that are no bigger 
than your little finger. In many ways, the sheer size of krill seems to have driven 
the evolution of the blue whale. See, krill are so small
but are found in dense patches. For increased efficiency, blue whales have evolved to use 
a feeding strategy called lunge feeding. Basically, 
the whale accelerates towards a prey patch and opens its mouth wide. To increase the capacity, 
its mouth expands. The special, accordion-like 
blubber layer that extends from its snout 
to its belly button enables the whale to engulf 
large quantities of prey-laden water. With each giant gulp, the whale takes in 125% of its body weight
in water and krill. The whale must then expel the water
while retaining the yummy krill. To do this, it uses its baleen, the comb-like structure made of the same 
stuff our nails and hair are made of, and its tongue. It’s pretty crazy that the blue whale’s 
heart is as big as a small car, a child could crawl through its arteries, its tongue weighs as much as an elephant, but its esophagus is so small, the whale could choke on a loaf of bread. These whales are really not designed 
to feed on anything larger than krill. It’s estimated that blue whales eat 
four tons of krill per day. Because of their incredible design, each dive provides the blue whale 
with 90 times as much energy as is used. Every mouthful of krill provides 
almost 480,000 calories, the same amount you get 
from eating 1,900 hamburgers. But, why are blue whales so big? Blue whales are considerably larger
than the largest living land animal, the elephant. The heavier an animal is, the greater its relative surface area. As weight increases, there’s a point at which the legs 
of that animal would simply collapse. That explains why elephants don’t stand 
on the delicate legs of a horse. They need legs shaped like stout pedestals to hold their bodies up against gravity. In water, the situation 
is quite different. Buoyancy counteracts 
the gravitational pull on the body and their great bulk is therefore 
partially supported by the water. So, the ocean is a great place for species
that want to grow bigger. The other secret to their size
is their diet. By evolving such a huge mouth, the whale’s have specialized to catch 
enormous quantities of highly abundant and nutritious prey, which provides the energy needed 
to grow so big. But, now maybe you’re wondering
why blue whales aren’t any bigger? After all, the ocean sounds like nirvana
for any growing beast. Well, while lunge feeding may 
have allowed blue whales to become the biggest animal 
to have ever roamed the planet, by enabling them to feed efficiently 
in dense prey patches, it isn't cost free. Scientists compared all the costs 
involved with lunge feeding to the energy gained 
from the krill they eat. What they found is that when the whale’s 
body increases in size, the energy that body demands rises faster than the extra energy they get 
from their food. Feeding whales needs 15 times the energy 
required to remain still and 5 times more energy 
than used when swimming. Calculations show that the largest 
a lunge feeder can grow is 33 meters, pretty much blue whale size. Turns out blue whales have a lot
to thank krill for: neat, evolutionary adaptations that would 
not have been possible if krill were not so small. It’s incredible that these tiny creatures 
have allowed blue whales to really push the limits 
of size on our planet. Makes you wonder if that old adage, 
“you are what you eat,” really does apply in blue whale world.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Music] the brilliant playright audrianne Kennedy wrote a volume called people who have led my plays and if I were to write a volume it would be called artists who have led my exhibitions because my work in understanding art and in understanding culture has come by following artists by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are JJ from Good Times significant to many people of course because of Dino might but perhaps more significant as the first really black artist on prime time TV Jean Michelle basat important to me because the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what I was about to enter into my overall project is about art specifically about black artists very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves my interest is an artists who understand and rewrite history who think about themselves within The Narrative of the larger world of art but who have created new places for us to see and understand I'm showing two artists here Glenn Ligon and Carol Walker two of many who really form for me the essential questions that I wanted to bring as a curator to the world I was interested in the idea of why and how I could create create a new story a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world and to do this I knew that I had to see the way in which artists work understand the artist studio as a laboratory imagine then Reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper asking questions providing the space to look and to think about answers in 1994 when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum I made an exhibition called blackmail it looked at the intersection of race and gender in Contemporary American art it sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for a dialogue complicated dialogue dialogue with many many points of entry and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas this exhibition included over 20 artists of various ages and races but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view what was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator as a catalyst for this dialogue one of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people's understanding of themselves and each other I'm showing you two works one on the right by Leon golb one on the left by Robert kscott and in the course of the exhibition which was contentious controversial and ultimately for me life-changing in my sense of what art could be a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other and she pointed to the work on the Left To Tell me how problematic this image was as it related for her to the idea of how black people had been represented and she pointed to the image on the right as an example to me of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media she then assigned these Works racial identities basically saying to me that the work on the right clearly was made by a black artists the work on the left clearly by a white artist went in effect that was the opposite case Bob kott African-American artist Leon golb uh a a white artist the point of that for me was to say in that space in that moment that I really more than anything wanted to understand how images could work how images did work and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives to work through these images fast forward and I end up in Harlem home for many of Black America very much the psychic heart of the black experience really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed Harlem now s of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century looking both backwards and forwards I always say Harlem is an interesting Community because unlike many other places it thinks of itself in the past present and the future simultaneously no one speaks of it just in the now it's always what it was and what it can be and in thinking about that then my second project the second question I ask is can a museum be a catalyst in a community can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves this is Harlem actually on January 20th thinking about itself in a very wonderful way so I work now at the studio Museum in Harlem thinking about exhibitions there thinking about what it means to discover Arts possibility now what does this mean to some of you in some cases I know that many of you are involved in cross-cultural dialogues you're involved in ideas of creativity and Innovation think about the place that artists can play in that that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that I work towards in working with young black artists think about artists not as content providers though they can be brilliant at that but again as real Catalyst the studio Museum was founded in the late 60s and I bring this up because it's important to locate this practice in history to look at 1968 in the incredible historic moment that is and think of the arc that has happened since then to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this Museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the leg Legacy of important African-American artists to the history of Art in this country like Jacob Lawrence Norman Lewis ramir Bearden and then of course to bring us to today in 1975 Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University after his lecture this A student got up and said to him give us a poem and Muhammad Ali said me we a profound statement about the individual and the community the space in which now in my project of discovery of thinking about artists of trying to Define what might be black art cultural movement of the 21st century what that might mean for cultural movements all over in this moment the miwe seems incredibly precient totally important to this end the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an F freestyle frequency and flow which have set out to discover and Define the young black artist working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years this series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now at this point in history to see art as a catalyst what it means now at this point in history as we Define and redefine culture Black Culture specifically in my case but culture generally I named this group of artists around an idea which I put out there called post black really meant to Define them as artists who came and start their work now looking back at history but star in this moment historically it is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking this new set of questions is what does it mean right now to be africanamerican in America what can artwork say about this where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation really most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring their works for me are about not always just simply about the aesthetic Innovation that their minds imagine that they Visions create and put out there in the world but more perhaps importantly through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation as well as in the future I am continually Amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be I am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work it is why I Look to Art it's why I ask questions of art it is why I make exhibitions now this exhibition as I said 40 Young Artists done over a course of eight years and for me it's about considering the implications it's considering the implications of this generation has to say to the rest of us it's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as work travels but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us it's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it and imagining particularly in urban America about the nurturing of this Spirit now where perhaps does this end up right now for me it is about reimagining this cultural discourse in an international context so the last iteration of this project has been call flow with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world really looking not so much from Harlem and out but looking across and Flo looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa and as many of us think about that continent and think about what it means to us all in the 21st century I have begun that looking through artists through artworks and imagining what they can tell us about the future with they tell us about our future and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue so what do I discover when I look at artworks what do I think about when I think about art I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works the discovery of exciting works but really it has been what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition to talk about beauty to talk about power to talk about ourselves and to talk and speak to each other that's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world thank [Applause] [Music] you

related for her to the idea of how black people had been represented and she pointed to the image on the right as an example to me of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media she then assigned these Works racial identities basically saying to me that the work on the right clearly was made by a black artists the work on the left clearly by a white artist went in effect that was the opposite case Bob kott African-American artist Leon golb uh a a white artist the point of that for me was to say in that space in that moment that I really more than anything wanted to understand how images could work how images did work and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives to work through these images fast forward and I end up in Harlem home for many of Black America very much the psychic heart of the black experience really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed Harlem now s of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century looking both backwards and forwards I always say Harlem is an interesting Community because unlike many other places it thinks of itself in the past present and the future simultaneously no one speaks of it just in the now it's always what it was and what it can be and in thinking about that then my second project the second question I ask is can a museum be a catalyst in a community can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves this is Harlem actually on January 20th thinking about itself in a very wonderful way so I work now at the studio Museum in Harlem thinking about exhibitions there thinking about what it means to discover Arts possibility now what does this mean to some of you in some cases I know that many of you are involved in cross-cultural dialogues you're involved in ideas of creativity and Innovation think about the place that artists can play in that that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that I work towards in working with young black artists think about artists not as content providers though they can be brilliant at that but again as real Catalyst the studio Museum was founded in the late 60s and I bring this up because it's important to locate this practice in history to look at 1968 in the incredible historic moment that is and think of the arc that has happened since then to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this Museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the leg Legacy of important African-American artists to the history of Art in this country like Jacob Lawrence Norman Lewis ramir Bearden and then of course to bring us to today in 1975 Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University after his lecture this A student got up and said to him give us a poem and Muhammad Ali said me we a profound statement about the individual and the community the space in which now in my project of discovery of thinking about artists of trying to Define what might be black art cultural movement of the 21st century what that might mean for cultural movements all over in this moment the miwe seems incredibly precient totally important to this end the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an F freestyle frequency and flow which have set out to discover and Define the young black artist working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years this series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now at this point in history to see art as a catalyst what it means now at this point in history as we Define and redefine culture Black Culture specifically in my case but culture generally I named this group of artists around an idea which I put out there called post black really meant to Define them as artists who came and start their work now looking back at history but star in this moment historically it is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking this new set of questions is what does it mean right now to be africanamerican in America what can artwork say about this where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation really most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring their works for me are about not always just simply about the aesthetic Innovation that their minds imagine that they Visions create and put out there in the world but more perhaps importantly through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation as well as in the future I am continually Amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be I am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work it is why I Look to Art it's why I ask questions of art it is why I make exhibitions now this exhibition as I said 40 Young Artists done over a course of eight years and for me it's about considering the implications it's considering the implications of this generation has to say to the rest of us it's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as work travels but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us it's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it and imagining particularly in urban America about the nurturing of this Spirit now where perhaps does this end up right now for me it is about reimagining this cultural discourse in an international context so the last iteration of this project has been call flow with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world really looking not so much from Harlem and out but looking across and Flo looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa and as many of us think about that continent and think about what it means to us all in the 21st century I have begun that looking through artists through artworks and imagining what they can tell us about the future with they tell us about our future and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue so what do I discover when I look at artworks what do I think about when I think about art I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works the discovery of exciting works but really it has been what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition to talk about beauty to talk about power to talk about ourselves and to talk and speak to each other that's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world thank [Applause] [Music] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Music] the brilliant playright audrianne Kennedy wrote a volume called people who have led my plays and if I were to write a volume it would be called artists who have led my exhibitions because my work in understanding art and in understanding culture has come by following artists by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are JJ from Good Times significant to many people of course because of Dino might but perhaps more significant as the first really black artist on prime time TV Jean Michelle basat important to me because the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what I was about to enter into my overall project is about art specifically about black artists very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves my interest is an artists who understand and rewrite history who think about themselves within The Narrative of the larger world of art but who have created new places for us to see and understand I'm showing two artists here Glenn Ligon and Carol Walker two of many who really form for me the essential questions that I wanted to bring as a curator to the world I was interested in the idea of why and how I could create create a new story a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world and to do this I knew that I had to see the way in which artists work understand the artist studio as a laboratory imagine then Reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper asking questions providing the space to look and to think about answers in 1994 when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum I made an exhibition called blackmail it looked at the intersection of race and gender in Contemporary American art it sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for a dialogue complicated dialogue dialogue with many many points of entry and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas this exhibition included over 20 artists of various ages and races but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view what was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator as a catalyst for this dialogue one of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people's understanding of themselves and each other I'm showing you two works one on the right by Leon golb one on the left by Robert kscott and in the course of the exhibition which was contentious controversial and ultimately for me life-changing in my sense of what art could be a woman came up to me on the gallery

**Transcript**:
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe the child remains nonverbal all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers and I actually feel at home here because it's a lot of autism genetics here you wouldn't have any it's a continuum of traits when does a nerd turn into you know Asperger which is just mild autism I mean Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today and one of the things that really is going to concern me is getting these kids to to be the ones that are going to invent the next two energy things now that Bill Gates talked about this morning okay now if you want to understand autism animals and I want to talk to you about different ways of thinking you have to get away from verbal language I think in pictures I don't think in language now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details okay this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or pick out the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly and the thing is the normal brain ignores the details well if you're building a fridge details are pretty important because I'll fall down if you ignore the details and one of my big concerns is a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract people are getting away from doing hands-on stuff I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes because art and classes like that those are the classes where I accept okay in my work with cattle I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle book like for example is flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility this feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility all they needed to do was move the flag rapid movement contrast in the early 70s when I started I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing people thought that was crazy a code on offense would make em block shadows would make them bark a whole was on the floor people weren't noticing these things a chain hanging down and that's shown very very nicely in the movie in fact I loved the movie how they duplicated all my projects that's the geek side my drawings got the star in the movie too and actually it's called Temple Grandin not thinking in pictures so what is thinking in pictures it's literally movies in your hat my mind works like Google for Images now when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different I thought everybody thought in pictures and then when I did my book thinking in pictures I started interviewing people about how they think you know shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different like if I say think about a church steeple most people get this sort of generalized generic one now maybe that's not true in this room but it's going to be true in a lot of different places I see only specific pictures they flash up into my memory just like Google for pictures and in the movie they've got a great scene in there where the word shoe is said in a whole bunch of 50s and 60s shoes pop into my imagination okay there's my childhood Church that's specific there's some more Fort Collins okay how about famous ones and they just kind of come up kind of like this just really quickly like Google for pictures and they come up one at a time and then I think well okay well maybe we can have it snow or we can have a thunderstorm I can hold it there and turn them into videos now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities and I've worked really hard on improving on how cattle are treated at slaughter plant I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it but one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind just like a virtual reality computer system and this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie that was like just so super cool and there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and I had autism types working out there on the movie set too but one of the things that really worries me is where's the younger version of those kids going today they're not ending up in Silicon Valley where they belong now one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social is I had to sell my work and not myself and the way I sold livestock jobs as I showed off my drawings I showed off pictures of things another thing that helped me as a little kid is boy in the 50s you were taught manners you were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in a store and throw it around now when kids get to be in third or fourth grade you might see that this kid's gonna be a visual thinker drawing in perspective now I want to emphasize that not every autistic kids going to be a visual thinker now I did the head this brain scan done several years ago and I used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going a deep into my visual cortex this is tensor imaging and my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the controls the red lines there are me and the blue lines are the sex and age matched control and there I got a gigantic one and the control over there the blue one has got a really small one and some of the research now is showing that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex now the thing is the visual thinker is just one kind of mind you see the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind good at one thing they added something else and when I was bad with algebra and I was never allowed to take geometry or trig gigantic mistake I'm finding a lot of kids that need to skip algebra go right to geometry and trick now another kind of mind is the pattern thinker more abstract these are your engineers your computer programmers now this is pattern thinking that praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper no scotch tape no cuts and there in the background is the pattern for folding it here are the types of thinking photorealistic visual thinkers like me pattern thinkers music and math minds some of these oftentimes have problems with reading you also will see these kind of problems with them kids that are dyslexic you'll see these different kinds of minds and then there's a verbal mind they know every fact about everything now another thing is the sensory issues I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face and I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it and like they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin but sensory is an issue some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights others have problems with sound sensitivity you know on it's going to be variable now visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind because think about it an animal's a sensory based think are not verbal thinks in pictures thinks and sounds thinks and smells think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant he knows who's been there when they were there are they friend or foe is there anybody they'll mate with there's a ton of information on that fire hydrant it's all very detailed information and looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals now the animal mind and also my mind puts sensory-based information into categories man on a horse and a man on the ground that is viewed as two totally different things you can have a horse that's been abused by a rider they'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with a horse sure but you can't ride you have another horse where maybe the horseshoer beat them up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground or the veterinarian but a person can ride them cattle are the same way man on a horse a man on foot there are two different things you see it's a different picture see I want you to think about just how specific this is now this ability to put information into categories I find a lot of people are not very good at this like when I'm out troubleshooting with equipment or problems with something in a plant they don't seem to be able to figure out do I have a training people issue or do I have something wrong with the equipment in other words categorizing equipment problem from a people problem I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that now let's say I figure out is an equipment problem is it a minor problem with something simple I can fix or is a whole design of the system wrong people have a hard time figuring that out let's just look at something like you know solving problems with y'all making airlines safer yeah I'm a million-mile flyer I do lots and lots of flying and then you know like if I was at the FFA what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of it would be their airplane tails you know five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years tail either came off or coasteering stuff inside the tail broke in some way its tails pure and simple and when the pilots walk around the plane guess what they can't see that stuff inside the tail you know now as I think about that I'm pulling up all of that you know specific information it's specific see my thinking's bottom up I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle now here's a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats you've been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat white cowboy hats that was absolutely fine now the thing is the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together we've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds and one of the things that's driving me really crazy so I travel around than I do autism meetings is I'm seeing a lot of smart geeky nerdy kids and they just aren't very social and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science this brings up the whole thing on my science teacher my science teacher has shown absolutely beautifully in the movie as a goof ball student when I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying until I had on mr. carlock's science class he was now dr. Carlock in the movie and he he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room this brings up the whole thing he got to show kids interesting stuff you know one of the things that I think maybe Ted ought to do is done tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on Ted there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids and the teachers out in the Midwest and other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas they don't know they do with these kids and they're not going down the right path the thing is you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind or a mind can be wired to be more social and what some of the research now is showing autism is there may be extra wiring back here and then really brilliant mine and we lose a few social circuits here it's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social and then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be nonverbal in the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals this is the work of dr. Bruce Miller and he studied alzheimerís patients they had frontal temporal lobe dementia and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain and then this artwork came out of somebody that used to install stereos and cars now van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this Eddy pattern and his painting followed a statistical model of turbulence this brings up a whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head and the Wolfram stuff I was taking notes I was write down all the all the search words I could use because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures we've got a show these kids to interesting stuff and they've taken out the auto shop class and the drafting class in the art class I mean art was my best subject in school we've got to think about all these different kinds of minds and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future and let's talk about jobs okay my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball it didn't want to study but you know what I was getting work experience I'm seeing too many these smart kids that haven't learned basic things like how to be on time I was taught that when I was eight years old you know how to have table manners at Granny's at Sunday party I was taught that when I was very very young and when I was 13 I had a job at a dressmakers shop by selling clothes I did internships in college I did I was building things and I also had to learn how to do assignments you know all I want to do is draw pictures the horses when I was little mother said well let's do a picture of something else they got to learn how to do something else let's say the kids fixated on leg let's get them working on building different things think about the autistic mind as it tends to be fixated like if the kid loves race cars let's use race cars for math let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance in other words use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that's one of the things we need to do and really get fed up when the you know the teachers when especially when you get away from this part of the country they don't know what to do with these smart kids it just drives me crazy what can visual thinkers do when they grow up they can do graphic design all kinds of stuff with computers photography Industrial Design on the pattern thinkers they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers all of those kinds of jobs and then you've got the word minds they make great journalists and they're also make really really good stage actors because the thing about being autistic is I had to learn social skills like being in a play it just kind of just have to learn it and we need to be working with these students and this brings up mentors you know my science teacher was not an accredited teacher he was a NASA space scientist now some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or degree in chemistry you can come into the school and teach you know biology or chemistry we need to be doing that because what I'm observing is the good teachers for a lot of these kids are out in the community colleges but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools another thing that can be very very very successful is there's a lot of people that may have retired from you know working in the software industry and they can teach a kid and it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark you get nected turned on and you get them turned on then you'll learn all the new stuff mentors are just essential I can't emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me and we've got to mentor them hire them and if you bring them in for internships and your company's the thing about the autism Asperger II kind of mine you got to give a specific task don't just say design new software you're going to tell them something a lot more specific well we're designing a software for phone and it has to do some specific thing and it can only use so much memory that's the kind of specificity you need well that's the end of my talk and I just want to thank everybody for coming it was great to be here oh yeah question for me okay thank you thank you so much for that you know you once wrote I like this quote if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave hey guys who do you think made the first stone spear Jose Asperger guy and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetic said they know more Silicon Valley and the energy crisis would not be solved someone shot you a couple of the questions and you know if any of these feel inappropriate it's okay to say next question but if if there's someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them what advice would you give them well first of all I got a look at age if you have a two three or four year old you know no speech no social interaction I can't emphasize enough don't wait you need to at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching you know thing as autism comes in different degrees there's going about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn the talk and they're not gonna be working in Silicon Valley that would that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do but then you got these smart geeky kids you know the touch of autism and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things I got social interaction through shared interests I rode horses with other kids I made model rockets with other kids did electronics lab you know without the kids and then 60s it was gluing mirrors on the under rubber membrane on speaker to make a light shell that was like we can serve that super cool look is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them as some might most well let me tell you that child will be loyal if the house is burning down they're gonna get you out of it Wow so most people if you ask them what are they most passionate about that say things like my kids or or my lover or what are you most passionate about I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place when I have a mother of an autistic child say my kid went to college because of your book or something or wanting our lectures that makes me happy you know like the slaughter plants I've worked with them in the 80s they were absolutely awful I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many cattle got poked with the Prada how many cattle are moving their heads off and it's very very simple you met you directly observe a few simple things it's worked really well I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world we need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stone what are you talking on the phone one of the things you said that really astonished me was he said one thing you were passionate about was server farms talk about the reason why I got really excited I read about that it's contains knowledge its libraries and to me knowledge is something that is extremely valuable so maybe over 10 years ago now our library got flooded this is before the internet got really big and I was really upset of all the books being wrecked because it was knowledge being destroyed and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge temple can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at Ted well thank you so much thank you

now this ability to put information into categories I find a lot of people are not very good at this like when I'm out troubleshooting with equipment or problems with something in a plant they don't

building things and I also had to learn how to do assignments you know all I want to do is draw pictures the horses when I was little mother said well let's do a picture of something else they got to learn how to do something else let's say the kids fixated on leg let's get them working on building different things think about the autistic mind as it tends to be fixated like if the kid loves race cars let's use race cars for math let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance in other words use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that's one of the things we need to do and really get fed up when the you know the teachers when especially when you get away from this part of the country they don't know what to do with these smart kids it just drives me crazy what can visual thinkers do when they grow up they can do graphic design all kinds of stuff with computers photography Industrial Design on the pattern thinkers they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers all of those kinds of jobs and then you've got the word minds they make great journalists and they're also make really really good stage actors because the thing about being autistic is I had to learn social skills like being in a play it just kind of just have to learn it and we need to be working with these students and this brings up mentors you know my science teacher was not an accredited teacher he was a NASA space scientist now some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or degree in chemistry you can come into the school and teach you know biology or chemistry we need to be doing that because what I'm observing is the good teachers for a lot of these kids are out in the community colleges but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools another thing that can be very very very successful is there's a lot of people that may have retired from you know working in the software industry and they can teach a kid and it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark you get nected turned on and you get them turned on then you'll learn all the new stuff mentors are just essential I can't emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me and we've got to mentor them hire them and if you bring them in for internships and your company's the thing about the autism Asperger II kind of mine you got to give a specific task don't just say design new software you're going to tell them something a lot more specific well we're designing a software for phone and it has to do some specific thing and it can only use so much memory that's the kind of specificity you need well that's the end of my talk and I just want to thank everybody for coming it was great to be here oh yeah question for me okay thank you thank you so much for that you know you once wrote I like this quote if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave hey guys who do you think made the first stone spear Jose Asperger guy and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetic said they know more Silicon Valley and the energy crisis would not be solved someone shot you a couple of the questions and you know if any of these feel inappropriate it's okay to say next question but if if there's someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them what advice would you give them well first of all I got a look at age if you have a two three or four year old you know no speech no social interaction I can't emphasize enough don't wait you need to at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching you know thing as autism comes in different degrees there's going about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn the talk and they're not gonna be working in Silicon Valley that would that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do but then you got these smart geeky kids you know the touch of autism and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things I got social interaction through shared interests I rode horses with other kids I made model rockets with other kids did electronics lab you know without the kids and then 60s it was gluing mirrors on the under rubber membrane on speaker to make a light shell that was like we can serve that super cool look is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them as some might most well let me tell you that child will be loyal if the house is burning down they're gonna get you out of it Wow so most people if you ask them what are they most passionate about that say things like my kids or or my lover or what are you most passionate about I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place when I have a mother of an autistic child say my kid went to college because of your book or something or wanting our lectures that makes me happy you know like the slaughter plants I've worked with them in the 80s they were absolutely awful I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many cattle got poked with the Prada how many cattle are moving their heads off and it's very very simple you met you directly observe a few simple things it's worked really well I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world we need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stone what are you talking on the phone one of the things you said that really astonished me was he said one thing you were passionate about was server farms talk about the reason why I got really excited I read about that it's contains knowledge its libraries and to me knowledge is something that is extremely valuable so maybe over 10 years ago now our library got flooded this is before the internet got really big and I was really upset of all the books being wrecked because it was knowledge being destroyed and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge temple can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at Ted well thank you so much thank you

**Transcript**:
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe the child remains nonverbal all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers and I actually feel at home here because it's a lot of autism genetics here you wouldn't have any it's a continuum of traits when does a nerd turn into you know Asperger which is just mild autism I mean Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today and one of the things that really is going to concern me is getting these kids to to be the ones that are going to invent the next two energy things now that Bill Gates talked about this morning okay now if you want to understand autism animals and I want to talk to you about different ways of thinking you have to get away from verbal language I think in pictures I don't think in language now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details okay this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or pick out the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly and the thing is the normal brain ignores the details well if you're building a fridge details are pretty important because I'll fall down if you ignore the details and one of my big concerns is a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract people are getting away from doing hands-on stuff I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes because art and classes like that those are the classes where I accept okay in my work with cattle I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle book like for example is flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility this feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility all they needed to do was move the flag rapid movement contrast in the early 70s when I started I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing people thought that was crazy a code on offense would make em block shadows would make them bark a whole was on the floor people weren't noticing these things a chain hanging down and that's shown very very nicely in the movie in fact I loved the movie how they duplicated all my projects that's the geek side my drawings got the star in the movie too and actually it's called Temple Grandin not thinking in pictures so what is thinking in pictures it's literally movies in your hat my mind works like Google for Images now when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different I thought everybody thought in pictures and then when I did my book thinking in pictures I started interviewing people about how they think you know shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different like if I say think about a church steeple most people get this sort of generalized generic one now maybe that's not true in this room but it's going to be true in a lot of different places I see only specific pictures they flash up into my memory just like Google for pictures and in the movie they've got a great scene in there where the word shoe is said in a whole bunch of 50s and 60s shoes pop into my imagination okay there's my childhood Church that's specific there's some more Fort Collins okay how about famous ones and they just kind of come up kind of like this just really quickly like Google for pictures and they come up one at a time and then I think well okay well maybe we can have it snow or we can have a thunderstorm I can hold it there and turn them into videos now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities and I've worked really hard on improving on how cattle are treated at slaughter plant I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it but one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind just like a virtual reality computer system and this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie that was like just so super cool and there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and I had autism types working out there on the movie set too but one of the things that really worries me is where's the younger version of those kids going today they're not ending up in Silicon Valley where they belong now one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social is I had to sell my work and not myself and the way I sold livestock jobs as I showed off my drawings I showed off pictures of things another thing that helped me as a little kid is boy in the 50s you were taught manners you were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in a store and throw it around now when kids get to be in third or fourth grade you might see that this kid's gonna be a visual thinker drawing in perspective now I want to emphasize that not every autistic kids going to be a visual thinker now I did the head this brain scan done several years ago and I used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going a deep into my visual cortex this is tensor imaging and my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the controls the red lines there are me and the blue lines are the sex and age matched control and there I got a gigantic one and the control over there the blue one has got a really small one and some of the research now is showing that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex now the thing is the visual thinker is just one kind of mind you see the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind good at one thing they added something else and when I was bad with algebra and I was never allowed to take geometry or trig gigantic mistake I'm finding a lot of kids that need to skip algebra go right to geometry and trick now another kind of mind is the pattern thinker more abstract these are your engineers your computer programmers now this is pattern thinking that praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper no scotch tape no cuts and there in the background is the pattern for folding it here are the types of thinking photorealistic visual thinkers like me pattern thinkers music and math minds some of these oftentimes have problems with reading you also will see these kind of problems with them kids that are dyslexic you'll see these different kinds of minds and then there's a verbal mind they know every fact about everything now another thing is the sensory issues I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face and I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it and like they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin but sensory is an issue some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights others have problems with sound sensitivity you know on it's going to be variable now visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind because think about it an animal's a sensory based think are not verbal thinks in pictures thinks and sounds thinks and smells think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant he knows who's been there when they were there are they friend or foe is there anybody they'll mate with there's a ton of information on that fire hydrant it's all very detailed information and looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals now the animal mind and also my mind puts sensory-based information into categories man on a horse and a man on the ground that is viewed as two totally different things you can have a horse that's been abused by a rider they'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with a horse sure but you can't ride you have another horse where maybe the horseshoer beat them up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground or the veterinarian but a person can ride them cattle are the same way man on a horse a man on foot there are two different things you see it's a different picture see I want you to think about just how specific this is now this ability to put information into categories I find a lot of people are not very good at this like when I'm out troubleshooting with equipment or problems with something in a plant they don't seem to be able to figure out do I have a training people issue or do I have something wrong with the equipment in other words categorizing equipment problem from a people problem I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that now let's say I figure out is an equipment problem is it a minor problem with something simple I can fix or is a whole design of the system wrong people have a hard time figuring that out let's just look at something like you know solving problems with y'all making airlines safer yeah I'm a million-mile flyer I do lots and lots of flying and then you know like if I was at the FFA what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of it would be their airplane tails you know five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years tail either came off or coasteering stuff inside the tail broke in some way its tails pure and simple and when the pilots walk around the plane guess what they can't see that stuff inside the tail you know now as I think about that I'm pulling up all of that you know specific information it's specific see my thinking's bottom up I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle now here's a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats you've been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat white cowboy hats that was absolutely fine now the thing is the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together we've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds and one of the things that's driving me really crazy so I travel around than I do autism meetings is I'm seeing a lot of smart geeky nerdy kids and they just aren't very social and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science this brings up the whole thing on my science teacher my science teacher has shown absolutely beautifully in the movie as a goof ball student when I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying until I had on mr. carlock's science class he was now dr. Carlock in the movie and he he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room this brings up the whole thing he got to show kids interesting stuff you know one of the things that I think maybe Ted ought to do is done tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on Ted there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids and the teachers out in the Midwest and other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas they don't know they do with these kids and they're not going down the right path the thing is you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind or a mind can be wired to be more social and what some of the research now is showing autism is there may be extra wiring back here and then really brilliant mine and we lose a few social circuits here it's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social and then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be nonverbal in the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals this is the work of dr. Bruce Miller and he studied alzheimerís patients they had frontal temporal lobe dementia and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain and then this artwork came out of somebody that used to install stereos and cars now van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this Eddy pattern and his painting followed a statistical model of turbulence this brings up a whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head and the Wolfram stuff I was taking notes I was write down all the all the search words I could use because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures we've got a show these kids to interesting stuff and they've taken out the auto shop class and the drafting class in the art class I mean art was my best subject in school we've got to think about all these different kinds of minds and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future and let's talk about jobs okay my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball it didn't want to study but you know what I was getting work experience I'm seeing too many these smart kids that haven't learned basic things like how to be on time I was taught that when I was eight years old you know how to have table manners at Granny's at Sunday party I was taught that when I was very very young and when I was 13 I had a job at a dressmakers shop by selling clothes I did internships in college I did I was building things and I also had to learn how to do assignments you know all I want to do is draw pictures the horses when I was little mother said well let's do a picture of something else they got to learn how to do something else let's say the kids fixated on leg let's get them working on building different things think about the autistic mind as it tends to be fixated like if the kid loves race cars let's use race cars for math let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance in other words use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that's one of the things we need to do and really get fed up when the you know the teachers when especially when you get away from this part of the country they don't know what to do with these smart kids it just drives me crazy what can visual thinkers do when they grow up they can do graphic design all kinds of stuff with computers photography Industrial Design on the pattern thinkers they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers all of those kinds of jobs and then you've got the word minds they make great journalists and they're also make really really good stage actors because the thing about being autistic is I had to learn social skills like being in a play it just kind of just have to learn it and we need to be working with these students and this brings up mentors you know my science teacher was not an accredited teacher he was a NASA space scientist now some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or degree in chemistry you can come into the school and teach you know biology or chemistry we need to be doing that because what I'm observing is the good teachers for a lot of these kids are out in the community colleges but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools another thing that can be very very very successful is there's a lot of people that may have retired from you know working in the software industry and they can teach a kid and it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark you get nected turned on and you get them turned on then you'll learn all the new stuff mentors are just essential I can't emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me and we've got to mentor them hire them and if you bring them in for internships and your company's the thing about the autism Asperger II kind of mine you got to give a specific task don't just say design new software you're going to tell them something a lot more specific well we're designing a software for phone and it has to do some specific thing and it can only use so much memory that's the kind of specificity you need well that's the end of my talk and I just want to thank everybody for coming it was great to be here oh yeah question for me okay thank you thank you so much for that you know you once wrote I like this quote if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave hey guys who do you think made the first stone spear Jose Asperger guy and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetic said they know more Silicon Valley and the energy crisis would not be solved someone shot you a couple of the questions and you know

that child loves them as some might most well let me tell you that child will be loyal if the house is burning down they're gonna get you out of it Wow so most people if you ask them what are they most passionate about that say things like my kids or or my lover or what are you most passionate about I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place when I have a mother of an autistic child say my kid went to college because of your book or something or wanting our lectures that makes me happy you know like the slaughter plants I've worked with them in the 80s they were absolutely awful I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many cattle got poked with the Prada how

maybe over 10 years ago now our library got flooded this is before the internet got really big and I was really upset of all the books being wrecked because it was knowledge being destroyed and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge temple can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at Ted well thank you so much thank you

turn them into videos now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities and I've worked really hard on improving on how cattle are treated at slaughter plant I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it but one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind just like a virtual reality computer system and this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie that was like just so super cool and there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and I had autism types working out there on the movie set too but one of the things that really worries me is where's the younger version of those kids going today they're not ending up in Silicon Valley where they belong now one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social is I had to sell my work and not myself and the way I sold livestock jobs as I showed off my drawings I showed off pictures of things another thing that helped me as a little kid is boy in the 50s you were taught manners you were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in a store and throw it around now when kids get to be in third or fourth grade you might see that this kid's gonna be a visual thinker drawing in perspective now I want to emphasize that not every autistic kids going to be a visual thinker now I did the head this brain scan done several years ago and I used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going a deep into my visual cortex this is tensor imaging and my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the controls the red lines there are me and the blue lines are the sex and age matched control and there I got a gigantic one and the control over there the blue one has got a really small one and some of the research now is showing that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex now the thing is the visual thinker is just one kind of mind you see the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind good at one thing they added something else and when I was bad with algebra and I was never allowed to take geometry or trig gigantic mistake I'm finding a lot of kids that need to skip algebra go right to geometry and trick now another kind of mind is the pattern thinker more abstract these are your engineers your computer programmers now this is pattern thinking that praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper no scotch tape no cuts and there in the background is the pattern for folding it here are the types of thinking photorealistic visual thinkers like me pattern thinkers music and math minds some of these oftentimes have problems with reading you also will see these kind of problems with them kids that are dyslexic you'll see these different kinds of minds and then there's a verbal mind they know every fact about everything now another thing is the sensory issues I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face and I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it and like they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin but sensory is an issue some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights others have problems with sound sensitivity you know on it's going to be variable now visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind because think about it an animal's a sensory based think are not verbal thinks in pictures thinks and sounds thinks and smells think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant he knows who's been there when they were there are they friend or foe is there anybody they'll mate with there's a ton of information on that fire hydrant it's all very detailed information and looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals now the animal mind and also my mind puts sensory-based information into categories man on a horse and a man on the ground that is viewed as two totally different things you can have a horse that's been abused by a rider they'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with a horse sure but you can't ride you have another horse where maybe the horseshoer beat them up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground or the veterinarian but a person can ride them cattle are the same way man on a horse a man on foot there are two different things you see it's a different picture see I want you to think about just how specific this is now this ability to put information into categories I find a lot of people are not very good at this like when I'm out troubleshooting with equipment or problems with something in a plant they don't seem to be able to figure out do I have a training people issue or do I have something wrong with the equipment in other words categorizing equipment problem from a people problem I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that now let's say I figure out is an equipment problem is it a minor problem with something simple I can fix or is a whole design of the system wrong people have a hard time figuring that out let's just look at something like you know solving problems with y'all making airlines safer yeah I'm a million-mile flyer I do lots and lots of flying and then you know like if I was at the FFA what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of it would be their airplane tails you know five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years tail either came off or coasteering stuff inside the tail broke in some way its tails pure and simple and when the pilots walk around the plane guess what they can't see that stuff inside the tail you know now as I think about that I'm pulling up all of that you know specific information it's specific see my thinking's bottom up I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle now here's a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats you've been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat white cowboy hats that was absolutely fine now the thing is the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together we've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds and one of the things that's driving me really crazy so I travel around than I do autism meetings is I'm seeing a lot of smart geeky nerdy kids and they just aren't very social and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science this brings up the whole thing on my science teacher my science teacher has shown absolutely beautifully in the movie as a goof ball student when I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying until I had on mr. carlock's science class he was now dr. Carlock in the movie and he he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room this brings up the whole thing he got to show kids interesting stuff you know one of the things that I think maybe Ted ought to do is done tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on Ted there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids and the teachers out in the Midwest and other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas they don't know they do with these kids and they're not going down the right path the thing is you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind or a mind can be wired to be more social and what some of the research now is showing autism is there may be extra wiring back here and then really brilliant mine and we lose a few social circuits here it's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social and then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be nonverbal in the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals this is the work of dr. Bruce Miller and he studied alzheimerís patients they had frontal temporal lobe dementia and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain and then this artwork came out of somebody that used to install stereos and cars now van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this Eddy pattern and his painting followed a statistical model of turbulence this brings up a whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head and the Wolfram stuff I was taking notes I was write down all the all the search words I could use because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures we've got a show these kids to interesting stuff and they've taken out the auto shop class and the drafting class in the art class I mean art was my best subject in school we've got to think about all these different kinds of minds and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future and let's talk about jobs okay my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball it didn't want to study but you know what I was getting work experience I'm seeing too many these smart kids that haven't learned basic things like how to be on time I was taught that when I was eight years old you know how to have table manners at Granny's at Sunday party I was taught that when I was very very young and when I was 13 I had a job at a dressmakers shop by selling clothes I did internships in college I did I was building things and I also had to learn how to do assignments you know all I want to do is draw pictures the horses when I was little mother said well let's do a picture of something else they got to learn how to do something else let's say the kids fixated on leg let's get them working on building different things think about the autistic mind as it tends to be fixated like if the kid loves race cars let's use race cars for math let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance in other words use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that's one of the things we need to do and really get fed up when the you know the teachers when especially when you get away from this part of the country they don't know what to do with these smart kids it just drives me crazy what can visual thinkers do when they grow up they can do graphic design all kinds of stuff with computers photography Industrial Design on the pattern thinkers they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers all of those kinds of jobs and then you've got the word minds they make great journalists and they're also make really really good stage actors because the thing about being autistic is I had to learn social skills like being in a play it just kind of just have to learn it and we need to be working with these students and this brings up mentors you know my science teacher was not an accredited teacher he was a NASA space scientist now some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or degree in chemistry you can come into the school and teach you know biology or chemistry we need to be doing that because what I'm observing is the good teachers for a lot of these kids are out in the community colleges but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools another thing that can be very very very successful is there's a lot of people that may have retired from you know working in the software industry and they can teach a kid and it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark you get nected turned on and you get them turned on then you'll learn all the new stuff mentors are just essential I can't emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me and we've got to mentor them hire them and if you bring them in for internships and your company's the thing about the autism Asperger II kind of mine you got to give a specific task don't just say design new software you're going to tell them something a lot more specific well we're designing a software for phone and it has to do some specific thing and it can only use so much memory that's the kind of specificity you need well that's the end of my talk and I just want to thank everybody for coming it was great to be here oh yeah question for me okay thank you thank you so much for that you know you once wrote I like this quote if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave hey guys who do you think made the first stone spear Jose Asperger guy and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetic said they know more Silicon Valley and the energy crisis would not be solved someone shot you a couple of the questions and you know if any of these feel inappropriate it's okay to say next question but if if there's someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them what advice would you give them well first of all I got a look at age if you have a two three or four year old you know no speech no social interaction I can't emphasize enough don't wait you need to at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching you know thing as autism comes in different degrees there's going about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn the talk and they're not gonna be working in Silicon Valley that would that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do but then you got these smart geeky kids you know the touch of autism and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things I got social interaction through shared interests I rode horses with other kids I made model rockets with other kids did electronics lab you know without the kids and then 60s it was gluing mirrors on the under rubber membrane on speaker to make a light shell that was like we can serve that super cool look is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them as some might most well let me tell you that child will be loyal if the house is burning down they're gonna get you out of it Wow so most people if you ask them what are they most passionate about that say things like my kids or or my lover or what are you most passionate about I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place when I have a mother of an autistic child say my kid went to college because of your book or something or wanting our lectures that makes me happy you know like the slaughter plants I've worked with them in the 80s they were absolutely awful I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many cattle got poked with the Prada how many cattle are moving their heads off and it's very very simple you met you directly observe a few simple things it's worked really well I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world we need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stone what are you talking on the phone one of the things you said that really astonished me was he said one thing you were passionate about was server farms talk about the reason why I got really excited I read about that it's contains knowledge its libraries and to me knowledge is something that is extremely valuable so maybe over 10 years ago now our library got flooded this is before the internet got really big and I was really upset of all the books being wrecked because it was knowledge being destroyed and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge temple can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at Ted well thank you so much thank you

**Transcript**:
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe the child remains nonverbal all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers and I actually feel at home here because it's a lot of autism genetics here you wouldn't have any it's a continuum of traits when does a nerd turn into you know Asperger which is just mild autism I mean Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today and one of the things that really is going to concern me is getting these kids to to be the ones that are going to invent the next two energy things now that Bill Gates talked about this morning okay now if you want to understand autism animals and I want to talk to you about different ways of thinking you have to get away from verbal language I think in pictures I don't think in language now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details okay this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or pick out the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly and the thing is the normal brain ignores the details well if you're building a fridge details are pretty important because I'll fall down if you ignore the details and one of my big concerns is a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract people are getting away from doing hands-on stuff I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes because art and classes like that those are the classes where I accept okay in my work with cattle I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle book like for example is flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility this feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility all they needed to do was move the flag rapid movement contrast in the early 70s when I started I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing people thought that was crazy a code on offense would make em block shadows would make them bark a whole was on the floor people weren't noticing these things a chain hanging down and that's shown very very nicely in the movie in fact I loved the movie how they duplicated all my projects that's the geek side my drawings got the star in the movie too and actually it's called Temple Grandin not thinking in pictures so what is thinking in pictures it's literally movies in your hat my mind works like Google for Images now when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different I thought everybody thought in pictures and then when I did my book thinking in pictures I started interviewing people about how they think you know shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different like if I say think about a church steeple most people get this sort of generalized generic one now maybe that's not true in this room but it's going to be true in a lot of different places I see only specific pictures they flash up into my memory just like Google for pictures and in the movie they've got a great scene in there where the word shoe is said in a whole bunch of 50s and 60s shoes pop into my imagination okay there's my childhood Church that's specific there's some more Fort Collins okay how about famous ones and they just kind of come up kind of like this just really quickly like Google for pictures and they come up one at a time and then I think well okay well maybe we can have it snow or we can have a thunderstorm I can hold it there and turn them into videos now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities and I've worked really hard on improving on how cattle are treated at slaughter plant I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it but one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test

if any of these feel inappropriate it's okay to say next question but if if there's someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them what advice would you give them well first of all I got a look at age if you have a two three or four year old you know no speech no social interaction I can't emphasize enough don't wait you need to at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching you know thing as autism comes in different degrees there's going about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn the talk and they're not gonna be working in Silicon Valley that would that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do but then you got these smart geeky kids you know the touch of autism and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things I got social interaction through shared interests I rode horses with other kids I made model rockets with other kids did electronics lab you know without the kids and then 60s it was gluing mirrors on the under rubber membrane on speaker to make a light shell that was like we can serve that super cool look is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them as some might most well let me tell you that child will be loyal if the house is burning down they're gonna get you out of it Wow so most people if you ask them what are they most passionate about that say things like my kids or or my lover or what are you most passionate about I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place when I have a mother of an autistic child say my kid went to college because of your book or something or wanting our lectures that makes me happy you know like the slaughter plants I've worked with them in the 80s they were absolutely awful I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many cattle got poked with the Prada how many cattle are moving their heads off and it's very very simple you met you directly observe a few simple things it's worked really well I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world we need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stone what are you talking on the phone one of the things you said that really astonished me was he said one thing you were passionate about was server farms talk about the reason why I got really excited I read about that it's contains knowledge its libraries and to me knowledge is something that is extremely valuable so maybe over 10 years ago now our library got flooded this is before the internet got really big and I was really upset of all the books being wrecked because it was knowledge being destroyed and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge temple can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at Ted well thank you so much thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] let's pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool Teddy Sh'ma sheen and it's a time machine and everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and I wonder what you'd choose because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back I don't know they want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or American Idol I don't know I'm unconvinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and I understand that I'm not part of that crowd I have to say I don't want to go back and it's not because I'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so I want to get in the machine and I want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great-grandparents died all of them by the time they were 60 my grandparents push that number to 70 my parents are closing in on 80 so I there better be it there better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did a hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has it's gone it's vanished we vanquished it poof in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly diphtheria rubella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the News because there are some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all their accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's disgraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rain forests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away too so the question is can we do that and I I think we can I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it I really do believe that and know it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we battled Progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know what you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago I wrote a story about vaccines from The New Yorker a little story and I was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history I know what to do so I just did what I do I wrote a story and I moved on and soon after that I wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so I wrote a story about that too and I couldn't understand why people thought this was frankenfoods why they thought molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know I do what I do I wrote the story I moved on I mean I'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and I couldn't figure out why and eventually I did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it it just disturbed me so much but then I thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress okay there are reasons for that and I think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there there's no reason we shouldn't have you can just say a few names and people will understand Chernobyl Bhopal the Challenger Vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads I mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that I've never seen and hope never to see again about 12 years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles months in rubella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's Anna serious issue the data came back the data came back from the United States from England from Sweden from Canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe does we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and I do understand that I think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here's a fact the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible and what kind of what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now I understand it I do understand it because anyone have measles here does one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles doesn't happen very much doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King lives and they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero Jonas Salk he took one of the worst scourge of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio poof gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is Paul Offit he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people it'll save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right well it's good except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the whining and he actually says it that way so Paul's a terrorist when Paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school and why because Paul made a vaccine I don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have measles in this country now and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of measles what about polio let's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought it was a little strident no one's ever said that before she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today I don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning and he's flying to LAX right now he's over Ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours are going to rent a car and he's going to come to Long Beach and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with the paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning echinacea a little echinacea a little antioxidant to get you going I know you did because half of Americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that it's okay you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for a dark urine I'm totally with you dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well I think I understand we hate Big Pharma we hate big government we don't trust the man and we shouldn't our health care system sucks it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishing cold and soul deadening to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo that's fantastic I love big  bar but you know it's not it's it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and I have all sorts of little props here none of it ginko fraud Echinacea fraud akai I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it it's fraud and you know what when I say this stuff people scream at me and they say what do you care let people do what they want to do it's it's it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because I don't care if it's the Secretary of HHS who's saying hmm I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on my mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas when you start down the road where belief in magic replace evidence in science you end up in a place you don't want to be you end up in Tabo and Becky South Africa he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's a debate about words about metaphors its ideology it's not science every single thing we we grain of rice every sprig of parsley every brussel sprout has been modified by man you know there weren't tangerines in the Garden of Eden there wasn't any cantaloupe there weren't Christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years and some of it worked and some of it didn't we got rid of the stuff that didn't now we can do it in a more precise way and their risks absolutely but we can put something like vitamin A into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their lives you don't want to do that I have to say I don't understand it we object to genetically engineered food why do we do that well the things I constantly hear are too many chemicals pesticides hormones monoculture we don't want giant fields of the same thing that's wrong we don't want companies patenting life we don't want companies owning seeds and you know what my response to all of that is yes you're right let's fix it it's true we've got a huge food problem that this isn't science this has nothing to do with science its law its morality its patent stuff you know science isn't a company it's not a country it's not even an idea it's a process it's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid is really very deadening and it's preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70% more food than we do right now 70% this is investment in Africa over the last 30 years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we're not giving it to them and why genetically engineered food we don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance because I was something that half a billion people eat it's kind of like a potato it's just a bunch of calories it sucks it doesn't have nutrients it doesn't have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now and then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not they wouldn't starve and you know what that would be nice wouldn't be Chez Panisse but it would be nice and all I can say about this is why are we fighting it why I mean let's ask her such why are we fighting it because we don't want to move genes around this is about moving genes around it's not about chemicals it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food this isn't about rice crispies this is about keeping people alive and it's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don't if we continue to act the way we're actually we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of high-tech colonialism there's no other way to describe what's going on here it's selfish it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it so after this amazingly fun conversation you might want to say so you still want to go in this ridiculous time machine and go for it and absolutely absolutely I do it's stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it and we're going to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead we're going to be happy we do I know that we can and as far as I'm concerned that's something the world needs right now thank you you

today I don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning and he's flying to LAX right now he's over Ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours are going to rent a car and he's going to come to Long Beach and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with the paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning echinacea a little echinacea a little antioxidant to get you going I know you did because half of Americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that it's okay you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for a dark urine I'm totally with you dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well I think I understand we hate Big Pharma we hate big government we don't trust the man and we shouldn't our health care system sucks it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishing cold and soul deadening to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo that's fantastic I love big  bar but you know it's not it's it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and I have all sorts of little props here none of it ginko fraud Echinacea fraud akai I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it it's fraud and you know what when I say this stuff people scream at me and they say what do you care let people do what they want to do it's it's it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because I don't care if it's the Secretary of HHS who's saying hmm I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on my mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas when you start down the road where belief in magic replace evidence in science you end up in a place you don't want to be you end up in Tabo and Becky South Africa he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's a debate about words about metaphors its ideology it's not science every single thing we we grain of rice every sprig of parsley every brussel sprout has been modified by man you know there weren't tangerines in the Garden of Eden there wasn't any cantaloupe there weren't Christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years and some of it worked and some of it didn't we got rid of the stuff that didn't now we can do it in a more precise way and their risks absolutely but we can put something like vitamin A into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their lives you don't want to do that I have to say I don't understand it we object to genetically engineered food why do we do that well the things I constantly hear are too many chemicals pesticides hormones monoculture we don't want giant fields of the same thing that's wrong we don't want companies patenting life we don't want companies owning seeds and you know what my response to all of that is yes you're right let's fix it it's true we've got a huge food problem that this isn't science this has nothing to do with science its law its morality its patent stuff you know science isn't a company it's not a country it's not even an idea it's a process it's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid is really very deadening and it's preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70% more food than we do right now 70% this is investment in Africa over the last 30 years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we're not giving it to them and why genetically engineered food we don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance because I was something that half a billion people eat it's kind of like a potato it's just a bunch of calories it sucks it doesn't have nutrients it doesn't have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now and then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not they wouldn't starve and you know what that would be nice wouldn't be Chez Panisse but it would be nice and all I can say about this is why are we fighting it why I mean let's ask her such why are we fighting it because we don't want to move genes around this is about moving genes around it's not about chemicals it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food this isn't about rice crispies this is about keeping people alive and it's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don't if we continue to act the way we're actually we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of high-tech colonialism there's no other way to describe what's going on here it's selfish it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it so after this amazingly fun conversation you might want to say so you still want to go in this ridiculous time machine and go for it and absolutely absolutely I do it's stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it and we're going to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead we're going to be happy we do I know that we can and as far as I'm concerned that's something the world needs right now thank you you

[Music] let's pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool Teddy Sh'ma sheen and it's a time machine and everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and I wonder what you'd choose because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back I don't know they want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or American Idol I don't know I'm unconvinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and I understand that I'm not part of that crowd I have to say I don't want to go back and it's not because I'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so I want to get in the machine and I want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great-grandparents died all of them by the time they were 60 my grandparents push that number to 70 my parents are closing in on 80 so I there better be it there better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did a hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has it's gone it's vanished we vanquished it poof in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly diphtheria rubella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the News because there are some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all their accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's disgraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rain forests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away too so the question is can we do that and I I think we can I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it I really do believe that and know it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we battled Progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know what you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago I wrote a story about vaccines from The New Yorker a little story and I was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history I know what to do so I just did what I do I wrote a story and I moved on and soon after that I wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so I wrote a story about that too and I couldn't understand why people thought this was frankenfoods why they thought molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know I do what I do I wrote the story I moved on I mean I'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and I couldn't figure out why and eventually I did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it it just disturbed me so much but then I thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress okay there are reasons for that and I think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there there's no reason we shouldn't have you can just say a few names and people will understand Chernobyl Bhopal the Challenger Vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads I mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that I've never seen and hope never to see again about 12 years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles months in rubella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's Anna serious issue the data came back the data came back from the United States from England from Sweden from Canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe does we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and I do understand that I think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here's a fact the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible and what kind of what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now I understand it I do understand it because anyone have measles here does one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles doesn't happen very much doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King lives and they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero Jonas Salk he took one of the worst scourge of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio poof gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is Paul Offit he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people it'll save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right well it's good except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the whining and he actually says it that way so Paul's a terrorist when Paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school and why because Paul made a vaccine I don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have measles in this country now and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of measles what about polio let's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought it was a little strident no one's ever said that before she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today I don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning and he's flying to LAX right now he's over Ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours are going to rent a car and he's going to come to Long Beach and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with the paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning echinacea a little echinacea a little antioxidant to get you going I know you did because half of Americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that it's okay you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for a dark urine I'm totally with you dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well I think I understand we hate Big Pharma we hate big government we don't trust the man and we shouldn't our health care system sucks it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishing cold and soul deadening to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo that's fantastic I love big  bar but you know it's not it's it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and I have all sorts of little props here none of it ginko fraud Echinacea fraud akai I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it it's fraud and you know what when I say this stuff people scream at me and they say what do you care let people do what they want to do it's it's it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because I don't care if it's the Secretary of HHS who's saying hmm I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on my mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas when you start down the road where belief in magic replace evidence in science you end up in a place you don't want to be you end up in Tabo and Becky South Africa he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the

no consequences to these things there are there always are now the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's a debate about words about metaphors its ideology it's not science every single thing we we grain of rice every sprig of parsley every

dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and I couldn't figure out why and eventually I did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it it just disturbed me so much but then I thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress okay there are reasons for that and I think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there there's no reason we shouldn't have you can just say a few names and people will understand Chernobyl Bhopal the Challenger Vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads I mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that I've never seen and hope never to see again about 12 years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles months in rubella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it's Anna serious issue the data came back the data came back from the United States from England from Sweden from Canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe does we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and I do understand that I think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here's a fact the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it's horrible and what kind of what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now I understand it I do understand it because anyone have measles here does one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles doesn't happen very much doesn't happen in this country at all but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King lives and they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero Jonas Salk he took one of the worst scourge of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio poof gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is Paul Offit he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people it'll save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right well it's good except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and the people ought to just stop the whining and he actually says it that way so Paul's a terrorist when Paul speaks in a public hearing he can't testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school and why because Paul made a vaccine I don't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that's happening we have measles in this country now and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game and they're not just going to die of measles what about polio let's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought it was a little strident no one's ever said that before she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don't have polio and you know what we didn't have polio in this country yesterday today I don't know maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning and he's flying to LAX right now he's over Ohio and he's going to land in a couple hours are going to rent a car and he's going to come to Long Beach and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight and he doesn't know that he's infected with the paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works that's the planet we live on don't pretend it isn't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning echinacea a little echinacea a little antioxidant to get you going I know you did because half of Americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that it's okay you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for a dark urine I'm totally with you dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well I think I understand we hate Big Pharma we hate big government we don't trust the man and we shouldn't our health care system sucks it's cruel to millions of people it's absolutely astonishing cold and soul deadening to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo that's fantastic I love big  bar but you know it's not it's it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and I have all sorts of little props here none of it ginko fraud Echinacea fraud akai I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it it's fraud and you know what when I say this stuff people scream at me and they say what do you care let people do what they want to do it's it's it makes them feel good and you know what you're wrong because I don't care if it's the Secretary of HHS who's saying hmm I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on my mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas when you start down the road where belief in magic replace evidence in science you end up in a place you don't want to be you end up in Tabo and Becky South Africa he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite it's an idiotic debate it has to stop it's a debate about words about metaphors its ideology it's not science every single thing we we grain of rice every sprig of parsley every brussel sprout has been modified by man you know there weren't tangerines in the Garden of Eden there wasn't any cantaloupe there weren't Christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years and some of it worked and some of it didn't we got rid of the stuff that didn't now we can do it in a more precise way and their risks absolutely but we can put something like vitamin A into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their lives you don't want to do that I have to say I don't understand it we object to genetically engineered food why do we do that well the things I constantly hear are too many chemicals pesticides hormones monoculture we don't want giant fields of the same thing that's wrong we don't want companies patenting life we don't want companies owning seeds and you know what my response to all of that is yes you're right let's fix it it's true we've got a huge food problem that this isn't science this has nothing to do with science its law its morality its patent stuff you know science isn't a company it's not a country it's not even an idea it's a process it's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid is really very deadening and it's preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70% more food than we do right now 70% this is investment in Africa over the last 30 years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we're not giving it to them and why genetically engineered food we don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance because I was something that half a billion people eat it's kind of like a potato it's just a bunch of calories it sucks it doesn't have nutrients it doesn't have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now and then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not they wouldn't starve and you know what that would be nice wouldn't be Chez Panisse but it would be nice and all I can say about this is why are we fighting it why I mean let's ask her such why are we fighting it because we don't want to move genes around this is about moving genes around it's not about chemicals it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food this isn't about rice crispies this is about keeping people alive and it's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don't if we continue to act the way we're actually we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of high-tech colonialism there's no other way to describe what's going on here it's selfish it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it so after this amazingly fun conversation you might want to say so you still want to go in this ridiculous time machine and go for it and absolutely absolutely I do it's stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it and we're going to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead we're going to be happy we do I know that we can and as far as I'm concerned that's something the world needs right now thank you you

[Music] let's pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool Teddy Sh'ma sheen and it's a time machine and everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and I wonder what you'd choose because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back I don't know they want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or American Idol I don't know I'm unconvinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and I understand that I'm not part of that crowd I have to say I don't want to go back and it's not because I'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward so I want to get in the machine and I want to go forward this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there's never been a time like this my great-grandparents died all of them by the time they were 60 my grandparents push that number to 70 my parents are closing in on 80 so I there better be it there better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it's not even about people like us because this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did a hundred years ago think about that it's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has it's gone it's vanished we vanquished it poof in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exists hardly diphtheria rubella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that's the good news unfortunately that's all the News because there are some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all their accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number is rising and it's rising really rapidly and it's disgraceful and not only that we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rain forests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away too so the question is can we do that and I I think we can I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it I really do believe that and know it ain't wishful thinking but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we battled Progress when we thought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion they're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know what you're not entitled to you're not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not and this took me a while to figure out about a decade ago I wrote a story about vaccines from The New Yorker a little story and I was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history I know what to do so I just did what I do I wrote a story and I moved on and soon after that I wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so I wrote a story about that too and I couldn't understand why people thought this was frankenfoods why they thought molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on nature's ground but you know I do what I do I wrote the story I moved on I mean I'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it's fun but these stories bothered me and I couldn't figure out why and eventually I did and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it it just disturbed me so much but then I thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress okay there are reasons for that and I think we know what those reasons are we've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there there's no reason we shouldn't have you can just say a few names and people will understand Chernobyl Bhopal the Challenger Vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads I mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe we're always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don't take anything for granted but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that and the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that I've never seen and hope never to see again about 12 years

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] now I wanted to start with the question when was the last time you were called childish for kids like me being called childish can be a frequent occurrence every time we make irrational demands exhibit irresponsible behavior or display any other signs of being normal American citizens we are called childish which really bothers me after all take a look at these events imperialism and colonization world wars george w bush ask yourself who's responsible adults now what have kids done bull and Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust ruby bridges helped to end segregation in the United States and most recently Charlie Simpson helped to raise one hundred and twenty thousand pounds for Haiti on his little bike so as you can see evidence by such examples age has absolutely nothing to do with it the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking thank you then again who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs maybe you've had grand plans before but stopped yourself thinking the that's impossible or that costs too much or that won't benefit me for better or worse sweet kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thing about reasons why not to do things kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were free kind of utopia how many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals can be a burden because you know that if everything were free then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and leaped chaos on the other hand we kids still dream about perfection and that's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality you have to dream about it first in many ways our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the Museum of Glass in Tacoma Washington my home state yoo-hoo Washington has a program called kids design glass and kids draw their own ideas for glass art now the resident artist said that they got some of their best ideas from the program because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass and the certain shapes they just think of good ideas now when you think of glass you might think of colorful shmuly designs or maybe Italian vases but kids challenge glass ours to go beyond that into the realm of broken-hearted snakes and bacon boys who you can see as meat vision now our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insiders knowledge kids already do a lot of learning from adults and we have a lot to share I think that adults should start learning from kids now I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd teachers and students and I like this analogy it shouldn't just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students to do this do that the students should teach their teachers learning between grownups and kids should be reciprocal the reality unfortunately is a little different and it has a lot to do with trust or a lack of it now if you don't trust someone you place restrictions on them right if I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the 10% interest she established on her last loan I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back true story by the way now adults seem to have adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every don't do that don't do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use as history points out regimes become pressive when they're fearful about keeping control and although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes kids have no or very little saying making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population now it's kind of worse and restriction is the adults often underestimate kids abilities we love challenges but when expectations are low trust me we will sing to them my own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister okay so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ fighters when lots of other kids were hearing the wheels on the bus go round and round well we heard that one too but pioneer germ Fighters totally rules I love to write from the age of four and when I was six my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word thank you Bill Gates and thank you mom I wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop and I wanted to get published instead of just scoffing at this heresy that kid when to get published or saying wait until you're older my parents were really supportive many publishers were not quite so encouraging one large children's publisher ironically saying they didn't work with children might want to children's publisher not work with children I don't know you kind of alienating large there now one publisher action publishing was willing to take that leap and trust me and to listen to what I had to say they published my first book flying fingers you see it here and from there on it's gone speaking at hundreds of schools keynote and the thousands of educators and finally today speaking to you I appreciate your attention today because to show that you truly care you listen but there's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults kids grow up and become adults just like you or just like you really the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult but rather better adults than you have been which may be a little challenge and consider your guys credentials but the way progress happens is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones it's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore no matter your position or place in life it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away adults and fellow tedsters you need to listen and learn from kids and trust us and expect more from us you must lend an ear today because we are the leaders of tomorrow which means we're gonna be taking care of you and your old and son Isle no just kidding actually um no really we are going to be the next generation the one who will bring this world forward and in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you remember that cloning is possible and that involves going to childhood again in which case you'll want to be heard just like my generation now the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas kids need opportunities to lead and succeed are you ready to make the match because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom thank you you

I had to say they published my first book flying fingers you see it here and from there on it's gone speaking at hundreds of schools keynote and the thousands of educators and finally today speaking to you I appreciate your attention today because to show that you truly care you listen but there's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults kids grow up and become adults just like you or just like you really the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult but rather better adults than you have been which may be a little challenge and consider your guys credentials but the way progress happens is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones it's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore no matter your position or place in life it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away adults and fellow tedsters you need to listen and learn from kids and trust us and expect more from us you must lend an ear today because we are the leaders of tomorrow which means we're gonna be taking care of you and your old and son Isle no just kidding actually um no really we are going to be the next generation the one who will bring this world forward and in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you remember that cloning is possible and that involves going to childhood again in which case you'll want to be heard just like my generation now the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas kids need opportunities to lead and succeed are you ready to make the match because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom thank you you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] now I wanted to start with the question when was the last time you were called childish for kids like me being called childish can be a frequent occurrence every time we make irrational demands exhibit irresponsible behavior or display any other signs of being normal American citizens we are called childish which really bothers me after all take a look at these events imperialism and colonization world wars george w bush ask yourself who's responsible adults now what have kids done bull and Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust ruby bridges helped to end segregation in the United States and most recently Charlie Simpson helped to raise one hundred and twenty thousand pounds for Haiti on his little bike so as you can see evidence by such examples age has absolutely nothing to do with it the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking thank you then again who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs maybe you've had grand plans before but stopped yourself thinking the that's impossible or that costs too much or that won't benefit me for better or worse sweet kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thing about reasons why not to do things kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were free kind of utopia how many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals can be a burden because you know that if everything were free then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and leaped chaos on the other hand we kids still dream about perfection and that's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality you have to dream about it first in many ways our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the Museum of Glass in Tacoma Washington my home state yoo-hoo Washington has a program called kids design glass and kids draw their own ideas for glass art now the resident artist said that they got some of their best ideas from the program because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass and the certain shapes they just think of good ideas now when you think of glass you might think of colorful shmuly designs or maybe Italian vases but kids challenge glass ours to go beyond that into the realm of broken-hearted snakes and bacon boys who you can see as meat vision now our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insiders knowledge kids already do a lot of learning from adults and we have a lot to share I think that adults should start learning from kids now I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd teachers and students and I like this analogy it shouldn't just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students to do this do that the students should teach their teachers learning between grownups and kids should be reciprocal the reality unfortunately is a little different and it has a lot to do with trust or a lack of it now if you don't trust someone you place restrictions on them right if I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the 10% interest she established on her last loan I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back true story by the way now adults seem to have adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every don't do that don't do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use as history points out regimes become pressive when they're fearful about keeping control and although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes kids have no or very little saying making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population now it's kind of worse and restriction is the adults often underestimate kids abilities we love challenges but when expectations are low trust me we will sing to them my own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister okay so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ fighters when lots of other kids were hearing the wheels on the bus go round and round well we heard that one too but pioneer germ Fighters totally rules I love to write from the age of four and when I was six my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word thank you Bill Gates and thank you mom I wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop and I wanted to get published instead of just scoffing at this heresy that kid when to get published or saying wait until you're older my parents were really supportive many publishers were not quite so encouraging one large children's publisher ironically saying they didn't work with children might
