To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever talked with a friend
about a problem only to realize that he just doesn't seem to grasp
why the issue is so important to you? Have you ever presented an idea to
a group and it's met with utter confusion? Or maybe you've been in an argument when the other person suddenly accuses you of not listening 
to what they're saying at all? What's going on here? The answer is miscommunication, and in some form or another, we've all experienced it. It can lead to confusion, animosity, misunderstanding, or even crashing a multimillion
dollar probe into the surface of Mars. The fact is even when face-to-face
with another person, in the very same room, and speaking the same language, human communication is incredibly complex. But the good news is 
that a basic understanding of what happens when we communicate can help us prevent miscommunication. For decades, researchers have asked,
"What happens when we communicate?" One interpretation,
called the transmission model, views communication as a message that
moves directly from one person to another, similar to someone tossing a ball
and walking away. But in reality, this simplistic model doesn't account
for communication's complexity. Enter the transactional model, which acknowledges the many 
added challenges of communicating. With this model, it's more accurate
to think of communication between people as a game of catch. As we communicate our message,
we receive feedback from the other party. Through the transaction,
we create meaning together. But from this exchange,
further complications arise. It's not like the Star Trek universe, where some characters 
can Vulcan mind meld, fully sharing thoughts and feelings. As humans, we can't help but send
and receive messages through our own subjective lenses. When communicating, one person expresses
her interpretation of a message, and the person she's communicating with hears his own interpretation 
of that message. Our perceptual filters continually shift
meanings and interpretations. Remember that game of catch? Imagine it with a lump of clay. As each person touches it, they shape it to fit 
their own unique perceptions based on any number of variables, like knowledge or past experience, 
age, race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or family background. Simultaneously, every person interprets
the message they receive based on their relationship 
with the other person, and their unique understanding of the semantics and connotations 
of the exact words being used. They could also be distracted
by other stimuli, such as traffic or a growling stomach. Even emotion might cloud 
their understanding, and by adding more people
into a conversation, each with their own subjectivities, the complexity of communication
grows exponentially. So as the lump of clay goes back and forth
from one person to another, reworked, reshaped, and always changing, it's no wonder our messages sometimes
turn into a mush of miscommunication. But, luckily, there are some 
simple practices that can help us all navigate our daily
interactions for better communication. One: recognize that passive hearing
and active listening are not the same. Engage actively with the verbal
and nonverbal feedback of others, and adjust your message to facilitate
greater understanding. Two: listen with your eyes and ears,
as well as with your gut. Remember that communication 
is more than just words. Three: take time to understand as you try
to be understood. In the rush to express ourselves, it's easy to forget that communication
is a two-way street. Be open to what 
the other person might say. And finally, four: Be aware of your personal 
perceptual filters. Elements of your experience, including your culture, 
community, and family, influence how you see the world. Say, "This is how I see the problem,
but how do you see it?" Don't assume that your perception
is the objective truth. That'll help you work toward sharing
a dialogue with others to reach a common understanding together.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the content of the transcript and the generated MCQs, I can infer that the closest match would be related to the distinction between "hearing" and "listening" or the importance of active listening.

The closest match is Question 7, which mentions "passive hearing and active listening" as options. However, it does not directly ask which activity is more intentional.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match.

from one person to another, reworked, reshaped, and always changing, it's no wonder our messages sometimes
turn into a mush of miscommunication. But, luckily, there are some 
simple practices that can help us all navigate our daily
interactions for better communication. One: recognize that passive hearing
and active listening are not the same. Engage actively with the verbal
and nonverbal feedback of others, and adjust your message to facilitate
greater understanding. Two: listen with your eyes and ears,
as well as with your gut. Remember that communication 
is more than just words. Three: take time to understand as you try
to be understood. In the rush to express ourselves, it's easy to forget that communication
is a two-way street. Be open to what 
the other person might say. And finally, four: Be aware of your personal 
perceptual filters. Elements of your experience, including your culture, 
community, and family, influence how you see the world. Say, "This is how I see the problem,
but how do you see it?" Don't assume that your perception
is the objective truth. That'll help you work toward sharing
a dialogue with others to reach a common understanding together.

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1589,
the town of Bedburg, Germany, held a highly publicized trial. Peter Stubbe was accused
of several gruesome crimes, including murder, assault,
and cannibalism. But perhaps the most sinister accusation
of them all, was of being a werewolf. In his confession, Peter claimed that
the devil had given him a magic girdle, which allowed him to transform into a wolf
and perform his horrific acts. Stories of werewolves existed well before
this trial and continue to live on today. They’re especially prominent
in European literature and folklore, and often found in cultures where the wolf
is the largest natural predator. Over the years, the image of the werewolf
has continuously evolved, often reflecting the fears and prejudices
of that time. In early literature, werewolves were
sometimes painted as sympathetic figures: victims of curses who longed to return
to their human form. In the story of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest written accounts of
werewolves from over 4.000 years ago, a shepherd falls in love
with the goddess of love, Ishtar, who transforms him into a wolf
when she grows tired of his affection. In this and several other
stories that followed, werewolves were often men who had fallen
prey to deceitful, alluring women. In the medieval story of “Bisclavret,” a knight is trapped in wolf form
by the cunning of his wife, who leaves him to elope with another man. Other early stories explored fears
about the darker side of human nature, including taboos such as
cannibalism and murder. In ancient Greek mythology, King Lycaon was transformed
into a wolf by Zeus, after he attempted to trick the god
into eating human flesh. As Catholicism spread throughout Europe, werewolves became increasingly linked
to magic, sorcery, and pagan belief. By the 16th century, many people struggled
separating werewolf fiction from fact. Political, economic,
and religious upheavals gave rise to the infamous
European witch trials. And while witches were the main
targets, in some areas, alleged werewolves like Peter Stubbe
were also tried and executed. Today, some historians view the trials
as driven by a fear of outsiders, as well as society's early attempts
to understand brutal crimes. While public belief in werewolves
died down by the 17th century as medicine and psychology advanced, the myth would re-emerge in literature. By the Victorian period,
werewolves had transformed again, often embodying fears of moral
and psychological decay. In George Reynolds’s
“Wagner the Wehrwolf,” the protagonist makes a pact with the
devil to achieve eternal youth. But in return, he transforms
into a violent howling wolf at the end of every month. By the mid-20th century, werewolves found a new home to haunt—
the silver screen. Here, the werewolf began to take
its modern form. For example, the idea that the curse
could be transmitted through bites and triggered by a full moon was first popularized with the
1935 film “Werewolf of London.” Produced in the United States, the film identifies the werewolf infection
as originating from the east— specifically Tibet. This mirrored xenophobic fears
of the time— that East Asian immigrants
into North America and Europe threatened the stability and power
of the west. Werewolf hunters adopted silver
as their weapon of choice after its use in 1941′s “The Wolf Man.” Written by Jewish writer Curt Siodmak, the film is viewed by many scholars
as an allegory for Nazi brutality. In the film, a pentagram appears on the
palm of the werewolf’s next victim, which is thought to allude to the
compulsory Star of David badges found in Europe during the 1930 and 40s. Since the 1950s, cinematic werewolves have
frequently infected a new group of victims: the teenager. Here, werewolves are often symbols
of male aggression and the uncertainty of adolescence. By the end of the century, some films began to use
the beastly transformation to explore themes of puberty, occasionally with a distinctly
feminist perspective. Yet, like all great monsters,
the werewolf lives on, and will continue changing to fit
its future audience’s needs. But, for the time being, it may
be best to stock up on silver, keep to the road, and beware the moon.

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1589,
the town of Bedburg, Germany, held a highly publicized trial. Peter Stubbe was accused
of several gruesome crimes, including murder, assault,
and cannibalism. But perhaps the most sinister accusation
of them all, was of being a werewolf. In his confession, Peter claimed that
the devil had given him a magic girdle, which allowed him to transform into a wolf
and perform his horrific acts. Stories of werewolves existed well before
this trial and continue to live on today. They’re especially prominent
in European literature and folklore, and often found in cultures where the wolf
is the largest natural predator. Over the years, the image of the werewolf
has continuously evolved, often reflecting the fears and prejudices
of that time. In early literature, werewolves were
sometimes painted as sympathetic figures: victims of curses who longed to return
to their human form. In the story of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest written accounts of
werewolves from over 4.000 years ago, a shepherd falls in love
with the goddess of love, Ishtar, who transforms him into a wolf
when she grows tired of his affection. In this and several other
stories that followed, werewolves were often men who had fallen
prey to deceitful, alluring women. In the medieval story of “Bisclavret,” a knight is trapped in wolf form
by the cunning of his wife, who leaves him to elope with another man. Other early stories explored fears
about the darker side of human nature, including taboos such as
cannibalism and murder. In ancient Greek mythology, King Lycaon was transformed
into a wolf by Zeus, after he attempted to trick the god
into eating human flesh. As Catholicism spread throughout Europe, werewolves became increasingly linked
to magic, sorcery, and pagan belief. By the 16th century, many people struggled
separating werewolf fiction from fact. Political, economic,
and religious upheavals gave rise to the infamous
European witch trials. And while witches were the main
targets, in some areas, alleged werewolves like Peter Stubbe
were also tried and executed. Today, some historians view the trials
as driven by a fear of outsiders, as well as society's early attempts
to understand brutal crimes. While public belief in werewolves
died down by the 17th century as medicine and psychology advanced, the myth would re-emerge in literature. By the Victorian period,
werewolves had transformed again, often embodying fears of moral
and psychological decay. In George Reynolds’s
“Wagner the Wehrwolf,” the protagonist makes a pact with the
devil to achieve eternal youth. But in return, he transforms
into a violent howling wolf at the end of every month. By the mid-20th century, werewolves found a new home to haunt—
the silver screen. Here, the werewolf began to take
its modern form. For example, the idea that the curse
could be transmitted through bites and triggered by a full moon was first popularized with the
1935 film “Werewolf of London.” Produced in the United States, the film identifies the werewolf infection
as originating from the east— specifically Tibet. This mirrored xenophobic fears
of the time— that East Asian immigrants
into North America and Europe threatened the stability and power
of the west. Werewolf hunters adopted silver
as their weapon of choice after its use in 1941′s “The Wolf Man.” Written by Jewish writer Curt Siodmak, the film is viewed by many scholars
as an allegory for Nazi brutality. In the film, a pentagram appears on the
palm of the werewolf’s next victim, which is thought to allude to the
compulsory Star of David badges found in Europe during the 1930 and 40s. Since the 1950s, cinematic werewolves have
frequently infected a new group of victims: the teenager. Here, werewolves are often symbols
of male aggression and the uncertainty of adolescence. By the end of the century, some films began to use
the beastly transformation to explore themes of puberty, occasionally with a distinctly
feminist perspective. Yet, like all great monsters,
the werewolf lives on, and will continue changing to fit
its future audience’s needs. But, for the time being, it may
be best to stock up on silver, keep to the road, and beware the moon.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the specific topic of George Reynolds's "Wagner the Wehr-Wolf" and the transformation of the novel's main protagonist into a werewolf.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of werewolf transformation, I would suggest Question 5, which discusses the transformation of a person into a werewolf in a different context (the 1935 film "Werewolf of London"). However, please note that this is a very loose connection and not a direct match.

Therefore, I would not recommend any of the generated MCQs as a direct match for the ground truth MCQ. A new generated MCQ that specifically addresses the topic of George Reynolds's "Wagner the Wehr-Wolf" and the transformation of the novel's main protagonist into a werewolf would be needed to provide a accurate match.

**Transcript**:
You’re halfway through what’s supposedly one of the greatest
novels of the 20th century, but nothing quite makes sense. Narrating characters offer clashing
versions of the same story and often seem unsure who, what,
or when they’re talking about. Seemingly minor details trigger intense
emotional reactions you don't understand. And the prose is loaded with convoluted
sentences and outlandish imagery. Confused? Good— that means
you’re on the right track. William Faulkner is considered
one of America’s most remarkable and perplexing writers. Fortunately, he wasn’t just
toying with his audience. Faulkner used confusion intentionally, to explore the most mysterious parts
of the human mind and investigate pressing issues of
personal, racial, and regional identity. The result is a body of work that’s
shocking, inventive, and often hilarious— but above all, challenging. So what clues should readers look
for to navigate his literary labyrinths? Many of Faulkner’s novels are set
in the fictional county of Yoknapatawpha— a fantastical reimagining 
of Lafayette County, Mississippi, where he spent most of his life. Born in 1897, Faulkner grew up steeped
in oral storytelling traditions, from folklore and family histories
to local legends of Civil War glory. However, these grand myths didn’t match
the messy reality of the American South, divided by racist Jim Crow laws and plagued by the legacies of slavery
and colonial violence. All these tensions come alive 
inside Yoknapatawpha. Full of horror, humor, and human tragedy, Faulkner’s stories feature 
many memorable characters, like the spurned bride who sleeps
beside her would-be husband’s corpse, or the duped sharecropper obsessively
hunting for imaginary coins. At first glance, these characters
seem grotesquely absurd. But under the surface, 
they all reflect his obsession with how people process the past— what they stubbornly hold on to,
unwittingly forget and willingly distort. Much of Faulkner’s fiction is told
from multiple perspectives, offering the reader several versions
of the story’s events. For example, “The Sound and the Fury”
combines the narratives of Benjy, Quentin, and Jason Compson, three brothers haunted by memories
of their sister Caddy. One brother's narration will occasionally
fill the gaps left by another's, but just as often,
their accounts contradict each other. To make things more confusing, 
Benjy’s narration is disjointed in time, slipping between past and present
without warning. Meanwhile, Quentin's section
confuses fact and fantasy as it jumps backward in time
from the day of his untimely death. Only the aggressive, money-hungry Jason
attempts to embrace the present— but even he is constantly overtaken
by past resentments. Following these threads
can be bewildering, but Faulkner wants the audience to share
in the characters’ confusion. This approach allows readers
to understand the Compsons’ biases and blindspots firsthand. And since his characters’ distortions
of the past often reflect larger denials
of Southern history, it also allows Faulkner to explore 
his own anxieties about the South. For example, his novel “Light in August”
deliberately induces ambiguity about a character’s racial origins in ways
that undermine rigid Jim Crow policies. And in “Absalom, Absalom!”
narrating townsfolk remark that “no one knew how” a local landowner had come
into his property, and that his house was built
“apparently out of nothing.” This kind of evasive language shows how
characters are desperate to cover up the region's intolerable history
of genocide and slavery. But even when exploring
the heaviest topics, Faulkner spellbinds readers
with verbal acrobatics. One particularly bewildering sentence
in “Absalom, Absalom!” runs 1,288 words long, and features locals haggling
over “violently-colored candy,” a “cloudy swirl of chickens,”
and a hard-drinking planter who’s compared to both 
a worn-out cannon and a showgirl. Even his jokes can breed more confusion, such as when Benjy Compson conflates
his sister Caddy with golf caddies. Reading Faulkner is rarely easy,
but it is deeply rewarding. He invites readers to contemplate the
unreliable nature of history and memory. And in teaching us to embrace confusion and recognize the limits 
of our perception, Faulkner can help us listen 
for hidden meanings in the sound and fury that surround us.

without warning. Meanwhile, Quentin's section
confuses fact and fantasy as it jumps backward in time
from the day of his untimely death. Only the aggressive, money-hungry Jason
attempts to embrace the present— but even he is constantly overtaken
by past resentments. Following these threads
can be bewildering, but Faulkner wants the audience to share
in the characters’ confusion. This approach allows readers
to understand the Compsons’ biases and blindspots firsthand. And since his characters’ distortions
of the past often reflect larger denials
of Southern history, it also allows Faulkner to explore 
his own anxieties about the South. For example, his novel “Light in August”
deliberately induces ambiguity about a character’s racial origins in ways
that undermine rigid Jim Crow policies. And in “Absalom, Absalom!”
narrating townsfolk remark that “no one knew how” a local landowner had come
into his property, and that his house was built
“apparently out of nothing.” This kind of evasive language shows how
characters are desperate to cover up the region's intolerable history
of genocide and slavery. But even when exploring
the heaviest topics, Faulkner spellbinds readers
with verbal acrobatics. One particularly bewildering sentence
in “Absalom, Absalom!” runs 1,288 words long, and features locals haggling
over “violently-colored candy,” a “cloudy swirl of chickens,”
and a hard-drinking planter who’s compared to both 
a worn-out cannon and a showgirl. Even his jokes can breed more confusion, such as when Benjy Compson conflates
his sister Caddy with golf caddies. Reading Faulkner is rarely easy,
but it is deeply rewarding. He invites readers to contemplate the
unreliable nature of history and memory. And in teaching us to embrace confusion and recognize the limits 
of our perception, Faulkner can help us listen 
for hidden meanings in the sound and fury that surround us.

**Transcript**:
You’re halfway through what’s supposedly one of the greatest
novels of the 20th century, but nothing quite makes sense. Narrating characters offer clashing
versions of the same story and often seem unsure who, what,
or when they’re talking about. Seemingly minor details trigger intense
emotional reactions you don't understand. And the prose is loaded with convoluted
sentences and outlandish imagery. Confused? Good— that means
you’re on the right track. William Faulkner is considered
one of America’s most remarkable and perplexing writers. Fortunately, he wasn’t just
toying with his audience. Faulkner used confusion intentionally, to explore the most mysterious parts
of the human mind and investigate pressing issues of
personal, racial, and regional identity. The result is a body of work that’s
shocking, inventive, and often hilarious— but above all, challenging. So what clues should readers look
for to navigate his literary labyrinths? Many of Faulkner’s novels are set
in the fictional county of Yoknapatawpha— a fantastical reimagining 
of Lafayette County, Mississippi, where he spent most of his life. Born in 1897, Faulkner grew up steeped
in oral storytelling traditions, from folklore and family histories
to local legends of Civil War glory. However, these grand myths didn’t match
the messy reality of the American South, divided by racist Jim Crow laws and plagued by the legacies of slavery
and colonial violence. All these tensions come alive 
inside Yoknapatawpha. Full of horror, humor, and human tragedy, Faulkner’s stories feature 
many memorable characters, like the spurned bride who sleeps
beside her would-be husband’s corpse, or the duped sharecropper obsessively
hunting for imaginary coins. At first glance, these characters
seem grotesquely absurd. But under the surface, 
they all reflect his obsession with how people process the past— what they stubbornly hold on to,
unwittingly forget and willingly distort. Much of Faulkner’s fiction is told
from multiple perspectives, offering the reader several versions
of the story’s events. For example, “The Sound and the Fury”
combines the narratives of Benjy, Quentin, and Jason Compson, three brothers haunted by memories
of their sister Caddy. One brother's narration will occasionally
fill the gaps left by another's, but just as often,
their accounts contradict each other. To make things more confusing, 
Benjy’s narration is disjointed in time, slipping between past and present
without warning. Meanwhile, Quentin's section
confuses fact and fantasy as it jumps backward in time
from the day of his untimely death. Only the aggressive, money-hungry Jason
attempts to embrace the present— but even he is constantly overtaken
by past resentments. Following these threads
can be bewildering, but Faulkner wants the audience to share

**Transcript**:
You and your friend need to ace 
Friday’s exam to avoid summer classes, and after a week of studying, you both
feel confident that you pulled it off. But when you get your grades back, they’re much lower 
than the two of you expected. You’re devastated. However, your friend doesn't
seem too bothered, and it's making you wonder why you can't
shake this off like they can. But should you really be trying
to look on the bright side? And is controlling our emotions 
even possible in the first place? The answer to the last question
is a definitive “yes.” There are numerous strategies
for regulating our emotions, and one framework to understand these
techniques is called the Process Model. Psychologists use this tool to identify
where and how to intervene in the process that forms our emotions. That process has four steps: first, we enter a situation, 
real or imagined, and that draws our attention. Then we evaluate, or appraise, 
the situation and whether it helps or hinders our goals. Finally, this appraisal leads to a set of 
changes in how we feel, think, and behave, known as an emotional response. Each step of this process offers 
an opportunity to consciously intervene and change our emotions, and the Process Model outlines what 
strategies we might try at each phase. To see this in action, let’s imagine
you’ve been invited to the same party as your least-favorite ex
and their new partner. Your first strategy could be avoiding
the situation altogether by skipping the party. But if you do attend, you could also try 
modifying the situation by choosing not to interact with your ex. If that’s proving difficult,
you might want to shift your attention, maybe by playing a game with your friends rather than focusing 
on your ex’s new partner. Another option would be to re-evaluate
how you think about the situation. After seriously reappraising things, you might realize that you don’t
care who your ex dates. If none of these strategies work, you can always try tempering 
your emotional response after the fact. But this can be tricky. Many of the easiest ways to do this, like hiding your emotions or trying 
to change them with recreational drugs, generally lead to more negative feelings
and health concerns in the long term. More sustainable strategies here include
going for a long walk, taking slow, deep breaths, or talking 
with someone in your support system. While using all these strategies well 
takes practice, learning to notice your emotions and reflect on where they’re coming from
is half the battle. And once you’ve truly internalized 
that you can regulate your emotions, doing so becomes much easier. But should you use these techniques 
to constantly maintain a good mood? That answer depends on how you define
what makes a mood “good.” It's tempting to think we should always
try to avoid sadness and frustration, but no emotion is inherently good or bad— they’re either helpful or unhelpful
depending on the situation. For example, if a friend is telling you
about the loss of a loved one, feeling and expressing sadness 
isn’t just appropriate, it can help you empathize
and support them. Conversely, while it’s unhealthy 
to regularly ignore your emotions, forcing a smile to get through a one-time
annoyance is perfectly reasonable. We hear a lot of mixed messages
about emotions. Some pressure us to stay upbeat while others tell us to simply take 
our emotions as they come. But in reality,
each person has to find their own balance. So if the question is:
“should you always try to be happy?” The answer is no. Studies suggest that people 
fixated on happiness often experience secondary
negative emotions, like guilt, or frustration over being upset, and disappointment that they
don't feel happier. This doesn't mean you should let
sadness or anger take over. But strategies like reappraisal can help
you re-evaluate your thoughts about a situation, allowing you to accept that you feel sad and cultivate hope 
that things will get better.

to look on the bright side? And is controlling our emotions 
even possible in the first place? The answer to the last question
is a definitive “yes.” There are numerous strategies
for regulating our emotions, and one framework to understand these
techniques is called the Process Model. Psychologists use this tool to identify
where and how to intervene in the process that forms our emotions. That process has four steps: first, we enter a situation, 
real or imagined, and that draws our attention. Then we evaluate, or appraise, 
the situation and whether it helps or hinders our goals. Finally, this appraisal leads to a set of 
changes in how we feel, think, and behave, known as an emotional response. Each step of this process offers 
an opportunity to consciously intervene and change our emotions, and the Process Model outlines what 
strategies we might try at each phase. To see this in action, let’s imagine
you’ve been invited to the same party as your least-favorite ex
and their new partner. Your first strategy could be avoiding
the situation altogether by skipping the party. But if you do attend, you could also try 
modifying the situation by choosing not to interact with your ex. If that’s proving difficult,
you might want to shift your attention, maybe by playing a game with your friends rather than focusing 
on your ex’s new partner. Another option would be to re-evaluate
how you think about the situation. After seriously reappraising things, you might realize that you don’t
care who your ex dates. If none of these strategies work, you can always try tempering 
your emotional response after the fact. But this can be tricky. Many of the easiest ways to do this, like hiding your emotions or trying 
to change them with recreational drugs, generally lead to more negative feelings
and health concerns in the long term. More sustainable strategies here include
going for a long walk, taking slow, deep breaths, or talking 
with someone in your support system. While using all these strategies well 
takes practice, learning to notice your emotions and reflect on where they’re coming from
is half the battle. And once you’ve truly internalized 
that you can regulate your emotions, doing so becomes much easier. But should you use these techniques 
to constantly maintain a good mood? That answer depends on how you define
what makes a mood “good.” It's tempting to think we should always
try to avoid sadness and frustration, but no emotion is inherently good or bad— they’re either helpful or unhelpful
depending on the situation. For example, if a friend is telling you
about the loss of a loved one, feeling and expressing sadness 
isn’t just appropriate, it can help you empathize
and support them. Conversely, while it’s unhealthy 
to regularly ignore your emotions, forcing a smile to get through a one-time
annoyance is perfectly reasonable. We hear a lot of mixed messages
about emotions. Some pressure us to stay upbeat while others tell us to simply take 
our emotions as they come. But in reality,
each person has to find their own balance. So if the question is:
“should you always try to be happy?” The answer is no. Studies suggest that people 
fixated on happiness often experience secondary
negative emotions, like guilt, or frustration over being upset, and disappointment that they
don't feel happier. This doesn't mean you should let
sadness or anger take over. But strategies like reappraisal can help
you re-evaluate your thoughts about a situation, allowing you to accept that you feel sad and cultivate hope 
that things will get better.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and options.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 7 is the closest in terms of question intent, as it deals with the regulation of emotional response.

But since the options in Question 7 do not match the ground truth MCQ, I would say that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 7 is the closest.

**Transcript**:
Creating intelligence on a computer. This has been the Holy Grail
for artificial intelligence for quite some time. But how do we get there? So we view ourselves as highly
intelligent beings. So it's logical to study our own brains, the substrate of our cognition,
for creating artificial intelligence. Imagine if we could replicate
how our own brains work on a computer. But now consider the journey
that would be required. The human brain contains
86 billion neurons. Each is constantly communicating
with thousands of others, and each has individual
characteristics of its own. Capturing the human brain on a computer may simply be too big
and too complex a problem to tackle with the technology
and the knowledge that we have today. I believe that we can capture
a brain on a computer, but we have to start smaller. Much smaller. These insects have three of the most
fascinating brains in the world to me. While they do not possess
human-level intelligence, each is remarkable at a particular task. Think of them as highly
trained specialists. African dung beetles are really good
at rolling large balls in straight lines. (Laughter) Now, if you've ever made a snowman, you know that rolling
a large ball is not easy. Now picture trying to make that snowman when the ball of snow is as big as you are and you're standing on your head. (Laughter) Sahara desert ants
are navigation specialists. They might have to wander a considerable
distance to forage for food. But once they do find sustenance, they know how to calculate
the straightest path home. And the dragonfly is a hunting specialist. In the wild, dragonflies capture
approximately 95 percent of the prey they choose to go after. These insects are so good
at their specialties that neuroscientists such as myself
study them as model systems to understand how animal nervous systems
solve particular problems. And in my own research, I study brains
to bring these solutions, the best that biology
has to offer, to computers. So consider the dragonfly brain. It has only on the order
of one million neurons. Now, it's still not easy to unravel
a circuit of even one million neurons. But given the choice between trying to tease apart
the one-million-neuron brain versus the 86-billion-neuron brain, which would you choose to try first? (Laughter) When studying these smaller insect brains, the immediate goal
is not human intelligence. We study these brains
for what the insects do well. And in the case of the dragonfly,
that's interception. So when dragonflies are hunting, they do more than just fly
straight at the prey. They fly in such a way
that they will intercept it. They aim for where
the prey is going to be. Much like a soccer player,
running to intercept a pass. To do this correctly, dragonflies need to perform what is known
as a coordinate transformation, going from the eye’s frame of reference,
or what the dragonfly sees, to the body's frame of reference, or how the dragonfly needs
to turn its body to intercept. Coordinate transformations
are a basic calculation that animals need to perform
to interact with the world. We do them instinctively
every time we reach for something. When I reach for an object
straight in front of me, my arm takes a very different trajectory
than if I turn my head, look at that same object
when it is off to one side and reach for it there. In both cases, my eyes see
the same image of that object, but my brain is sending my arm
on a very different trajectory based on the position of my neck. And dragonflies are fast. This means they calculate fast. The latency, or the time it takes
for a dragonfly to respond once it sees the prey turn, is about 50 milliseconds. This latency is remarkable. For one thing, it's only half
the time of a human eye blink. But for another thing, it suggests that dragonflies
capture how to intercept in only relatively or surprisingly
few computational steps. So in the brain, a computational step is a single neuron or a layer of neurons working in parallel. It takes a single neuron
about 10 milliseconds to add up all its inputs and respond. The 50-millisecond response time means that once the dragonfly
sees its prey turn, there's only time for maybe four
of these computational steps or four layers of neurons,
working in sequence, one after the other, to calculate how
the dragonfly needs to turn. In other words, if I want to study how the dragonfly does
coordinate transformations, the neural circuit
that I need to understand, the neural circuit that I need to study, can have at most four layers of neurons. Each layer may have many neurons, but this is a small neural circuit. Small enough that we can identify it and study it with the tools
that are available today. And this is what I'm trying to do. I have built a model of what I believe
is the neural circuit that calculates how
the dragonfly should turn. And here is the cool result. In the model, dragonflies do coordinate transformations
in only one computational step, one layer of neurons. This is something
we can test and understand. In a computer simulation, I can predict the activities
of individual neurons while the dragonfly is hunting. For example, here I am predicting
the action potentials, or the spikes, that are fired by one of these neurons when the dragonfly sees the prey move. To test the model, my collaborators and I are now comparing
these predicted neural responses with responses of neurons
recorded in living dragonfly brains. These are ongoing experiments in which we put living dragonflies
in virtual reality. (Laughter) Now, it's not practical to put
VR goggles on a dragonfly. So instead, we show movies
of moving targets to the dragonfly, while an electrode records activity
patterns of individual neurons in the brain. Yeah, he likes the movies. If the responses
that we record in the brain match those predicted by the model, we will have identified
which neurons are responsible for coordinate transformations. The next step will be
to understand the specifics of how these neurons work together
to do the calculation. But this is how we begin to understand
how brains do basic or primitive calculations. Calculations that I regard as building
blocks for more complex functions, not only for interception
but also for cognition. The way that these neurons compute
may be different from anything that exists on a computer today. And the goal of this work
is to do more than just write code that replicates the activity
patterns of neurons. We aim to build a computer chip that not only does the same things
as biological brains but does them in the same way
as biological brains. This could lead to drones
driven by computers the same size of the dragonfly's brain that captures some targets
and avoid others. Personally, I'm hoping
for a small army of these to defend my backyard
from mosquitoes in the summer. (Laughter) The GPS on your phone could be replaced
by a new navigation device based on dung beetles or ants that could guide you to the straight
or the easy path home. And what would the power requirements
of these devices be like? As small as it is -- Or, sorry -- as large as it is, the human brain is estimated
to have the same power requirements as a 20-watt light bulb. Imagine if all brain-inspired computers had the same extremely
low-power requirements. Your smartphone or your smartwatch
probably needs charging every day. Your new brain-inspired device might only
need charging every few months, or maybe even every few years. The famous physicist,
Richard Feynman, once said, "What I cannot create,
I do not understand." What I see in insect nervous systems is an opportunity to understand brains through the creation of computers
that work as brains do. And creation of these computers
will not just be for knowledge. There's potential for real impact
on your devices, your vehicles, maybe even artificial intelligences. So next time you see an insect, consider that these tiny brains
can lead to remarkable computers. And think of the potential
that they offer us for the future. Thank you. (Applause)

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ is about the specific task that dragonflies must perform to intercept their prey correctly, which is "coordinate transformation." Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is related to the neural circuit for coordinate transformations, but it's not a direct match.

If I had to choose the closest match, I would suggest Question 4, but with a note that it's not an exact match. However, since the instructions require providing the index of the most similar generated MCQ, I will provide it:

Index: 4

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the task dragonflies must perform to intercept their prey correctly, with options including "coordinate transformation."

**Transcript**:
Odin, the king of Asgard, 
was plagued by nightmares. Three fearsome figures haunted his dreams: a massive, writhing shadow; a shambling, rotting corpse; and worst of all, 
a monstrous beast with a deadly bite. Night after night, the creatures
besieged the king. And although their true forms
were unknown to him, he could tell they were related 
to Asgard’s most persistent problem: Loki. Despite having settled down
with his wife and sons, Loki had been sneaking off to visit 
the giantess Angrboda. And when the king learned this affair
had produced three children, he was filled with unease. Odin summoned Thor and Tyr, 
two of his bravest warriors, to travel to Jotunheim to capture 
Loki’s secret children. Upon arriving at Angrboda’s home, the pair were immediately accosted
by Loki's first child, a serpent named Jörmungandr. The God of Thunder dodged 
the snake’s venom and swiftly bound him to a pine tree. The second child, Hel, appeared as 
a glowing young woman from the right and a moldering corpse from the left. Her flesh flaked onto the ground 
as she silently submitted to her captors. Finally, the third child leapt at Tyr. The small wolf was fierce but harmless. Tyr playfully cuffed its claws 
and stowed the cub in his pocket. Back in Asgard, the warriors
presented their prisoners and fearful recognition
seized Odin's heart. Though these three were meager reflections
of his dark dreams, the king was determined to dispose 
of them before his visions came true. First, he banished Jörmungandr 
to the sea at the edge of the world. Then he sent Hel deep below the earth
to join her fellow corpses. But the wolf, named Fenrir, 
presented a challenge. He’d already grown strong
enough to threaten the gods, so Odin took a more patient approach. For months, he supervised the creature,
watching Fenrir grow from a cub to a wolf to a beast 
who spoke with the voice of a God. Tyr visited frequently and found Fenrir
to be strong and clever. But as their bond deepened,
Odin's fear only grew. One day, Odin forged his heaviest chains and hauled them to Fenrir 
with a challenge. He would bind the wolf
to test his growing strength. Fenrir eagerly accepted the challenge 
and splintered the metal like old wood. Odin returned to the forge, crafting
shackles that no man could lift alone. These sturdy chains gave Fenrir pause. But with an encouraging wink from Tyr,
he accepted the challenge. The beast strained for a moment 
and then shattered his restraints into a thousand pieces. Desperate, Odin sought help 
from the most skilled makers of all: the Dwarves. Rather than metal, they sought 
the rarest ingredients; from feline footsteps and fish breath to the sinews of mountains 
and mighty bears. With these, the Dwarves crafted Gleipnir, an unbreakable chain in the guise 
of fine thread. When Odin challenged Fenrir a third time, 
the wolf laughed. But as he examined the thread 
more closely, Fenrir sensed Odin’s trickery 
and began to feel some fear himself. Fenrir struck a deal. He would accept the challenge, but only if a god kept their hand 
in his mouth throughout. With a heavy heart, Tyr volunteered. The gods bound the wolf and as he strained
Gleipnir only grew tighter. Fenrir felt the agony of betrayal— not only from Odin,
but from his reluctant friend. With a howl of fury, 
he bit through Tyr’s wrist and vowed to destroy Odin 
for tricking him. Watching his nightmare come to life, Odin thrust Tyr’s blade
between Fenrir jaws, releasing a torrent of saliva 
that became a furious river. While the beast was not dead, 
he was bound, and Odin celebrated his victory over fate. But in truth, his actions had
only sealed his doom. Beneath the waves, 
Jörmungandr grew to encircle the world. Hel rose to rule the dead
as queen of the Underworld. And every day, Fenrir strained 
a little more against his chains, inching ever closer to his bloody revenge.

presented their prisoners and fearful recognition
seized Odin's heart. Though these three were meager reflections
of his dark dreams, the king was determined to dispose 
of them before his visions came true. First, he banished Jörmungandr 
to the sea at the edge of the world. Then he sent Hel deep below the earth
to join her fellow corpses. But the wolf, named Fenrir, 
presented a challenge. He’d already grown strong
enough to threaten the gods, so Odin took a more patient approach. For months, he supervised the creature,
watching Fenrir grow from a cub to a wolf to a beast 
who spoke with the voice of a God. Tyr visited frequently and found Fenrir
to be strong and clever. But as their bond deepened,
Odin's fear only grew. One day, Odin forged his heaviest chains and hauled them to Fenrir 
with a challenge. He would bind the wolf
to test his growing strength. Fenrir eagerly accepted the challenge 
and splintered the metal like old wood. Odin returned to the forge, crafting
shackles that no man could lift alone. These sturdy chains gave Fenrir pause. But with an encouraging wink from Tyr,
he accepted the challenge. The beast strained for a moment 
and then shattered his restraints into a thousand pieces. Desperate, Odin sought help 
from the most skilled makers of all: the Dwarves. Rather than metal, they sought 
the rarest ingredients; from feline footsteps and fish breath to the sinews of mountains 
and mighty bears. With these, the Dwarves crafted Gleipnir, an unbreakable chain in the guise 
of fine thread. When Odin challenged Fenrir a third time, 
the wolf laughed. But as he examined the thread 
more closely, Fenrir sensed Odin’s trickery 
and began to feel some fear himself. Fenrir struck a deal. He would accept the challenge, but only if a god kept their hand 
in his mouth throughout. With a heavy heart, Tyr volunteered. The gods bound the wolf and as he strained
Gleipnir only grew tighter. Fenrir felt the agony of betrayal— not only from Odin,
but from his reluctant friend. With a howl of fury, 
he bit through Tyr’s wrist and vowed to destroy Odin 
for tricking him. Watching his nightmare come to life, Odin thrust Tyr’s blade
between Fenrir jaws, releasing a torrent of saliva 
that became a furious river. While the beast was not dead, 
he was bound, and Odin celebrated his victory over fate. But in truth, his actions had
only sealed his doom. Beneath the waves, 
Jörmungandr grew to encircle the world. Hel rose to rule the dead
as queen of the Underworld. And every day, Fenrir strained 
a little more against his chains, inching ever closer to his bloody revenge.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3: What is the name of the wolf that is one of Loki's children? Options: A. Jörmungandr, B. Fenrir, C. Hel, D. Sleipnir.

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the forms that Loki's children took, and Question 3 asks about the name of the wolf that is one of Loki's children. Both questions are related to Loki's children and their forms or identities.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the forms or shapes that Loki's children took, with options that include a serpent, a wolf, a corpse, and a dragon.

**Transcript**:
Odin, the king of Asgard, 
was plagued by nightmares. Three fearsome figures haunted his dreams: a massive, writhing shadow; a shambling, rotting corpse; and worst of all, 
a monstrous beast with a deadly bite. Night after night, the creatures
besieged the king. And although their true forms
were unknown to him, he could tell they were related 
to Asgard’s most persistent problem: Loki. Despite having settled down
with his wife and sons, Loki had been sneaking off to visit 
the giantess Angrboda. And when the king learned this affair
had produced three children, he was filled with unease. Odin summoned Thor and Tyr, 
two of his bravest warriors, to travel to Jotunheim to capture 
Loki’s secret children. Upon arriving at Angrboda’s home, the pair were immediately accosted
by Loki's first child, a serpent named Jörmungandr. The God of Thunder dodged 
the snake’s venom and swiftly bound him to a pine tree. The second child, Hel, appeared as 
a glowing young woman from the right and a moldering corpse from the left. Her flesh flaked onto the ground 
as she silently submitted to her captors. Finally, the third child leapt at Tyr. The small wolf was fierce but harmless. Tyr playfully cuffed its claws 
and stowed the cub in his pocket. Back in Asgard, the warriors

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: Who volunteered to keep their hand in Fenrir's mouth as part of the challenge? 

This question is similar in content and intent to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about Fenrir's actions while imprisoned at Asgard and mentions his friendship with Tyr. Although the generated MCQ does not directly ask about Fenrir's actions or friendship, it does involve Tyr's interaction with Fenrir, which is a key aspect of the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ could be one that directly asks about Fenrir's actions or friendship while imprisoned at Asgard. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the provided generated MCQs.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 6.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What is the name of the unbreakable chain forged by the Dwarves? 

However, since the ground truth MCQ asks "Who made Gleipnir?", the more accurate match would be a question that asks about the creator of Gleipnir, not the name of the chain itself. 

A more suitable match would be Question 4: Who forged the heaviest chains to bind Fenrir? However, this question does not specifically mention Gleipnir.

Considering the options provided, the closest match is Question 5, but it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose, I would say Question 5 is the closest match, but a more accurate match would be a question that specifically asks "Who made Gleipnir?" which is not present in the generated MCQs.

However, I noticed that Question 4 has an option that says "The Dwarves" which is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ. 

Therefore, I would say the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, but it's not a perfect match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the question content is not identical, both questions relate to the event of Fenrir biting through Tyr's wrist. In the ground truth MCQ, the focus is on the natural formation created when Fenrir was bound, which is a river formed by the torrent of saliva released when Odin thrust Tyr's blade between Fenrir's jaws. Question 8 describes this event in its options, specifically option C, which states "Odin thrust Tyr's blade between Fenrir's jaws." 

While not a perfect match, Question 8 is the most similar generated MCQ in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
Baritone thunder. Snarling winds. 
Consuming downpours. Okeechobee, the disastrous hurricane 
of 1928, tore through the North Atlantic basin,
laying waste to entire communities. In Eatonville, Florida, 
the storm forced many to flee. But for Janie Crawford, 
it inspired an unexpected homecoming. Janie’s return begins 
“Their Eyes Were Watching God,” Zora Neale Hurston’s acclaimed novel about a Black woman’s quest 
for love and agency in a time that sought to deprive 
her of both. When Janie arrives back in Eatonville,
her arrival is shrouded in mystery. Her neighbors and friends are quick
to gossip about her reappearance, her finances, and most importantly, 
the whereabouts of her missing husband. But only Janie’s friend Pheoby
gets to hear the whole story. Over the course of a conversation 
that spans most of the novel, Hurston untangles Janie’s life story; from her complicated childhood 
and her life in Eatonville, to her scandalous departure 
and the shocking events that followed. The specifics of Janie’s story
are often larger than life, but many of the book’s details reflect 
the incredible experiences of its author. Zora Neale Hurston was
raised in Eatonville, one of the first planned and incorporated
all-Black communities in America. Like Janie, she also left
Eatonville abruptly, traveling first to Jacksonville and DC,
before eventually moving further north. In New York City, 
Hurston studied anthropology and became a renowned author 
in the Harlem Renaissance, a cultural, literary and artistic movement
that’s still considered a golden era of Black artistry and creativity. Here, her work garnered enough support 
to fund research trips through the South, where she collected stories and folktales
from Black Americans. By 1937, her fieldwork had taken
her all the way to Haiti, where she wrote most 
of “Their Eyes Were Watching God.” Hurston drew on all these experiences
for the novel, incorporating folkloric elements alongside
her own family and romantic history to bring readers into the intimate spaces 
of Black southern life. She uses regional phrases and sayings to capture the dialect 
of her Floridian characters. And the novel’s omniscient 
third-person narration allows Hurston to unleash 
her poetic prose on everything from birdsong, architecture, and fashion, to her characters’ deepest feelings 
and motivations. Perhaps more than any specific details, Hurston’s experiences of being 
a Black woman in America at this time are more evident in the novel’s themes. Over the course of one long evening, Janie and Pheoby discuss the nature of
family, marriage, spirituality and more. But their conversation always comes back
to Janie’s truest desire: to live honestly 
and be truly loved in return. As a teenager, Janie resents 
an arranged marriage, despite the safety it offers her 
and the wishes of her loving grandmother. When her family becomes well-respected 
in Eatonville, she struggles with the
judgmental eyes of strangers and a husband who wants her 
to be something she’s not. Throughout her life, Janie frequently
feels she’s at the whim of natural and spiritual forces that can shift the course of her existence
without warning. And when she finally does find true love, these unknowable powers 
continue to act on her, threatening to destroy the life
she's so painstakingly built. The story takes place during a time where
women had little to no agency, and Janie’s life is full 
of complicated characters who demand different kinds 
of love and submission. But despite the loneliness 
of her situation, Janie navigates these trials 
with defiance and curiosity. Her questions and commentary 
push back in subtle, clever ways. And as the reader follows Janie’s journey
from childhood to middle age, her confidence becomes infectious. Just like Hurston, Janie defies 
the restrictive expectations for a woman in her time. Early in the novel, Hurston writes that “there are years that ask questions
and years that answer,” suggesting that life can only truly 
be understood by living it. But through her empathetic storytelling, Hurston invites us into Janie’s life, 
her life, and the lives of so many other women.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the main character in the novel. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 4 asks about the character who gets to hear Janie's whole story. This question is related to the main character, Janie, and her interactions with other characters.

However, a more relevant question would be one that directly asks about Janie or her role in the novel. Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is about the title of the novel, which features Janie as the main character. 

But the most relevant question would be one that directly asks about Janie or the main character. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask this question directly.

Considering the options, I would choose Question 4 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it is the closest to mentioning Janie, the main character.

**Transcript**:
Baritone thunder. Snarling winds. 
Consuming downpours. Okeechobee, the disastrous hurricane 
of 1928, tore through the North Atlantic basin,
laying waste to entire communities. In Eatonville, Florida, 
the storm forced many to flee. But for Janie Crawford, 
it inspired an unexpected homecoming. Janie’s return begins 
“Their Eyes Were Watching God,” Zora Neale Hurston’s acclaimed novel about a Black woman’s quest 
for love and agency in a time that sought to deprive 
her of both. When Janie arrives back in Eatonville,
her arrival is shrouded in mystery. Her neighbors and friends are quick
to gossip about her reappearance, her finances, and most importantly, 
the whereabouts of her missing husband. But only Janie’s friend Pheoby
gets to hear the whole story. Over the course of a conversation 
that spans most of the novel, Hurston untangles Janie’s life story; from her complicated childhood 
and her life in Eatonville, to her scandalous departure 
and the shocking events that followed. The specifics of Janie’s story
are often larger than life, but many of the book’s details reflect 
the incredible experiences of its author. Zora Neale Hurston was
raised in Eatonville, one of the first planned and incorporated
all-Black communities in America. Like Janie, she also left
Eatonville abruptly, traveling first to Jacksonville and DC,
before eventually moving further north. In New York City, 
Hurston studied anthropology and became a renowned author 
in the Harlem Renaissance, a cultural, literary and artistic movement
that’s still considered a golden era of Black artistry and creativity. Here, her work garnered enough support 
to fund research trips through the South, where she collected stories and folktales
from Black Americans. By 1937, her fieldwork had taken
her all the way to Haiti, where she wrote most 
of “Their Eyes Were Watching God.” Hurston drew on all these experiences
for the novel, incorporating folkloric elements alongside
her own family and romantic history to bring readers into the intimate spaces 
of Black southern life. She uses regional phrases and sayings to capture the dialect 
of her Floridian characters. And the novel’s omniscient 
third-person narration allows Hurston to unleash 
her poetic prose on everything from birdsong, architecture, and fashion, to her characters’ deepest feelings 
and motivations. Perhaps more than any specific details, Hurston’s experiences of being

of love and submission. But despite the loneliness 
of her situation, Janie navigates these trials 
with defiance and curiosity. Her questions and commentary 
push back in subtle, clever ways. And as the reader follows Janie’s journey
from childhood to middle age, her confidence becomes infectious. Just like Hurston, Janie defies 
the restrictive expectations for a woman in her time. Early in the novel, Hurston writes that “there are years that ask questions
and years that answer,” suggesting that life can only truly 
be understood by living it. But through her empathetic storytelling, Hurston invites us into Janie’s life, 
her life, and the lives of so many other women.

**Transcript**:
In 1776, a powerful empire was
born in North America. The Lakotas had reached the Black Hills, the most sacred place and most coveted
buffalo hunting grounds in the western plains. Located in what is now South Dakota, 
control of the Black Hills, or Paha Sapa, marked the Lakotas as the dominant power
in the American West. Just a few decades before, they were vying
for power in the eastern woodlands— and losing. One of seven nations, 
or seven council fires, that made up the Sioux Alliance, the Lakotas had lived in the forests
and wetlands between the Great Lakes 
and the Missouri Valley for centuries. In the 1600s, European colonizers
destabilized this region. While some tribes profited by trading
furs with new France, the Lakotas lived just out of range
of the best trade opportunities. So in the early 1700s,
they turned their attention west. The western plains were much less fertile
and abundant than the Lakotas’ homelands. The only easy access to food and water
was immediately alongside the rivers— land Arikaras had already claimed. To compete, the Lakotas became 
skilled buffalo hunters and warriors on horseback. They conquered the farming Arikaras, forcing them to pay tributes
of maize and squash. When the Spanish arrived expecting
to find lucrative trading grounds, they had to pay tolls 
to the Lakotas instead. In 1804, a new spectacle came floating
up the Missouri River: Merriwether Lewis and William Clark. Lakota chief Black Buffalo refused to let
them pass until they paid a hefty tribute. In spite of this rocky start, the expedition marked the beginning
of a close trade alliance between the Lakotas and the United States. Lakota men hunted buffalo, while women
processed the hides into robes for trade. The US government supplied guns,
ammunition, and other goods, even providing Lakotas with smallpox
vaccines that protected them from the deadly epidemics that ravaged
other Native American nations. On paper, the United States had acquired
the Lakotas’ lands from France in the Louisiana Purchase. But the Lakotas would not cede their lands because of an agreement 
between two foreign powers. Though there were 15,000 Lakotas
and 23 million Americans, the bulk of US population and military
might was concentrated on the east coast. Just getting an army to Lakota territory
presented a huge expense, and once there they would face 
formidable warriors with deep local knowledge and alliances. To avoid a war it couldn’t afford 
and wouldn’t win, the US government attempted to appease 
the Lakotas, paying steep tributes of ammunition 
and rations demanded by Lakota leaders. So while almost all the Native Americans
in North America were being forced off their lands 
and onto reservations, the Lakota Empire was still expanding. By 1850, they controlled 
some 500,000 square kilometers. They were spread thinly
across this vast area, moving their villages 
in pursuit of Buffalo. Though there was no central authority, the leaders of bands, or oyates, 
came together at annual Sun Dances to strategize and coordinate complex
diplomatic operations. Lasting a few weeks each summer, Sun Dances were spiritual ceremonies 
that reaffirmed communal ties, appeased Wakan Tanka, the Great Spirit,
and kept the world in balance. Starting in 1849, the California gold rush
brought hordes of white settlers west, encroaching on Lakota territory
and disturbing the buffalo herds. Lakota leaders correctly interpreted
this migration as a signal that the US no longer intended 
to respect their claim to the land. In retaliation, they attacked wagon trains
and government offices. As the conflict grew, Chief Red Cloud
negotiated in Washington DC. While back in Lakota territory, chiefs 
Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and others prepared for battle. They mobilized their Cheyenne 
and Arapaho allies and almost all the other Sioux nations 
against the US. In 1876, exactly 100 years after
the Lakotas’ arrival, gold prospectors occupied 
the sacred Black Hills. For many Lakotas, 
this was the final straw. Following a vision by Sitting Bull, 
Crazy Horse led Lakota forces to decisively defeat the Americans 
in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. After this victory, the Lakotas
faced an even graver threat: wagon travel and railroad construction
had decimated buffalo populations, and they faced starvation. To survive, they moved on to reservations, where the authorities murdered 
Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse and attempted to dismantle their culture, 
prohibiting the Sun Dance on reservations. The Lakotas started a protest movement
called the Ghost Dance. Alarmed by this resistance, in 1890,
the US Army massacred hundreds of Lakotas, many of them women and children,
at Wounded Knee Creek. Today, Lakotas continue to fight 
for their culture and their land. In 2016, they drew supporters worldwide
to protest construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline 
through their reservation, continuing a long history of resistance to a government
known for breaking its promises.

and onto reservations, the Lakota Empire was still expanding. By 1850, they controlled 
some 500,000 square kilometers. They were spread thinly
across this vast area, moving their villages 
in pursuit of Buffalo. Though there was no central authority, the leaders of bands, or oyates, 
came together at annual Sun Dances to strategize and coordinate complex
diplomatic operations. Lasting a few weeks each summer, Sun Dances were spiritual ceremonies 
that reaffirmed communal ties, appeased Wakan Tanka, the Great Spirit,
and kept the world in balance. Starting in 1849, the California gold rush
brought hordes of white settlers west, encroaching on Lakota territory
and disturbing the buffalo herds. Lakota leaders correctly interpreted
this migration as a signal that the US no longer intended 
to respect their claim to the land. In retaliation, they attacked wagon trains
and government offices. As the conflict grew, Chief Red Cloud
negotiated in Washington DC. While back in Lakota territory, chiefs 
Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and others prepared for battle. They mobilized their Cheyenne 
and Arapaho allies and almost all the other Sioux nations 
against the US. In 1876, exactly 100 years after
the Lakotas’ arrival, gold prospectors occupied 
the sacred Black Hills. For many Lakotas, 
this was the final straw. Following a vision by Sitting Bull, 
Crazy Horse led Lakota forces to decisively defeat the Americans 
in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. After this victory, the Lakotas
faced an even graver threat: wagon travel and railroad construction
had decimated buffalo populations, and they faced starvation. To survive, they moved on to reservations, where the authorities murdered 
Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse and attempted to dismantle their culture, 
prohibiting the Sun Dance on reservations. The Lakotas started a protest movement
called the Ghost Dance. Alarmed by this resistance, in 1890,
the US Army massacred hundreds of Lakotas, many of them women and children,
at Wounded Knee Creek. Today, Lakotas continue to fight 
for their culture and their land. In 2016, they drew supporters worldwide
to protest construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline 
through their reservation, continuing a long history of resistance to a government
known for breaking its promises.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Joseph Geni
Reviewer: Morton Bast So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s. When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid. But my tiger mother said, "No." My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them. After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness: a safe and well-paid job. It is not important if I like the job or not. But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer. That is me playing my imaginary piano. An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics, so I tried everything I could to go to opera school. I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show. But no adults liked the idea. No adults believed I was serious. Only my friends supported me, but they were kids, just as powerless as I was. So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained. My dream would never come true. I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for. But that's so unfair. So I was determined to find another calling. Nobody around to teach me? Fine. I turned to books. I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"] I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"] And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"] And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these. ["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin] I came to the U.S. in 1995, so which books did I read here first? Books banned in China, of course. "The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life. That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it. The Bible is interesting, but strange. (Laughter) That's a topic for a different day. But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany: "You shall honor your father and mother." "Honor," I said. "That's so different, and better, than obey." So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents. Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading. It offers many insights. For example, I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with. It had never occurred to me, China doesn't have to be at the center of the world. A map actually carries somebody's view. Comparative reading actually is nothing new. It's a standard practice in the academic world. There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature. Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic. So I thought, well, if comparative reading works for research, why not do it in daily life too? So I started reading books in pairs. So they can be about people -- ["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] -- who are involved in the same event, or friends with shared experiences. ["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder] I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter) [Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] -- or similar stories from different cultures, as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell] For example, both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations. For the Christ, the temptations are economic, political and spiritual. For the Buddha, they are all psychological: lust, fear and social duty -- interesting. So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages. ["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts] Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain. For example, it's through translation that I realized "happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh! "Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh. (Laughter) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present. I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again. Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered. I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream. Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from. Even a shattered dream can do that for you. So because of books, I'm here today, happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity, most of the time. So may books be always with you. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

“Dictionary:” noun, 
“a malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language 
and making it hard and inelastic.” “Lexicographer:” noun, “a writer 
of dictionaries; a harmless drudge.” While the concept of a dictionary 
dates back to ancient civilizations, the first English dictionary was published
by Robert Cawdrey in 1604. In the centuries that followed, many more dictionaries were written 
by individual authors who chose what to include or exclude. They not only defined words, they openly 
showcased their creators’ opinions— like Ambrose Bierce’s definition
of “dictionary” and Samuel Johnson’s definition
of “lexicographer.” After their authors deaths, many of these
dictionaries quickly became outdated. But one 19th century dictionary
had a different fate. In 1828, American lawyer and author
Noah Webster published “An American Dictionary of the 
English Language” with a lofty goal: to give the United States its own version
of the English language. He believed that as a new nation, the United States needed its own distinct
version of English to assert its independence from Britain. In his dictionary, Webster sought 
to describe and officialize the way Americans spoke. Most dictionaries in Webster’s time 
were prescriptive: they dictated how words should be used, rather than documenting the way people 
actually used language in daily life. When Webster broke this convention and 
included slang words in his dictionary, critics accused him of polluting
the English language. But he argued that these words captured
local variations of language— a vital part of what made
American English unique. He also believed spelling rules
were unnecessarily complex, and that we should write the way
we speak as much as possible. Still, Webster’s own opinions influenced
the words he included and the way he defined them. He excluded slang words 
from Black communities because he didn’t consider them proper. And when he defined “woman,” he added that “women are soft, 
mild, pitiful, and flexible.” By the time of his death, 
Noah Webster was a household name. Seeing a lucrative business opportunity, brothers George and Charles Merriam bought
the rights to Webster’s Dictionary. Together with Webster’s son-in-law, 
the Merriams made a new, revised edition. It was the beginning 
of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Today, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary
begins to address a contradiction in Webster’s goal: he wanted to represent an entire nation, but he based his work on just one person’s
opinion: his own. Since Webster’s death, each new edition
of the dictionary has been curated by a group of language experts rather
than by a single authority. The current criteria for
including a word in the dictionary are that it has “widespread,
sustained, and meaningful use.” This clearly includes profanities, which were sometimes excluded 
from dictionaries in the past. Racial slurs also meet
the criteria for inclusion, but some argue that including
them might legitimize them. Dictionaries don’t just add new words— they also redefine old words to reflect
changing attitudes and usage. One 1736 dictionary defined “wife”
as “a married woman whose will, in the judgment of the law, is subject
to the will of her husband: for which reason a wife is
said to have no will.” Today, “wife” is defined simply as 
“a female partner in a marriage.” In 2019, Merriam-Webster’s word
of the year was “they.” The word has been in regular
use for centuries, but has only recently gained a new
recognized meaning, as a pronoun for one person whose 
gender identity is nonbinary. The question of which words belong 
in the dictionary impacts all of us— when our words and definitions 
are represented, they’re affirmed; if not, they— and we— are minimized. Today, lexicographers have expanded 
word sourcing to include the dictionary’s users:
tracking which words are most searched, and adding them to the dictionary. So, who decides what’s in the dictionary? More than ever before the answer is: 
we do. All of us shape language every day. When we collectively embrace one word 
or redefine another, eventually, those words and meanings
are reflected in our dictionaries.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks, "When is a dictionary finished being written?" and the correct option is "Until their next edition." This implies that a dictionary is not a static entity and is subject to revisions and updates.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is the most relevant, but it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I found that Question 8 is slightly more related, as it talks about who decides what's in the dictionary, which implies that the dictionary is a dynamic entity that is shaped by the collective efforts of people.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, as it talks about the criteria for including a word in the dictionary, which implies that the dictionary is subject to updates and revisions.

from Black communities because he didn’t consider them proper. And when he defined “woman,” he added that “women are soft, 
mild, pitiful, and flexible.” By the time of his death, 
Noah Webster was a household name. Seeing a lucrative business opportunity, brothers George and Charles Merriam bought
the rights to Webster’s Dictionary. Together with Webster’s son-in-law, 
the Merriams made a new, revised edition. It was the beginning 
of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Today, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary
begins to address a contradiction in Webster’s goal: he wanted to represent an entire nation, but he based his work on just one person’s
opinion: his own. Since Webster’s death, each new edition
of the dictionary has been curated by a group of language experts rather
than by a single authority. The current criteria for
including a word in the dictionary are that it has “widespread,
sustained, and meaningful use.” This clearly includes profanities, which were sometimes excluded 
from dictionaries in the past. Racial slurs also meet
the criteria for inclusion, but some argue that including
them might legitimize them. Dictionaries don’t just add new words— they also redefine old words to reflect
changing attitudes and usage. One 1736 dictionary defined “wife”
as “a married woman whose will, in the judgment of the law, is subject
to the will of her husband: for which reason a wife is
said to have no will.” Today, “wife” is defined simply as 
“a female partner in a marriage.” In 2019, Merriam-Webster’s word
of the year was “they.” The word has been in regular
use for centuries, but has only recently gained a new
recognized meaning, as a pronoun for one person whose 
gender identity is nonbinary. The question of which words belong 
in the dictionary impacts all of us— when our words and definitions 
are represented, they’re affirmed; if not, they— and we— are minimized. Today, lexicographers have expanded 
word sourcing to include the dictionary’s users:
tracking which words are most searched, and adding them to the dictionary. So, who decides what’s in the dictionary? More than ever before the answer is: 
we do. All of us shape language every day. When we collectively embrace one word 
or redefine another, eventually, those words and meanings
are reflected in our dictionaries.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of words in the English language, while the generated MCQs cover various topics related to dictionaries, language, and lexicographers.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of language and dictionaries, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match. It asks about the criteria for including a word in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, which is related to the concept of language and dictionaries.

**Transcript**:
“Dictionary:” noun, 
“a malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language 
and making it hard and inelastic.” “Lexicographer:” noun, “a writer 
of dictionaries; a harmless drudge.” While the concept of a dictionary 
dates back to ancient civilizations, the first English dictionary was published
by Robert Cawdrey in 1604. In the centuries that followed, many more dictionaries were written 
by individual authors who chose what to include or exclude. They not only defined words, they openly 
showcased their creators’ opinions— like Ambrose Bierce’s definition
of “dictionary” and Samuel Johnson’s definition
of “lexicographer.” After their authors deaths, many of these
dictionaries quickly became outdated. But one 19th century dictionary
had a different fate. In 1828, American lawyer and author
Noah Webster published “An American Dictionary of the 
English Language” with a lofty goal: to give the United States its own version
of the English language. He believed that as a new nation, the United States needed its own distinct
version of English to assert its independence from Britain. In his dictionary, Webster sought 
to describe and officialize the way Americans spoke. Most dictionaries in Webster’s time 
were prescriptive: they dictated how words should be used, rather than documenting the way people 
actually used language in daily life. When Webster broke this convention and 
included slang words in his dictionary, critics accused him of polluting
the English language. But he argued that these words captured
local variations of language— a vital part of what made
American English unique. He also believed spelling rules
were unnecessarily complex, and that we should write the way
we speak as much as possible. Still, Webster’s own opinions influenced
the words he included and the way he defined them. He excluded slang words 
from Black communities because he didn’t consider them proper. And when he defined “woman,” he added that “women are soft,

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Samuel Johnson's origin, whereas the generated MCQs do not have a direct match. However, Question 2 mentions Samuel Johnson as an option, although the question is about who published the first English dictionary.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2. However, please note that this is not a direct match, and the question content and options are different.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about a language that doesn't change, while the generated MCQs are related to the transcript's content, focusing on dictionaries, language evolution, and lexicographers.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept of language change or evolution, I would select Question 10: "What is the impact of dictionaries on language and society?"

**Transcript**:
In the middle of the 19th century, the California gold rush brought thousands
of settlers to America’s west coast. But finding gold may have been easier 
than transporting it back east. The only hope for avoiding 
a grueling six month wagon journey was to travel the narrowest portion 
of the continent— the 48-kilometer Isthmus of Panama. By 1855, a railroad spanning the region
significantly shortened to the trip, but unloading and reloading ships
at each port cost time and money. To truly connect these two bodies of water
shipping interests needed a canal— a continuous maritime passage
through the isthmus. The first attempt at this colossal
construction project was taken up in 1881 by French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps. De Lesseps had supervised construction
of Egypt's Suez Canal, but his success made him overconfident. He insisted on digging the canal 
at sea level, even though it required boring 
directly through the Continental Divide mountain range. Futile excavation efforts were buried
under constant landslides. And since the diplomat had only 
visited the site briefly during Panama’s dry season, his workers were unprepared for 
torrential storms, venomous jungle fauna, and tropical diseases. After spending $287 million 
and losing a staggering 22,000 lives, the French abandoned the project. The United States had been considering
building a canal through Nicaragua, but at this point, the chance to succeed
where France failed was tempting. Panamanian leaders were also eager 
to complete a canal which would bring their country
business and prestige. However, Panama was still a part
of Colombia at the time, and the country was stalling negotiations
with the U.S. Sensing an opportunity, President Teddy Roosevelt 
went straight to the Panamanians. With encouragement and military support 
from the U.S., Panama launched a coup in 1903. Within days, they became 
an independent nation and signed a treaty to begin 
construction of the canal. Just over a decade after the French left,
the Americans were ready to dig in— and they were determined to avoid
their predecessor’s mistakes. Instead of cutting the mountain
down to sea level, they would raise the sea up the mountain. The plan was to build massive steel gates separating the canal into multiple
chambers with different water levels. As a ship passed through each 
successive gate would open, lowering the water level 
in the next chamber, while raising the ship 
and allowing it to move on. The design called for five 
of these so-called canal locks— three on the Atlantic side
and two on the Pacific, raising traversing ships 26 meters 
above sea level. Operating this lock system would require
a massive reservoir of water. And fortunately, the low-lying Chagres 
river valley provided a natural solution. By building a dam across the gap 
where the river flowed out to sea, the entire valley could be flooded. At 32 meters high 
and over 800 meters wide, the Gatun Dam would be larger 
than any built before. With this innovative plan, the Americans didn’t need to excavate
the entire mountain, but rather, just the pathway
for the canal itself. Still, the work was staggering. Even after progress made by the French,
it took over nine years for 24,000 workers to blow up, shovel, 
and drill out the Culebra Cut— a roughly 14 kilometer passageway 
through the Continental Divide. The railway, now upgraded and rerouted
to follow the canal, carted away over 76 million cubic meters
of excavated rock to be used at the Gatun Dam site. Construction was only half the battle. Leading army officials struggled 
to maintain infrastructure and sanitation, but accidents and diseases took
the lives of 5,000 workers— mostly Black Caribbean migrants. Then, in the fall of 1913,
the moment finally came. A telegraph signal from President Woodrow
Wilson triggered a dike explosion, flooding the Culebra Cut and joining 
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Today, nearly 14,000 vessels travel
through the isthmus annually— each in under 12 hours. The canal remains Panama’s 
chief source of revenue; and since the country gained ownership
of the passage in 1999, it has also become a source
of national pride.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the only sea passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans before the canal, while the generated MCQs cover various topics related to the Panama Canal, but not this specific question.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of sea passages and geographical locations, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, but still not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that specifically target the topic of sea passages and geographical locations, and then try to match them with the ground truth MCQ.

In this case, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new set of MCQs should be generated to try to find a match.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In the middle of the 19th century, the California gold rush brought thousands
of settlers to America’s west coast. But finding gold may have been easier 
than transporting it back east. The only hope for avoiding 
a grueling six month wagon journey was to travel the narrowest portion 
of the continent— the 48-kilometer Isthmus of Panama. By 1855, a railroad spanning the region
significantly shortened to the trip, but unloading and reloading ships
at each port cost time and money. To truly connect these two bodies of water
shipping interests needed a canal— a continuous maritime passage
through the isthmus. The first attempt at this colossal
construction project was taken up in 1881 by French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps. De Lesseps had supervised construction
of Egypt's Suez Canal, but his success made him overconfident. He insisted on digging the canal 
at sea level, even though it required boring 
directly through the Continental Divide mountain range. Futile excavation efforts were buried
under constant landslides. And since the diplomat had only 
visited the site briefly during Panama’s dry season, his workers were unprepared for 
torrential storms, venomous jungle fauna, and tropical diseases. After spending $287 million 
and losing a staggering 22,000 lives, the French abandoned the project. The United States had been considering

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the Continental Divide, the most similar generated MCQ is:

Question 9: What was the name of the passageway through the Continental Divide that was excavated by the workers? Options: A. Culebra Cut, B. Gatun Cut, C. Panama Pass, D. Isthmus Tunnel

Although this question does not directly ask about the definition of the Continental Divide, it mentions the Continental Divide and is related to its geographical context. 

However, if I had to choose a question that could potentially provide a similar answer to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

Question 4: What was the main reason for the failure of the French attempt to build the Panama Canal? Options: A. The lack of funding, B. The difficulty of excavating through the Continental Divide, C. The constant landslides and tropical diseases, D. The opposition from the Panamanian government

This question mentions the Continental Divide as a potential reason for the failure of the French attempt to build the Panama Canal. If the correct answer were B, it could imply that the Continental Divide is a geographical obstacle, which could be inferred to be a mountainous region.

However, please note that neither of these questions directly matches the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that directly asks about the definition of the Continental Divide would be more suitable.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the other location that the US considered for the canal. The transcript mentions that "The United States had been considering building a canal through Nicaragua..."

While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 2 mentions the difficulty of transporting gold from the west coast to the east coast, which is somewhat related to the context of the ground truth MCQ. However, it doesn't specifically ask about the alternative location considered by the US.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar enough to be considered a match. But if I had to pick one, I would say Question 2, but with a very low confidence level.

However, I must emphasize that the correct answer is not among the generated MCQs. A new MCQ should be generated to match the ground truth MCQ.

Here is an example of a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ:

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the causes of worker deaths during the construction of the Panama Canal. Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 is about the number of workers who lost their lives during the construction of the Panama Canal. Although it does not match the ground truth MCQ exactly, it is the closest one in terms of topic.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that could be modified to match the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 4. It is about the main reason for the failure of the French attempt to build the Panama Canal, which mentions tropical diseases as one of the options. This could be modified to ask about the causes of worker deaths, which would make it similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly, I would not recommend any of them as a direct match.

In the middle of the 19th century, the California gold rush brought thousands
of settlers to America’s west coast. But finding gold may have been easier 
than transporting it back east. The only hope for avoiding 
a grueling six month wagon journey was to travel the narrowest portion 
of the continent— the 48-kilometer Isthmus of Panama. By 1855, a railroad spanning the region
significantly shortened to the trip, but unloading and reloading ships
at each port cost time and money. To truly connect these two bodies of water
shipping interests needed a canal— a continuous maritime passage
through the isthmus. The first attempt at this colossal
construction project was taken up in 1881 by French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps. De Lesseps had supervised construction
of Egypt's Suez Canal, but his success made him overconfident. He insisted on digging the canal 
at sea level, even though it required boring 
directly through the Continental Divide mountain range. Futile excavation efforts were buried
under constant landslides. And since the diplomat had only 
visited the site briefly during Panama’s dry season, his workers were unprepared for 
torrential storms, venomous jungle fauna, and tropical diseases. After spending $287 million 
and losing a staggering 22,000 lives, the French abandoned the project. The United States had been considering
building a canal through Nicaragua, but at this point, the chance to succeed
where France failed was tempting. Panamanian leaders were also eager 
to complete a canal which would bring their country
business and prestige. However, Panama was still a part
of Colombia at the time, and the country was stalling negotiations
with the U.S. Sensing an opportunity, President Teddy Roosevelt 
went straight to the Panamanians. With encouragement and military support 
from the U.S., Panama launched a coup in 1903. Within days, they became 
an independent nation and signed a treaty to begin 
construction of the canal. Just over a decade after the French left,
the Americans were ready to dig in— and they were determined to avoid
their predecessor’s mistakes. Instead of cutting the mountain
down to sea level, they would raise the sea up the mountain. The plan was to build massive steel gates separating the canal into multiple
chambers with different water levels. As a ship passed through each 
successive gate would open, lowering the water level 
in the next chamber, while raising the ship 
and allowing it to move on. The design called for five 
of these so-called canal locks— three on the Atlantic side
and two on the Pacific, raising traversing ships 26 meters 
above sea level. Operating this lock system would require
a massive reservoir of water. And fortunately, the low-lying Chagres 
river valley provided a natural solution. By building a dam across the gap 
where the river flowed out to sea, the entire valley could be flooded. At 32 meters high 
and over 800 meters wide, the Gatun Dam would be larger 
than any built before. With this innovative plan, the Americans didn’t need to excavate
the entire mountain, but rather, just the pathway
for the canal itself. Still, the work was staggering. Even after progress made by the French,
it took over nine years for 24,000 workers to blow up, shovel, 
and drill out the Culebra Cut— a roughly 14 kilometer passageway 
through the Continental Divide. The railway, now upgraded and rerouted
to follow the canal, carted away over 76 million cubic meters
of excavated rock to be used at the Gatun Dam site. Construction was only half the battle. Leading army officials struggled 
to maintain infrastructure and sanitation, but accidents and diseases took
the lives of 5,000 workers— mostly Black Caribbean migrants. Then, in the fall of 1913,
the moment finally came. A telegraph signal from President Woodrow
Wilson triggered a dike explosion, flooding the Culebra Cut and joining 
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Today, nearly 14,000 vessels travel
through the isthmus annually— each in under 12 hours. The canal remains Panama’s 
chief source of revenue; and since the country gained ownership
of the passage in 1999, it has also become a source
of national pride.

**Transcript**:
By the end of the 20th century, the race to build the world's tallest
skyscraper grinded to a halt. Each new contender was only slightly
taller than the one before, and architects were running out of ways
to top their previous efforts. But in 2004 construction began
on a new building in Dubai, promising a revolutionary design 
that would dwarf the competition. In 2009, the 828-meter Burj Khalifa 
was complete, surpassing the previous 
record-holder by over 60%. So what innovations allowed 
for such a huge leap in height? For most of architectural history,
heavy building materials made it difficult for tall buildings 
to support their own weight. To compensate, taller structures had 
wider, thicker masonry at the base, making them substantially more expensive. The arrival of industrial steel 
in the early 20th century helped buildings shed weight, 
and stretch to new heights. But steel frames required intensive
labor to produce, often under poor working conditions. And when they were finished, these three dimensional grids took up huge
amounts of space inside buildings. Tall steel skyscrapers also had 
larger, less dense surfaces, making them vulnerable to strong winds. Architects designed various 
countermeasures to prevent swaying and structural damage, but to increase height further, engineers would have to completely rethink
how tall buildings were designed. Enter the father of modern skyscrapers:
Fazlur Rahman Khan. This Bangladeshi-American engineer
believed tall structures should bear their weight where they were 
widest and most stable— on the outside. He proposed swapping an internal grid 
of steel beams for a steel and concrete exoskeleton that would make buildings
more resilient to wind while using far less heavy materials. Khan developed this idea into what
he called tubular designs. These buildings had exterior steel frames
that were braced with concrete and connected to horizontal floor beams. Tubular frames proved superior
at absorbing and transferring the force of wind to a building's
foundation. And since the exterior walls could
bear the bulk of the load, internal supporting columns could
be removed to maximize space. Following the 1960s, tubular design
became the industry standard. This new philosophy allowed 
for the construction of taller, sturdier skyscrapers, including many of the record holders 
for world’s tallest building. But planning the Burj Khalifa would
take one more innovation. In 2004, the late Fazlur Khan’s 
longtime employers, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, completed 
the Tower Palace III in South Korea. This building took Khan's exoskeleton
design one step further, with a central column supported
by three protruding wings. Each wing’s weight carries the other two, while the heavy concrete core acts 
as a support beam, that also houses the building’s elevators 
and mechanical infrastructure. This design, called the buttressed core, allowed the entire structure to work 
as a single load-bearing unit, supporting the building’s 73 stories. SOM was confident the buttressed core
could support a much taller building, and they were determined to see how high
they could go with their next project. As only the second building
to use this design, the Burj Khalifa spans 
an unprecedented 163 floors. To battle the monumental 
vertical and lateral forces, the design strategically places 
the strongest, load-bearing areas where the wind is also most powerful. Additionally, the Y-shaped layout 
was specifically calibrated to minimize local wind forces. Every several floors, 
one of the wings recedes slightly, forming a series of setbacks
in a clockwise pattern. This spiral shape disperses air currents, transforming 240 kilometer per hour
winds into harmless gusts. Considering its height and unique design, the Burj Khalifa was completed 
in a staggeringly short five year period. However, this pace came
at a great human cost. The workforce consisted mostly 
of South Asian migrants, who regularly endured shifts 
over 12 hours long for a daily wage of roughly $10. Those who tried to quit or return home 
had their paychecks and passports withheld by the project’s construction company. These abusive conditions led
to multiple protests, in addition to at least one suicide, 
and one fatal accident reported on site. In the years following 
the tower’s completion, the United Arab Emirates fell
under harsh scrutiny for failing to enforce worker
protection laws. Hopefully, future projects
will prioritize the individuals behind these engineering marvels 
over the buildings themselves.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would select Question 4: "What design concept did Fazlur Rahman Khan propose to make buildings more resilient to wind while using fewer heavy materials?" This question is related to the tube structural design, but it does not mention the plant that inspired it.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be 4, but please note that it is not a close match.

It would be better to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ, or to modify the existing generated MCQs to better match the question intent, options, and content of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
By the end of the 20th century, the race to build the world's tallest
skyscraper grinded to a halt. Each new contender was only slightly
taller than the one before, and architects were running out of ways
to top their previous efforts. But in 2004 construction began
on a new building in Dubai, promising a revolutionary design 
that would dwarf the competition. In 2009, the 828-meter Burj Khalifa 
was complete, surpassing the previous 
record-holder by over 60%. So what innovations allowed 
for such a huge leap in height? For most of architectural history,
heavy building materials made it difficult for tall buildings 
to support their own weight. To compensate, taller structures had 
wider, thicker masonry at the base, making them substantially more expensive. The arrival of industrial steel 
in the early 20th century helped buildings shed weight, 
and stretch to new heights. But steel frames required intensive
labor to produce, often under poor working conditions. And when they were finished, these three dimensional grids took up huge
amounts of space inside buildings. Tall steel skyscrapers also had 
larger, less dense surfaces, making them vulnerable to strong winds. Architects designed various 
countermeasures to prevent swaying and structural damage, but to increase height further, engineers would have to completely rethink
how tall buildings were designed. Enter the father of modern skyscrapers:
Fazlur Rahman Khan. This Bangladeshi-American engineer
believed tall structures should bear their weight where they were 
widest and most stable— on the outside. He proposed swapping an internal grid 
of steel beams for a steel and concrete exoskeleton that would make buildings
more resilient to wind while using far less heavy materials. Khan developed this idea into what
he called tubular designs. These buildings had exterior steel frames
that were braced with concrete and connected to horizontal floor beams. Tubular frames proved superior
at absorbing and transferring the force of wind to a building's
foundation. And since the exterior walls could
bear the bulk of the load, internal supporting columns could
be removed to maximize space. Following the 1960s, tubular design
became the industry standard. This new philosophy allowed 
for the construction of taller, sturdier skyscrapers, including many of the record holders 
for world’s tallest building. But planning the Burj Khalifa would
take one more innovation. In 2004, the late Fazlur Khan’s 
longtime employers, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, completed 
the Tower Palace III in South Korea. This building took Khan's exoskeleton
design one step further, with a central column supported
by three protruding wings. Each wing’s weight carries the other two, while the heavy concrete core acts 
as a support beam, that also houses the building’s elevators 
and mechanical infrastructure. This design, called the buttressed core, allowed the entire structure to work 
as a single load-bearing unit, supporting the building’s 73 stories. SOM was confident the buttressed core
could support a much taller building, and they were determined to see how high
they could go with their next project. As only the second building
to use this design, the Burj Khalifa spans 
an unprecedented 163 floors. To battle the monumental 
vertical and lateral forces, the design strategically places 
the strongest, load-bearing areas where the wind is also most powerful. Additionally, the Y-shaped layout 
was specifically calibrated to minimize local wind forces. Every several floors, 
one of the wings recedes slightly, forming a series of setbacks
in a clockwise pattern. This spiral shape disperses air currents, transforming 240 kilometer per hour
winds into harmless gusts. Considering its height and unique design, the Burj Khalifa was completed 
in a staggeringly short five year period. However, this pace came
at a great human cost. The workforce consisted mostly 
of South Asian migrants, who regularly endured shifts 
over 12 hours long for a daily wage of roughly $10. Those who tried to quit or return home 
had their paychecks and passports withheld by the project’s construction company. These abusive conditions led
to multiple protests, in addition to at least one suicide, 
and one fatal accident reported on site. In the years following 
the tower’s completion, the United Arab Emirates fell
under harsh scrutiny for failing to enforce worker
protection laws. Hopefully, future projects
will prioritize the individuals behind these engineering marvels 
over the buildings themselves.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

This question is about the treatment of workers on the Burj Khalifa project, specifically their wages, which is related to the ground truth MCQ about the origin of the workforce. Although the questions are not identical, they both deal with the topic of labor on the Burj Khalifa project.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to focus more on the architectural and engineering aspects of the Burj Khalifa, whereas the ground truth MCQ is more focused on the social aspect of the project.

If I had to choose the most similar question based on the content, I would say that Question 9 is the closest match, but it's still not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Socrates, one of the founding fathers
of Western philosophical thought, was on trial. Many Athenians believed 
he was a dangerous enemy of the state, accusing the philosopher
of corrupting the youth and refusing to recognize their gods. However, Socrates wasn’t feared 
for claiming to have all the answers, but rather, for asking too many questions. While he loathed formal lectures, the philosopher frequently
engaged friends and strangers in lengthy conversations
about morality and society. These discussions weren’t debates,
nor would Socrates offer explicit advice. In fact, the philosopher often claimed
to know nothing at all, responding to his partner's answers
only with further questions. But through this process, 
Socrates probed their logic, revealing its flaws and helping both
parties reach a more robust understanding. These insightful questions made Socrates
beloved by his followers. Two of his students, Plato and Xenophon,
were so inspired that they replicated their mentor’s 
process in fictional dialogues. These invented exchanges
provide perfect examples of what would come to be known 
as the Socratic Method. In one of these fabricated dialogues, Socrates is conversing with 
a young man named Euthydemus, who is confident that he understands 
the nature of justice and injustice. Socrates probes the student’s values
by asking him to label actions such as lying and theft 
as just or unjust. Euthydemus confidently categorizes
them as injustices, but this only prompts another question: is it just for a general to deceive
or pillage a hostile army? Euthydemus revises his assertion. He claims that these actions 
are just when done to enemies, and unjust when done to friends. But Socrates isn’t finished. He asks the young man to consider 
a commander lying to his troops to boost their morale. Before long, Euthydemus is despondent. It seems that every answer
leads to further problems, and perhaps he’s not quite sure
what constitutes justice after all. In employing this
question-oriented approach, Socrates described himself as a midwife, whose inquiries assist others
in giving birth to their ideas. His method of questioning draws out an
individual’s unexamined assumptions, and then challenges those biases. It doesn't always provide
definitive answers, but the method helps clarify the questions and eliminate contradictory 
or circular logic. And by following a line of inquiry 
where it logically leads, both the question asker and answerer
can end up in unexpected places. This technique isn’t limited 
by the conversation’s content, making it incredibly useful
in numerous fields. During the Renaissance, the method was
used to teach clinical medicine. Students proposed their rationale
for different diagnoses, while a doctor questioned their
assumptions and moderated discussion. In this model, the method could even
produce conclusive results. This same approach was later used
in other sciences, such as astronomy, botany, 
and mathematics. Following the Protestant Reformation, it was adapted to tackle abstract
questions of faith. In the 19th century, the method 
became an essential part of American legal education. Professors explored students’ 
understanding of judicial reasoning by challenging them with unforeseen
hypothetical situations. This approach is still used today
by the Supreme Court to imagine the unintended impacts 
of passing a law. The Socratic Method can be adapted 
to teach almost any topic that relies on critical reasoning, but its success depends on the teacher 
employing it. An effective Socratic educator 
must be well versed in their subject. Rather than bullying their students
or showing off their superior intellect, they should be modest, genuinely curious, 
and affirming of every contribution. In this regard, Socrates himself may not have been 
the most subtle Socratic teacher. Historians believe he was deeply critical
of Athens’ particular brand of democracy, and known to pass those concerns
onto his followers. These subversive beliefs were
distorted in public forums and thought to have inspired 
two of his pupils to treasonous ends. It was likely for these ideas
Socrates was brought to trial, and eventually, 
sentenced to death. But even on his deathbed, artists depict
a serene philosopher— ever curious to explore 
the ultimate question.

**Transcript**:
Socrates, one of the founding fathers
of Western philosophical thought, was on trial. Many Athenians believed 
he was a dangerous enemy of the state, accusing the philosopher
of corrupting the youth and refusing to recognize their gods. However, Socrates wasn’t feared 
for claiming to have all the answers, but rather, for asking too many questions. While he loathed formal lectures, the philosopher frequently
engaged friends and strangers in lengthy conversations
about morality and society. These discussions weren’t debates,
nor would Socrates offer explicit advice. In fact, the philosopher often claimed
to know nothing at all, responding to his partner's answers
only with further questions. But through this process, 
Socrates probed their logic, revealing its flaws and helping both
parties reach a more robust understanding. These insightful questions made Socrates
beloved by his followers. Two of his students, Plato and Xenophon,
were so inspired that they replicated their mentor’s 
process in fictional dialogues. These invented exchanges
provide perfect examples of what would come to be known 
as the Socratic Method. In one of these fabricated dialogues, Socrates is conversing with 
a young man named Euthydemus, who is confident that he understands 
the nature of justice and injustice. Socrates probes the student’s values
by asking him to label actions such as lying and theft 
as just or unjust. Euthydemus confidently categorizes
them as injustices, but this only prompts another question: is it just for a general to deceive
or pillage a hostile army? Euthydemus revises his assertion. He claims that these actions 
are just when done to enemies, and unjust when done to friends. But Socrates isn’t finished. He asks the young man to consider 
a commander lying to his troops to boost their morale. Before long, Euthydemus is despondent. It seems that every answer
leads to further problems, and perhaps he’s not quite sure
what constitutes justice after all. In employing this
question-oriented approach, Socrates described himself as a midwife, whose inquiries assist others
in giving birth to their ideas. His method of questioning draws out an
individual’s unexamined assumptions, and then challenges those biases. It doesn't always provide
definitive answers, but the method helps clarify the questions and eliminate contradictory 
or circular logic. And by following a line of inquiry 
where it logically leads, both the question asker and answerer
can end up in unexpected places. This technique isn’t limited 
by the conversation’s content, making it incredibly useful
in numerous fields. During the Renaissance, the method was
used to teach clinical medicine. Students proposed their rationale
for different diagnoses, while a doctor questioned their
assumptions and moderated discussion. In this model, the method could even
produce conclusive results. This same approach was later used
in other sciences, such as astronomy, botany, 
and mathematics. Following the Protestant Reformation, it was adapted to tackle abstract
questions of faith. In the 19th century, the method 
became an essential part of American legal education. Professors explored students’ 
understanding of judicial reasoning by challenging them with unforeseen
hypothetical situations. This approach is still used today
by the Supreme Court to imagine the unintended impacts 
of passing a law. The Socratic Method can be adapted 
to teach almost any topic that relies on critical reasoning, but its success depends on the teacher 
employing it. An effective Socratic educator 
must be well versed in their subject. Rather than bullying their students
or showing off their superior intellect, they should be modest, genuinely curious, 
and affirming of every contribution. In this regard, Socrates himself may not have been 
the most subtle Socratic teacher. Historians believe he was deeply critical
of Athens’ particular brand of democracy, and known to pass those concerns
onto his followers. These subversive beliefs were
distorted in public forums and thought to have inspired 
two of his pupils to treasonous ends. It was likely for these ideas
Socrates was brought to trial, and eventually, 
sentenced to death. But even on his deathbed, artists depict
a serene philosopher— ever curious to explore 
the ultimate question.

**Transcript**:
It’s 1481. In the city of Seville, devout Catholics are turning themselves 
in to the authorities. They’re confessing to heresy— failure to
follow the beliefs of the Catholic Church. But why? The Spanish Inquisition
has arrived in Seville. The Inquisition began in 1478, 
when Pope Sixtus IV issued a decree authorizing the Catholic monarchs, 
Ferdinand and Isabella, to root out heresy
in the Spanish kingdoms— a confederacy of semi-independent kingdoms in the area that would become
the modern country of Spain. Though the order came from the church,
the monarchs had requested it. When the Inquisition began, 
the Spanish kingdoms were diverse both ethnically and religiously, with Jews, Muslims, and Christians living
in the same regions. The Inquisition quickly turned
its attention to ridding the region of people who were not
part of the Catholic Church. It would last more than 350 years. On the ground, groups called tribunals ran
the Inquisition in each region. Roles on a tribunal could include an arresting constable, 
a prosecuting attorney, inquisitors to question the accused,
and a scribe. A “Grand Inquisitor,” a member of the 
clergy selected by the king and queen, almost always led a tribunal. The Inquisition marked its arrival in each
new place with an “Edict of Grace.” Typically lasting 40 days, the Edict of Grace promised mercy
to those who confess to heresy. After that, the inquisitors persecuted
suspected heretics on the basis of anonymous accusations. So the confessors in Seville probably
didn’t see themselves as actual heretics— instead, they were hedging their bets
by reporting themselves when the consequences were low, rather than risking 
imprisonment or torture if someone else accused them later on. They were right to worry: once the authorities arrested someone, 
accusations were often vague, so the accused didn’t know the reasons 
for their arrest or the identity of their accuser. Victims were imprisoned 
for months or even years. Once arrested, 
their property was confiscated, often leaving their families
on the street. Under these conditions, victims confessed
to the most mundane forms of heresy— like hanging linen to dry on a Saturday. The Inquisition targeted different subsets
of the population over time. In 1492, at the brutal Grand Inquisitor
Tomás de Torquemada’s urging, the monarchs issued a decree giving 
Spanish Jews four months to either convert to Christianity
or leave the kingdom. Thousands were expelled 
and those who stayed risked persecution. Converts to Christianity,
known as conversos, weren’t even safe, because authorities suspected 
them of practicing Judaism in secret. The hatred directed at conversos
was both religious and economic, as conversos made up a large portion
of the upper middle class. The Inquisition eventually
shifted its focus to the moriscos, converts to Christianity from Islam. In 1609, an edict passed forcing
all moriscos to leave. An estimated 300,000 left. Those who remained became 
the Inquisition’s next targets. The inquisitors announced the punishments
of those found guilty of heresy in public gatherings called autos de fé,
or acts of faith. Hundreds of people gathered to watch 
the procession of sinners, mass, sermon, and finally the announcement
of punishments. Most of the accused received punishments
like imprisonment, exile, or having to wear a sanbenito, 
a garment that marked them as a sinner. The worst punishment 
was “relaxado en persona”— a euphemism for burning at the stake. This punishment was relatively uncommon— reserved for unrepentant
and relapsed heretics. Over 350 years after Queen Isabella
started the Inquisition, her namesake, Queen Isabella II, 
formally ended it on July 15th, 1834. The Spanish kingdoms’ dependence 
on the Catholic Church had isolated them while the rest of Europe
experienced the Enlightenment and embraced the separation 
of church and state. Historians still debate the number 
of people killed during the Inquisition. Some suggest over 30,000 
but most estimate between 1,000 and 2,000. The consequences of the Inquisition,
however, reach far beyond fatalities. In some places, an estimated 1/3
of prisoners were tortured. Hundreds of thousands of members 
of religious minorities were forced to leave their homes, and those who remained faced 
discrimination and economic hardship. Smaller inquisitions in Spanish 
colonial territories in the Americas, especially Mexico,
carried their own tolls. Friends turned in friends, 
neighbors accused neighbors, and even family members reported
each other of heresy. Under the Inquisition, people were condemned to live 
in fear and paranoia for centuries.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the year the Spanish Inquisition began, while Question 2 asks about who issued a decree authorizing the Catholic monarchs to root out heresy in the Spanish kingdoms. Although the questions are not identical, they are related to the same event, and the correct answer to Question 2 (Pope Sixtus IV) is mentioned in the same context as the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ (1478).

However, a more relevant question would be one that directly asks about the year the Spanish Inquisition began. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose:

None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the closest related question:

 Question 2 is not an exact match but is the closest in terms of context.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQs or to modify the existing MCQs to better align with the ground truth MCQs.

**Transcript**:
It’s 1481. In the city of Seville, devout Catholics are turning themselves 
in to the authorities. They’re confessing to heresy— failure to
follow the beliefs of the Catholic Church. But why? The Spanish Inquisition
has arrived in Seville. The Inquisition began in 1478, 
when Pope Sixtus IV issued a decree authorizing the Catholic monarchs, 
Ferdinand and Isabella, to root out heresy
in the Spanish kingdoms— a confederacy of semi-independent kingdoms in the area that would become
the modern country of Spain. Though the order came from the church,
the monarchs had requested it. When the Inquisition began, 
the Spanish kingdoms were diverse both ethnically and religiously, with Jews, Muslims, and Christians living
in the same regions. The Inquisition quickly turned
its attention to ridding the region of people who were not
part of the Catholic Church. It would last more than 350 years. On the ground, groups called tribunals ran
the Inquisition in each region. Roles on a tribunal could include an arresting constable, 
a prosecuting attorney, inquisitors to question the accused,
and a scribe. A “Grand Inquisitor,” a member of the 
clergy selected by the king and queen, almost always led a tribunal. The Inquisition marked its arrival in each
new place with an “Edict of Grace.” Typically lasting 40 days, the Edict of Grace promised mercy
to those who confess to heresy. After that, the inquisitors persecuted
suspected heretics on the basis of anonymous accusations. So the confessors in Seville probably
didn’t see themselves as actual heretics— instead, they were hedging their bets
by reporting themselves when the consequences were low, rather than risking 
imprisonment or torture if someone else accused them later on. They were right to worry: once the authorities arrested someone, 
accusations were often vague, so the accused didn’t know the reasons 
for their arrest or the identity of their accuser. Victims were imprisoned 
for months or even years. Once arrested, 
their property was confiscated, often leaving their families
on the street. Under these conditions, victims confessed
to the most mundane forms of heresy— like hanging linen to dry on a Saturday. The Inquisition targeted different subsets
of the population over time. In 1492, at the brutal Grand Inquisitor
Tomás de Torquemada’s urging, the monarchs issued a decree giving 
Spanish Jews four months to either convert to Christianity
or leave the kingdom. Thousands were expelled 
and those who stayed risked persecution. Converts to Christianity,
known as conversos, weren’t even safe, because authorities suspected 
them of practicing Judaism in secret. The hatred directed at conversos
was both religious and economic, as conversos made up a large portion
of the upper middle class. The Inquisition eventually
shifted its focus to the moriscos, converts to Christianity from Islam. In 1609, an edict passed forcing
all moriscos to leave. An estimated 300,000 left. Those who remained became 
the Inquisition’s next targets. The inquisitors announced the punishments
of those found guilty of heresy in public gatherings called autos de fé,
or acts of faith. Hundreds of people gathered to watch 
the procession of sinners, mass, sermon, and finally the announcement
of punishments. Most of the accused received punishments
like imprisonment, exile, or having to wear a sanbenito, 
a garment that marked them as a sinner. The worst punishment 
was “relaxado en persona”— a euphemism for burning at the stake. This punishment was relatively uncommon— reserved for unrepentant
and relapsed heretics. Over 350 years after Queen Isabella
started the Inquisition, her namesake, Queen Isabella II, 
formally ended it on July 15th, 1834. The Spanish kingdoms’ dependence 
on the Catholic Church had isolated them while the rest of Europe
experienced the Enlightenment and embraced the separation 
of church and state. Historians still debate the number 
of people killed during the Inquisition. Some suggest over 30,000 
but most estimate between 1,000 and 2,000. The consequences of the Inquisition,
however, reach far beyond fatalities. In some places, an estimated 1/3
of prisoners were tortured. Hundreds of thousands of members 
of religious minorities were forced to leave their homes, and those who remained faced 
discrimination and economic hardship. Smaller inquisitions in Spanish 
colonial territories in the Americas, especially Mexico,
carried their own tolls. Friends turned in friends, 
neighbors accused neighbors, and even family members reported
each other of heresy. Under the Inquisition, people were condemned to live 
in fear and paranoia for centuries.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the diversity of the Spanish Kingdoms in the late 1400s, specifically which religion was not practiced by residents. The generated MCQs do not directly address this question.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2: "Who issued a decree authorizing the Catholic monarchs to root out heresy in the Spanish kingdoms?" This question is related to the context of the Spanish Inquisition and the Catholic Church's role in it, which is also mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

But, since the question intent, options, and content do not match, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ.

If you would like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it asks about a specific punishment related to the Inquisition, and one of the options (A. Burning at the stake) matches the correct answer of the ground truth MCQ ("relaxado en persona" means to be burned at the stake).

However, it's worth noting that the question intent is not an exact match, as the ground truth MCQ asks about the meaning of a specific term, while the generated MCQ asks about a typical punishment. Nevertheless, among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

shifted its focus to the moriscos, converts to Christianity from Islam. In 1609, an edict passed forcing
all moriscos to leave. An estimated 300,000 left. Those who remained became 
the Inquisition’s next targets. The inquisitors announced the punishments
of those found guilty of heresy in public gatherings called autos de fé,
or acts of faith. Hundreds of people gathered to watch 
the procession of sinners, mass, sermon, and finally the announcement
of punishments. Most of the accused received punishments
like imprisonment, exile, or having to wear a sanbenito, 
a garment that marked them as a sinner. The worst punishment 
was “relaxado en persona”— a euphemism for burning at the stake. This punishment was relatively uncommon— reserved for unrepentant
and relapsed heretics. Over 350 years after Queen Isabella
started the Inquisition, her namesake, Queen Isabella II, 
formally ended it on July 15th, 1834. The Spanish kingdoms’ dependence 
on the Catholic Church had isolated them while the rest of Europe
experienced the Enlightenment and embraced the separation 
of church and state. Historians still debate the number 
of people killed during the Inquisition. Some suggest over 30,000 
but most estimate between 1,000 and 2,000. The consequences of the Inquisition,
however, reach far beyond fatalities. In some places, an estimated 1/3
of prisoners were tortured. Hundreds of thousands of members 
of religious minorities were forced to leave their homes, and those who remained faced 
discrimination and economic hardship. Smaller inquisitions in Spanish 
colonial territories in the Americas, especially Mexico,
carried their own tolls. Friends turned in friends, 
neighbors accused neighbors, and even family members reported
each other of heresy. Under the Inquisition, people were condemned to live 
in fear and paranoia for centuries.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 9: What was the name of the queen who formally ended the Inquisition in 1834? Options: A. Queen Isabella I, B. Queen Isabella II, C. Queen Elizabeth I, D. Queen Catherine I**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the most similar in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the year the Spanish Inquisition officially ended, while Question 9 asks about the queen who formally ended the Inquisition in 1834, which is the same year mentioned in the correct option of the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more similar question would be one that asks about the year the Inquisition ended, rather than the queen who ended it. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **9**

Please note that this is not an exact match, but rather the most similar question based on the provided options.

**Transcript**:
Today, artificial intelligence helps
doctors diagnose patients, pilots fly commercial aircraft, 
and city planners predict traffic. But no matter what these AIs are doing,
the computer scientists who designed them likely don’t know exactly 
how they’re doing it. This is because artificial intelligence 
is often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique array 
of rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? There are many different ways 
to build self-teaching programs. But they all rely on the three 
basic types of machine learning: unsupervised learning, supervised 
learning, and reinforcement learning. To see these in action, let’s imagine researchers are trying
to pull information from a set of medical data containing
thousands of patient profiles. First up, unsupervised learning. This approach would be ideal
for analyzing all the profiles to find general similarities
and useful patterns. Maybe certain patients have similar
disease presentations, or perhaps a treatment produces
specific sets of side effects. This broad pattern-seeking approach 
can be used to identify similarities between patient profiles 
and find emerging patterns, all without human guidance. But let's imagine doctors are looking
for something more specific. These physicians want 
to create an algorithm for diagnosing a particular condition. They begin by collecting two sets of data— medical images and test results
from both healthy patients and those diagnosed with the condition. Then, they input this data into a program designed to identify features
shared by the sick patients but not the healthy patients. Based on how frequently 
it sees certain features, the program will assign values to those
features’ diagnostic significance, generating an algorithm 
for diagnosing future patients. However, unlike unsupervised learning, doctors and computer scientists have 
an active role in what happens next. Doctors will make the final diagnosis and check the accuracy 
of the algorithm’s prediction. Then computer scientists can use
the updated datasets to adjust the program’s parameters 
and improve its accuracy. This hands-on approach is called
supervised learning. Now, let’s say these doctors want 
to design another algorithm to recommend treatment plans. Since these plans
will be implemented in stages, and they may change depending on each
individual's response to treatments, the doctors decide to use
reinforcement learning. This program uses an iterative approach
to gather feedback about which medications, dosages 
and treatments are most effective. Then, it compares that data 
against each patient’s profile to create their unique, optimal 
treatment plan. As the treatments progress and the program
receives more feedback, it can constantly update 
the plan for each patient. None of these three techniques are
inherently smarter than any other. While some require more or less 
human intervention, they all have their own strengths
and weaknesses which makes them best suited
for certain tasks. However, by using them together, researchers can build complex AI systems, where individual programs can 
supervise and teach each other. For example, 
when our unsupervised learning program finds groups of patients that are similar, it could send that data to a connected 
supervised learning program. That program could then incorporate 
this information into its predictions. Or perhaps dozens of reinforcement
learning programs might simulate potential patient outcomes to collect feedback 
about different treatment plans. There are numerous ways to create
these machine-learning systems, and perhaps the most promising models are those that mimic the relationship 
between neurons in the brain. These artificial neural networks can use
millions of connections to tackle difficult tasks like 
image recognition, speech recognition, and even language translation. However, the more self-directed
these models become, the harder it is for computer scientists to determine how these self-taught 
algorithms arrive at their solution. Researchers are already looking at ways 
to make machine learning more transparent. But as AI becomes more involved
in our everyday lives, these enigmatic decisions have
increasingly large impacts on our work, health, and safety. So as machines continue learning 
to investigate, negotiate and communicate, we must also consider how to teach them 
to teach each other to operate ethically.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not directly ask how supervised machine learning figures out what rules to follow to do a task, it does describe the role of doctors in supervised learning, which involves making the final diagnosis and checking the accuracy of the algorithm's prediction. This process is closely related to how supervised machine learning learns the rules to follow, as it involves human intervention and guidance.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs seem to focus more on the characteristics and applications of different machine learning types, whereas the ground truth MCQ focuses on how supervised machine learning learns the rules to follow.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 3, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

to create an algorithm for diagnosing a particular condition. They begin by collecting two sets of data— medical images and test results
from both healthy patients and those diagnosed with the condition. Then, they input this data into a program designed to identify features
shared by the sick patients but not the healthy patients. Based on how frequently 
it sees certain features, the program will assign values to those
features’ diagnostic significance, generating an algorithm 
for diagnosing future patients. However, unlike unsupervised learning, doctors and computer scientists have 
an active role in what happens next. Doctors will make the final diagnosis and check the accuracy 
of the algorithm’s prediction. Then computer scientists can use
the updated datasets to adjust the program’s parameters 
and improve its accuracy. This hands-on approach is called
supervised learning. Now, let’s say these doctors want 
to design another algorithm to recommend treatment plans. Since these plans
will be implemented in stages, and they may change depending on each
individual's response to treatments, the doctors decide to use
reinforcement learning. This program uses an iterative approach
to gather feedback about which medications, dosages 
and treatments are most effective. Then, it compares that data 
against each patient’s profile to create their unique, optimal 
treatment plan. As the treatments progress and the program
receives more feedback, it can constantly update 
the plan for each patient. None of these three techniques are
inherently smarter than any other. While some require more or less 
human intervention, they all have their own strengths
and weaknesses which makes them best suited
for certain tasks. However, by using them together, researchers can build complex AI systems, where individual programs can 
supervise and teach each other. For example, 
when our unsupervised learning program finds groups of patients that are similar, it could send that data to a connected 
supervised learning program. That program could then incorporate 
this information into its predictions. Or perhaps dozens of reinforcement
learning programs might simulate potential patient outcomes to collect feedback 
about different treatment plans. There are numerous ways to create
these machine-learning systems, and perhaps the most promising models are those that mimic the relationship 
between neurons in the brain. These artificial neural networks can use
millions of connections to tackle difficult tasks like 
image recognition, speech recognition, and even language translation. However, the more self-directed
these models become, the harder it is for computer scientists to determine how these self-taught 
algorithms arrive at their solution. Researchers are already looking at ways 
to make machine learning more transparent. But as AI becomes more involved
in our everyday lives, these enigmatic decisions have
increasingly large impacts on our work, health, and safety. So as machines continue learning 
to investigate, negotiate and communicate, we must also consider how to teach them 
to teach each other to operate ethically.

**Transcript**:
Today, artificial intelligence helps
doctors diagnose patients, pilots fly commercial aircraft, 
and city planners predict traffic. But no matter what these AIs are doing,
the computer scientists who designed them likely don’t know exactly 
how they’re doing it. This is because artificial intelligence 
is often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique array 
of rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? There are many different ways 
to build self-teaching programs. But they all rely on the three 
basic types of machine learning: unsupervised learning, supervised 
learning, and reinforcement learning. To see these in action, let’s imagine researchers are trying
to pull information from a set of medical data containing
thousands of patient profiles. First up, unsupervised learning. This approach would be ideal
for analyzing all the profiles to find general similarities
and useful patterns. Maybe certain patients have similar
disease presentations, or perhaps a treatment produces
specific sets of side effects. This broad pattern-seeking approach 
can be used to identify similarities between patient profiles 
and find emerging patterns, all without human guidance. But let's imagine doctors are looking
for something more specific. These physicians want 
to create an algorithm for diagnosing a particular condition. They begin by collecting two sets of data— medical images and test results
from both healthy patients and those diagnosed with the condition. Then, they input this data into a program designed to identify features
shared by the sick patients but not the healthy patients. Based on how frequently

**Transcript**:
After a three-hour concert by her
favorite Norwegian metal band, Anja finds it difficult to hear 
her friend rave about the show. It sounds like he's speaking
from across the room, and it’s tough to make out his muted voice
over the ringing in her ears. By the next morning, 
the effect has mostly worn off, but Anja still has questions. What caused the symptoms? 
Is her hearing going to fully recover? And can she still go to concerts
without damaging her ears? To answer these questions, we first need to understand what sound is
and how we hear it. Like a pebble creating ripples in water, sound is created when displaced molecules
vibrate through space. While sound vibrations can travel
through solids and liquids, our ears have evolved to process
vibrations in the air. These waves of air pressure enter 
our ear canals and bounce off the eardrum. A trio of bones called the ossicular chain then carries those vibrations 
into the cochlea, transforming waves of air pressure
into waves of cochlear fluid. Here, our perception of sound
begins to take form. The waves of fluid move
the basilar membrane, a tissue lined with tens of thousands
of hair cells. The specific vibration of these hair cells
and the stereocilia on top of each one determine the auditory signal 
our brain perceives. Unfortunately, these essential cells
are also quite vulnerable. There are two properties of sound 
that can damage these cells. The first is volume. The louder a sound is, the greater
the pressure of its vibrations. While the ear’s upper limits vary
from person to person, close range exposure to sound
exceeding 120 decibels can instantly bend or blow out hair cells,
resulting in permanent hearing damage. The pressure of more powerful sounds 
can even dislocate the ossicular chain or burst an eardrum. The other side of this equation 
is the sound’s duration. While dangerously loud sounds 
can injure ears almost instantly, hair cells can also be damaged by exposure to lower sound pressure 
for long periods. For example, hearing a hand dryer is safe 
for the 20 seconds you’re using it. But if you listened 
for 8 consecutive hours, this relatively low-pressure sound 
would overwork the stereocilia and swell the hair cell’s 
supporting tissue. Swollen hair cells are unable to vibrate 
with the appropriate speed and accuracy, making hearing muffled. This kind of hearing loss is known
as a temporary threshold shift, and many people will experience 
it at least once in their lifetime. In Anja’s case, 
the loud sounds of the concert only took three hours
to cause this condition. Fortunately, it's a temporary ailment
that usually resolves as swelling decreases over time. In most cases, simply avoiding hazardous sounds 
gives hair cells all they need to recover. One temporary threshold shift isn’t likely
to cause permanent hearing loss. But frequent exposure 
to dangerous sound levels can lead to a wide range 
of hearing disorders, such as the constant buzz of tinnitus or difficulty understanding speech
in loud environments. Overworked hair cells can also generate
dangerous molecules called reactive oxygen species. These molecules
have unpaired electrons, driving them to steal electrons
from nearby cells and cause permanent damage
to the inner ear. There are numerous strategies you can
adopt for preventing hearing loss. Current research around earbud headphone
use suggests keeping your volume at 80% or less if you’ll be listening for 
more than 90 minutes throughout the day. Noise-isolating headphones can also help 
you listen at lower volumes. Getting a baseline understanding 
of your hearing is essential to protecting 
your auditory system. Just like our eyes and teeth,
our ears also need annual check-ups. Not all communities have
access to audiologists, but organizations around the world are
developing portable hearing tests and easy-to-use apps to bring these
vital resources to remote regions. Finally, wear earplugs
when you’re knowingly exposing yourself to loud sounds for extended periods. An earplug’s effectiveness depends 
on how well you’ve inserted it, so be careful to read the instructions. But when worn correctly, they can ensure you'll be able
to hear your favorite band for many nights to come.

the pressure of its vibrations. While the ear’s upper limits vary
from person to person, close range exposure to sound
exceeding 120 decibels can instantly bend or blow out hair cells,
resulting in permanent hearing damage. The pressure of more powerful sounds 
can even dislocate the ossicular chain or burst an eardrum. The other side of this equation 
is the sound’s duration. While dangerously loud sounds 
can injure ears almost instantly, hair cells can also be damaged by exposure to lower sound pressure 
for long periods. For example, hearing a hand dryer is safe 
for the 20 seconds you’re using it. But if you listened 
for 8 consecutive hours, this relatively low-pressure sound 
would overwork the stereocilia and swell the hair cell’s 
supporting tissue. Swollen hair cells are unable to vibrate 
with the appropriate speed and accuracy, making hearing muffled. This kind of hearing loss is known
as a temporary threshold shift, and many people will experience 
it at least once in their lifetime. In Anja’s case, 
the loud sounds of the concert only took three hours
to cause this condition. Fortunately, it's a temporary ailment
that usually resolves as swelling decreases over time. In most cases, simply avoiding hazardous sounds 
gives hair cells all they need to recover. One temporary threshold shift isn’t likely
to cause permanent hearing loss. But frequent exposure 
to dangerous sound levels can lead to a wide range 
of hearing disorders, such as the constant buzz of tinnitus or difficulty understanding speech
in loud environments. Overworked hair cells can also generate
dangerous molecules called reactive oxygen species. These molecules
have unpaired electrons, driving them to steal electrons
from nearby cells and cause permanent damage
to the inner ear. There are numerous strategies you can
adopt for preventing hearing loss. Current research around earbud headphone
use suggests keeping your volume at 80% or less if you’ll be listening for 
more than 90 minutes throughout the day. Noise-isolating headphones can also help 
you listen at lower volumes. Getting a baseline understanding 
of your hearing is essential to protecting 
your auditory system. Just like our eyes and teeth,
our ears also need annual check-ups. Not all communities have
access to audiologists, but organizations around the world are
developing portable hearing tests and easy-to-use apps to bring these
vital resources to remote regions. Finally, wear earplugs
when you’re knowingly exposing yourself to loud sounds for extended periods. An earplug’s effectiveness depends 
on how well you’ve inserted it, so be careful to read the instructions. But when worn correctly, they can ensure you'll be able
to hear your favorite band for many nights to come.

**Transcript**:
After a three-hour concert by her
favorite Norwegian metal band, Anja finds it difficult to hear 
her friend rave about the show. It sounds like he's speaking
from across the room, and it’s tough to make out his muted voice
over the ringing in her ears. By the next morning, 
the effect has mostly worn off, but Anja still has questions. What caused the symptoms? 
Is her hearing going to fully recover? And can she still go to concerts
without damaging her ears? To answer these questions, we first need to understand what sound is
and how we hear it. Like a pebble creating ripples in water, sound is created when displaced molecules
vibrate through space. While sound vibrations can travel
through solids and liquids, our ears have evolved to process
vibrations in the air. These waves of air pressure enter 
our ear canals and bounce off the eardrum. A trio of bones called the ossicular chain then carries those vibrations 
into the cochlea, transforming waves of air pressure
into waves of cochlear fluid. Here, our perception of sound
begins to take form. The waves of fluid move
the basilar membrane, a tissue lined with tens of thousands
of hair cells. The specific vibration of these hair cells
and the stereocilia on top of each one determine the auditory signal 
our brain perceives. Unfortunately, these essential cells
are also quite vulnerable. There are two properties of sound 
that can damage these cells. The first is volume. The louder a sound is, the greater
the pressure of its vibrations. While the ear’s upper limits vary

**Transcript**:
For as long as we’ve had language,
some people have tried to control it. And some of the most frequent targets 
of this communication regulation are the ums, ers, and likes 
that pepper our conversations. Ancient Greek and Latin texts warned
against speaking with hesitation, modern schools have tried 
to ban the offending terms, and renowned linguist Noam Chomsky
dismissed these expressions as “errors” irrelevant to language. Historically, these speech components
had been lumped into the broader bucket of “disfluencies”— linguistic fillers which distract 
from useful speech. However, none of this controversy has made
these so-called disfluencies less common. They continue to occur roughly 
2 to 3 times per minute in natural speech. And different versions of them can
be found in almost every language, including sign language. So are ums and uhs 
just a habit we can’t break? Or is there more to them
than meets the ear? To answer this question, it helps 
to compare these speech components to other words we use in everyday life. While a written word might have
multiple definitions, we can usually determine its intended
meaning through context. In speech however, a word can take
on additional layers of meaning. Tone of voice, 
the relationship between speakers, and expectations of where 
a conversation will go can imbue even words that seem like filler
with vital information. This is where “um” and “uh” come in. Or “eh” and “ehm,” “tutoa” and “öö,”
“eto” and “ano.” Linguists call these filled pauses, which
are a kind of hesitation phenomenon. And these seemingly 
insignificant interruptions are actually quite meaningful 
in spoken communication. For example, while a silent pause
might be interpreted as a sign for others to start speaking, a filled pause can signal
that you’re not finished yet. Hesitation phenomena can buy time for your
speech to catch up with your thoughts, or to fish out the right word 
for a situation. And they don’t just benefit the speaker— a filled pause lets your listeners know
an important word is on the way. Linguists have even found 
that people are more likely to remember a word 
if it comes after a hesitation. Hesitation phenomena 
aren’t the only parts of speech that take on new meaning during dialogue. Words and phrases such as “like,” 
“well” or “you know” function as discourse markers, ignoring their literal meaning to convey 
something about the sentence in which they appear. Discourse markers direct 
the flow of conversation, and some studies suggest 
that conscientious speakers use more of these phrases to ensure 
everyone is being heard and understood. For example, starting a sentence 
with “Look...” can indicate your attitude and help 
you gauge the listener’s agreement. “I mean” can signal that you’re about
to elaborate on something. And the dreaded “like” 
can perform many functions, such as establishing a loose
connection between thoughts, or introducing someone else's
words or actions. These markers give people a real-time
view into your thought process and help listeners follow, interpret, 
and predict what you’re trying to say. Discourse markers and hesitation phenomena aren’t just useful 
for understanding language— they help us learn it too. In 2011, a study showed toddlers 
common and uncommon objects alongside a recording referring 
to one of the items. When a later recording asked them 
to identify the uncommon object, toddlers performed better if that 
instruction contained a filled pause. This may mean that filled pauses 
cue toddlers to expect novel words, and help them connect new words
to new objects. For adolescents and adults 
learning a second language, filled pauses smooth out awkward 
early conversations. And once they’re more confident, the second-language learner can signal
their newfound fluency by using the appropriate 
hesitation phenomenon. Because, contrary to popular belief, the use of filled pauses doesn't decrease
with mastery of a language. Just because hesitation phenomena
and discourse markers are a natural part of communication 
doesn’t mean they’re always appropriate. Outside of writing dialogue, they serve 
no purpose in most formal writing. And in some contexts, the stigma
these social cues carry can work against the speaker. But in most conversations, 
these seemingly senseless sounds can convey a world of meaning.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 5: Factual Question**
Options: A. Linguists call these filled pauses, which are a kind of hesitation phenomenon., B. Hesitation phenomena can be found in almost every language, including sign language., C. Different versions of them can be found in almost every language, including sign language., D. Historically, these speech components had been lumped into the broader bucket of “disfluencies.”

Although the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the historical label given to hesitations, and option D in Question 5 mentions that hesitations were historically lumped into the broader bucket of "disfluencies." However, a more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that explicitly mentions the term "errors" as the historical label, which is not present in any of the generated MCQs.

A more suitable match can be found in **Question 1: Factual Question**, option C, which states: "Renowned linguist Noam Chomsky dismissed these expressions as “errors” irrelevant to language." This option directly matches the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

Considering this, I would recommend:

**Question 1: Factual Question** as the most similar generated MCQ, with the understanding that the question itself does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, but one of its options (C) aligns with the correct answer.

be found in almost every language, including sign language. So are ums and uhs 
just a habit we can’t break? Or is there more to them
than meets the ear? To answer this question, it helps 
to compare these speech components to other words we use in everyday life. While a written word might have
multiple definitions, we can usually determine its intended
meaning through context. In speech however, a word can take
on additional layers of meaning. Tone of voice, 
the relationship between speakers, and expectations of where 
a conversation will go can imbue even words that seem like filler
with vital information. This is where “um” and “uh” come in. Or “eh” and “ehm,” “tutoa” and “öö,”
“eto” and “ano.” Linguists call these filled pauses, which
are a kind of hesitation phenomenon. And these seemingly 
insignificant interruptions are actually quite meaningful 
in spoken communication. For example, while a silent pause
might be interpreted as a sign for others to start speaking, a filled pause can signal
that you’re not finished yet. Hesitation phenomena can buy time for your
speech to catch up with your thoughts, or to fish out the right word 
for a situation. And they don’t just benefit the speaker— a filled pause lets your listeners know
an important word is on the way. Linguists have even found 
that people are more likely to remember a word 
if it comes after a hesitation. Hesitation phenomena 
aren’t the only parts of speech that take on new meaning during dialogue. Words and phrases such as “like,” 
“well” or “you know” function as discourse markers, ignoring their literal meaning to convey 
something about the sentence in which they appear. Discourse markers direct 
the flow of conversation, and some studies suggest 
that conscientious speakers use more of these phrases to ensure 
everyone is being heard and understood. For example, starting a sentence 
with “Look...” can indicate your attitude and help 
you gauge the listener’s agreement. “I mean” can signal that you’re about
to elaborate on something. And the dreaded “like” 
can perform many functions, such as establishing a loose
connection between thoughts, or introducing someone else's
words or actions. These markers give people a real-time
view into your thought process and help listeners follow, interpret, 
and predict what you’re trying to say. Discourse markers and hesitation phenomena aren’t just useful 
for understanding language— they help us learn it too. In 2011, a study showed toddlers 
common and uncommon objects alongside a recording referring 
to one of the items. When a later recording asked them 
to identify the uncommon object, toddlers performed better if that 
instruction contained a filled pause. This may mean that filled pauses 
cue toddlers to expect novel words, and help them connect new words
to new objects. For adolescents and adults 
learning a second language, filled pauses smooth out awkward 
early conversations. And once they’re more confident, the second-language learner can signal
their newfound fluency by using the appropriate 
hesitation phenomenon. Because, contrary to popular belief, the use of filled pauses doesn't decrease
with mastery of a language. Just because hesitation phenomena
and discourse markers are a natural part of communication 
doesn’t mean they’re always appropriate. Outside of writing dialogue, they serve 
no purpose in most formal writing. And in some contexts, the stigma
these social cues carry can work against the speaker. But in most conversations, 
these seemingly senseless sounds can convey a world of meaning.

For as long as we’ve had language,

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 8: Analytical Question**

Although the options do not exactly match, the question intent and content are similar. Question 8 is an analytical question that requires the test-taker to analyze the information and make a judgment about the use of filled pauses. Option A in Question 8 states that "The use of filled pauses doesn’t decrease with mastery of a language," which is related to the idea that filled pauses are not necessarily a sign of lack of fluency or mastery of a language.

However, a more similar question is not available in the provided set. If I had to choose one, I would say Question 8 is the closest match.

**Index: 8**

Please note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and it would be ideal to generate new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
If this bat were a human,
she'd be in deep trouble. She’s infected with several
deadly viruses, including ones that cause rabies,
SARS, and Ebola. But while her diagnosis would be lethal
for other mammals, this winged wonder is totally unfazed. In fact, she may even spend
the next 30 years living as if this were totally normal–
because for bats, it is. So what’s protecting her
from these dangerous infections? To answer this question,
we first need to understand the relationship between
viruses and their hosts. Every virus has evolved to infect specific
species within a class of creatures. This is why humans are unlikely
to be infected by plant viruses, and why bees don’t catch the flu. However, viruses do sometimes jump
across closely related species And because the new host
has no established immune defenses, the unknown virus presents
a potentially lethal challenge. This is actually bad news
for the virus as well. Their ideal host provides a steady stream
of resources and comes into contact with new parties
to infect— two criteria that are best met
by living hosts. All this to say that successful viruses don’t typically evolve adaptations
that kill their hosts— including the viruses that have infected
our flying friend. The deadly effects of these viruses
aren’t caused by the pathogens directly, but rather, by their host’s uncontrolled
immune response. Infections like Ebola
or certain types of flu have evolved to strain the immune system
of their mammalian host by sending it into overdrive. The body sends hordes
of white blood cells, antibodies and inflammatory molecules
to kill the foreign invader. But if the infection has progressed
to high enough levels, an assault by the immune system
can lead to serious tissue damage. In particularly virulent cases,
this damage can be lethal. And even when it’s not, the site is left vulnerable
to secondary infection. But unlike other mammals, bats have been in an evolutionary arms
race with these viruses for millennia, and they’ve adapted to limit
this kind of self-damage. Their immune system
has a very low inflammatory response; an adaptation likely developed
alongside the other trait that sets them apart from other mammals:
self-powered flight. This energy-intensive process can raise
a bat’s body temperature to over 40ºC. Such a high metabolic rate
comes at a cost; flight produces waste molecules
called Reactive Oxygen Species that damage and break off
fragments of DNA. In other mammals, this loose DNA would be attacked by the immune system
as a foreign invader. But if bats produce these molecules
as often as researchers believe, they may have evolved
a dampened immune response to their own damaged DNA. In fact, certain genes associated
with sensing broken DNA and deploying inflammatory molecules
are absent from the bat genome. The result is a controlled
low-level inflammatory response that allows bats to coexist
with the viruses in their systems. Even more impressive, bats are able to host these viruses
for decades without any negative health consequences. According to a 2013 study, bats
have evolved efficient repair genes to counteract the frequent
DNA damage they sustain. These repair genes may also contribute
to their long lives. Animal chromosomes end with a DNA sequence
called a telomere. These sequences shorten over time
in a process that many believe contributes
to cell aging. But bat telomeres shorten much more slowly
than their mammalian cousins— granting them lifespans
as long as 41 years. Of course, bats aren’t totally
invincible to disease, whether caused by bacteria,
unfamiliar viruses, or even fungi. Bat populations have been ravaged
by a fungal infection called white-nose syndrome, which can fatally disrupt hibernation
and deteriorate wing tissue. These conditions prevent bats
from performing critical roles in their ecosystems, like helping
with pollination and seed dispersal, and consuming pests and insects. To protect these animals from harm,
and ourselves from infection, humans need to stop encroaching
on bat habitats and ecosystems. Hopefully, preserving these populations will allow scientists to better understand
bats’ unique antiviral defense systems. And maybe one day, this research will
help our own viral immunity take flight.

**Transcript**:
If this bat were a human,
she'd be in deep trouble. She’s infected with several
deadly viruses, including ones that cause rabies,
SARS, and Ebola. But while her diagnosis would be lethal
for other mammals, this winged wonder is totally unfazed. In fact, she may even spend
the next 30 years living as if this were totally normal–
because for bats, it is. So what’s protecting her
from these dangerous infections? To answer this question,
we first need to understand the relationship between
viruses and their hosts. Every virus has evolved to infect specific
species within a class of creatures. This is why humans are unlikely
to be infected by plant viruses, and why bees don’t catch the flu. However, viruses do sometimes jump
across closely related species And because the new host
has no established immune defenses, the unknown virus presents
a potentially lethal challenge. This is actually bad news
for the virus as well. Their ideal host provides a steady stream
of resources and comes into contact with new parties
to infect— two criteria that are best met
by living hosts. All this to say that successful viruses don’t typically evolve adaptations
that kill their hosts— including the viruses that have infected
our flying friend. The deadly effects of these viruses
aren’t caused by the pathogens directly, but rather, by their host’s uncontrolled
immune response. Infections like Ebola
or certain types of flu have evolved to strain the immune system
of their mammalian host by sending it into overdrive. The body sends hordes
of white blood cells, antibodies and inflammatory molecules
to kill the foreign invader. But if the infection has progressed
to high enough levels, an assault by the immune system
can lead to serious tissue damage. In particularly virulent cases,
this damage can be lethal. And even when it’s not, the site is left vulnerable
to secondary infection. But unlike other mammals, bats have been in an evolutionary arms
race with these viruses for millennia, and they’ve adapted to limit
this kind of self-damage. Their immune system
has a very low inflammatory response; an adaptation likely developed
alongside the other trait that sets them apart from other mammals:
self-powered flight. This energy-intensive process can raise
a bat’s body temperature to over 40ºC. Such a high metabolic rate
comes at a cost; flight produces waste molecules
called Reactive Oxygen Species that damage and break off
fragments of DNA. In other mammals, this loose DNA would be attacked by the immune system
as a foreign invader. But if bats produce these molecules
as often as researchers believe, they may have evolved
a dampened immune response to their own damaged DNA. In fact, certain genes associated
with sensing broken DNA and deploying inflammatory molecules
are absent from the bat genome. The result is a controlled
low-level inflammatory response that allows bats to coexist
with the viruses in their systems. Even more impressive, bats are able to host these viruses
for decades without any negative health consequences. According to a 2013 study, bats
have evolved efficient repair genes to counteract the frequent
DNA damage they sustain. These repair genes may also contribute
to their long lives. Animal chromosomes end with a DNA sequence
called a telomere. These sequences shorten over time
in a process that many believe contributes
to cell aging. But bat telomeres shorten much more slowly
than their mammalian cousins— granting them lifespans
as long as 41 years. Of course, bats aren’t totally
invincible to disease, whether caused by bacteria,
unfamiliar viruses, or even fungi. Bat populations have been ravaged
by a fungal infection called white-nose syndrome, which can fatally disrupt hibernation
and deteriorate wing tissue. These conditions prevent bats
from performing critical roles in their ecosystems, like helping
with pollination and seed dispersal, and consuming pests and insects. To protect these animals from harm,
and ourselves from infection, humans need to stop encroaching
on bat habitats and ecosystems. Hopefully, preserving these populations will allow scientists to better understand
bats’ unique antiviral defense systems. And maybe one day, this research will
help our own viral immunity take flight.

**Transcript**:
On the dusty roads of a small village, a travelling salesman was having
difficulty selling his wares. He’d recently traversed the region 
just a few weeks ago, and most of the villagers had already
seen his supply. So he wandered the outskirts of the town in the hopes of finding 
some new customers. Unfortunately, the road was largely
deserted, and the salesman was about to turn back, when he heard a high-pitched yelp
coming from the edge of the forest. Following the screams to their source,
he discovered a trapped tanuki. While these racoon-like creatures 
were known for their wily ways, this one appeared terrified and powerless. The salesman freed 
the struggling creature, but before he could tend to its wounds,
it bolted into the undergrowth. The next day, he set off 
on his usual route. As he trudged along, 
he spotted a discarded tea kettle. It was rusty and old— but perhaps 
he could sell it to the local monks. The salesman polished it 
until it sparkled and shone. He carried the kettle to Morin-ji Temple
and presented it to the solemn monks. His timing was perfect— they were in need of a large kettle
for an important service, and purchased his pot 
for a handsome price. To open the ceremony, they began 
to pour cups of tea for each monk— but the kettle cooled too quickly. It had to be reheated often throughout
the long service, and when it was hot,
it seemed to squirm in the pourer’s hand. By the end of the ceremony, the monks
felt cheated by their purchase, and called for the salesman to return 
and explain himself. The following morning, 
the salesman examined the pot, but he couldn’t find 
anything unusual about it. Hoping a cup of tea 
would help them think, they set the kettle on the fire. Within moments, the metal 
began to sweat. Suddenly, it sprouted a scrubby tail,
furry paws and pointed nose. With a yelp, the salesman recognized
the tanuki he’d freed. The salesman was shocked. He’d heard tales of shape-shifting tanuki who transformed by pulling
on their testicles. But they were usually
troublesome tricksters, who played embarrassing pranks
on travellers, or made it rain money 
that later dissolved into leaves. Some people even placed tanuki statues
outside their homes and businesses to trick potential pranksters
into taking their antics elsewhere. However, this tanuki only smiled sweetly. Why had he chosen this unsuspecting form? The tanuki explained that he wanted
to repay the salesman’s kindness. However, he’d grown too hot 
as a tea kettle, and didn’t like being burned,
scrubbed, or polished. The monk and salesman laughed, both
impressed by this honourable trickster. From that day on, the tanuki became
an esteemed guest of the temple. He could frequently be found 
telling tales and performing tricks that amused even the most serious monks. Villagers came from far away 
to see the temple tanuki, and the salesman visited often to share
tea made from an entirely normal kettle.

it seemed to squirm in the pourer’s hand. By the end of the ceremony, the monks
felt cheated by their purchase, and called for the salesman to return 
and explain himself. The following morning, 
the salesman examined the pot, but he couldn’t find 
anything unusual about it. Hoping a cup of tea 
would help them think, they set the kettle on the fire. Within moments, the metal 
began to sweat. Suddenly, it sprouted a scrubby tail,
furry paws and pointed nose. With a yelp, the salesman recognized
the tanuki he’d freed. The salesman was shocked. He’d heard tales of shape-shifting tanuki who transformed by pulling
on their testicles. But they were usually
troublesome tricksters, who played embarrassing pranks
on travellers, or made it rain money 
that later dissolved into leaves. Some people even placed tanuki statues
outside their homes and businesses to trick potential pranksters
into taking their antics elsewhere. However, this tanuki only smiled sweetly. Why had he chosen this unsuspecting form? The tanuki explained that he wanted
to repay the salesman’s kindness. However, he’d grown too hot 
as a tea kettle, and didn’t like being burned,
scrubbed, or polished. The monk and salesman laughed, both
impressed by this honourable trickster. From that day on, the tanuki became
an esteemed guest of the temple. He could frequently be found 
telling tales and performing tricks that amused even the most serious monks. Villagers came from far away 
to see the temple tanuki, and the salesman visited often to share
tea made from an entirely normal kettle.

**Transcript**:
On the dusty roads of a small village, a travelling salesman was having
difficulty selling his wares. He’d recently traversed the region 
just a few weeks ago, and most of the villagers had already
seen his supply. So he wandered the outskirts of the town in the hopes of finding 
some new customers. Unfortunately, the road was largely
deserted, and the salesman was about to turn back, when he heard a high-pitched yelp
coming from the edge of the forest. Following the screams to their source,
he discovered a trapped tanuki. While these racoon-like creatures 
were known for their wily ways, this one appeared terrified and powerless. The salesman freed 
the struggling creature, but before he could tend to its wounds,
it bolted into the undergrowth. The next day, he set off 
on his usual route. As he trudged along, 
he spotted a discarded tea kettle. It was rusty and old— but perhaps 
he could sell it to the local monks. The salesman polished it 
until it sparkled and shone. He carried the kettle to Morin-ji Temple
and presented it to the solemn monks. His timing was perfect— they were in need of a large kettle
for an important service, and purchased his pot 
for a handsome price. To open the ceremony, they began 
to pour cups of tea for each monk— but the kettle cooled too quickly. It had to be reheated often throughout
the long service, and when it was hot,
it seemed to squirm in the pourer’s hand. By the end of the ceremony, the monks
felt cheated by their purchase, and called for the salesman to return 
and explain himself. The following morning, 
the salesman examined the pot, but he couldn’t find 
anything unusual about it. Hoping a cup of tea 
would help them think, they set the kettle on the fire. Within moments, the metal 
began to sweat. Suddenly, it sprouted a scrubby tail,
furry paws and pointed nose. With a yelp, the salesman recognized
the tanuki he’d freed. The salesman was shocked. He’d heard tales of shape-shifting tanuki who transformed by pulling
on their testicles. But they were usually
troublesome tricksters, who played embarrassing pranks
on travellers, or made it rain money 
that later dissolved into leaves. Some people even placed tanuki statues
outside their homes and businesses to trick potential pranksters

**Transcript**:
Have you ever talked with a friend
about a problem only to realize that he just doesn't seem to grasp
why the issue is so important to you? Have you ever presented an idea to
a group and it's met with utter confusion? Or maybe you've been in an argument when the other person suddenly accuses you of not listening 
to what they're saying at all? What's going on here? The answer is miscommunication, and in some form or another, we've all experienced it. It can lead to confusion, animosity, misunderstanding, or even crashing a multimillion
dollar probe into the surface of Mars. The fact is even when face-to-face
with another person, in the very same room, and speaking the same language, human communication is incredibly complex. But the good news is 
that a basic understanding of what happens when we communicate can help us prevent miscommunication. For decades, researchers have asked,
"What happens when we communicate?" One interpretation,
called the transmission model, views communication as a message that
moves directly from one person to another, similar to someone tossing a ball
and walking away. But in reality, this simplistic model doesn't account
for communication's complexity. Enter the transactional model, which acknowledges the many 
added challenges of communicating. With this model, it's more accurate
to think of communication between people as a game of catch. As we communicate our message,
we receive feedback from the other party. Through the transaction,
we create meaning together. But from this exchange,
further complications arise. It's not like the Star Trek universe, where some characters 
can Vulcan mind meld, fully sharing thoughts and feelings. As humans, we can't help but send
and receive messages through our own subjective lenses. When communicating, one person expresses
her interpretation of a message, and the person she's communicating with hears his own interpretation 
of that message. Our perceptual filters continually shift
meanings and interpretations. Remember that game of catch? Imagine it with a lump of clay. As each person touches it, they shape it to fit 
their own unique perceptions based on any number of variables, like knowledge or past experience, 
age, race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or family background. Simultaneously, every person interprets
the message they receive based on their relationship 
with the other person, and their unique understanding of the semantics and connotations 
of the exact words being used. They could also be distracted
by other stimuli, such as traffic or a growling stomach. Even emotion might cloud 
their understanding, and by adding more people
into a conversation, each with their own subjectivities, the complexity of communication
grows exponentially. So as the lump of clay goes back and forth
from one person to another, reworked, reshaped, and always changing, it's no wonder our messages sometimes
turn into a mush of miscommunication. But, luckily, there are some 
simple practices that can help us all navigate our daily
interactions for better communication. One: recognize that passive hearing
and active listening are not the same. Engage actively with the verbal
and nonverbal feedback of others, and adjust your message to facilitate
greater understanding. Two: listen with your eyes and ears,
as well as with your gut. Remember that communication 
is more than just words. Three: take time to understand as you try
to be understood. In the rush to express ourselves, it's easy to forget that communication
is a two-way street. Be open to what 
the other person might say. And finally, four: Be aware of your personal 
perceptual filters. Elements of your experience, including your culture, 
community, and family, influence how you see the world. Say, "This is how I see the problem,
but how do you see it?" Don't assume that your perception
is the objective truth. That'll help you work toward sharing
a dialogue with others to reach a common understanding together.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever talked with a friend
about a problem only to realize that he just doesn't seem to grasp
why the issue is so important to you? Have you ever presented an idea to
a group and it's met with utter confusion? Or maybe you've been in an argument when the other person suddenly accuses you of not listening 
to what they're saying at all? What's going on here? The answer is miscommunication, and in some form or another, we've all experienced it. It can lead to confusion, animosity, misunderstanding, or even crashing a multimillion
dollar probe into the surface of Mars. The fact is even when face-to-face
with another person, in the very same room, and speaking the same language, human communication is incredibly complex. But the good news is 
that a basic understanding of what happens when we communicate can help us prevent miscommunication. For decades, researchers have asked,
"What happens when we communicate?" One interpretation,
called the transmission model, views communication as a message that
moves directly from one person to another, similar to someone tossing a ball
and walking away. But in reality, this simplistic model doesn't account
for communication's complexity. Enter the transactional model, which acknowledges the many 
added challenges of communicating. With this model, it's more accurate
to think of communication between people as a game of catch. As we communicate our message,
we receive feedback from the other party. Through the transaction,
we create meaning together. But from this exchange,
further complications arise. It's not like the Star Trek universe, where some characters 
can Vulcan mind meld, fully sharing thoughts and feelings. As humans, we can't help but send
and receive messages through our own subjective lenses. When communicating, one person expresses
her interpretation of a message, and the person she's communicating with hears his own interpretation 
of that message. Our perceptual filters continually shift
meanings and interpretations. Remember that game of catch? Imagine it with a lump of clay. As each person touches it, they shape it to fit 
their own unique perceptions based on any number of variables, like knowledge or past experience, 
age, race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or family background. Simultaneously, every person interprets
the message they receive based on their relationship 
with the other person, and their unique understanding of the semantics and connotations 
of the exact words being used. They could also be distracted
by other stimuli, such as traffic or a growling stomach. Even emotion might cloud 
their understanding, and by adding more people
into a conversation, each with their own subjectivities, the complexity of communication
grows exponentially. So as the lump of clay goes back and forth
from one person to another, reworked, reshaped, and always changing, it's no wonder our messages sometimes
turn into a mush of miscommunication. But, luckily, there are some 
simple practices that can help us all navigate our daily
interactions for better communication. One: recognize that passive hearing
and active listening are not the same. Engage actively with the verbal
and nonverbal feedback of others, and adjust your message to facilitate
greater understanding. Two: listen with your eyes and ears,
as well as with your gut. Remember that communication 
is more than just words. Three: take time to understand as you try
to be understood. In the rush to express ourselves, it's easy to forget that communication
is a two-way street. Be open to what 
the other person might say. And finally, four: Be aware of your personal 
perceptual filters. Elements of your experience, including your culture, 
community, and family, influence how you see the world. Say, "This is how I see the problem,
but how do you see it?" Don't assume that your perception
is the objective truth. That'll help you work toward sharing
a dialogue with others to reach a common understanding together.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1589,
the town of Bedburg, Germany, held a highly publicized trial. Peter Stubbe was accused
of several gruesome crimes, including murder, assault,
and cannibalism. But perhaps the most sinister accusation
of them all, was of being a werewolf. In his confession, Peter claimed that
the devil had given him a magic girdle, which allowed him to transform into a wolf
and perform his horrific acts. Stories of werewolves existed well before
this trial and continue to live on today. They’re especially prominent
in European literature and folklore, and often found in cultures where the wolf
is the largest natural predator. Over the years, the image of the werewolf
has continuously evolved, often reflecting the fears and prejudices
of that time. In early literature, werewolves were
sometimes painted as sympathetic figures: victims of curses who longed to return
to their human form. In the story of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest written accounts of
werewolves from over 4.000 years ago, a shepherd falls in love
with the goddess of love, Ishtar, who transforms him into a wolf
when she grows tired of his affection. In this and several other
stories that followed, werewolves were often men who had fallen
prey to deceitful, alluring women. In the medieval story of “Bisclavret,” a knight is trapped in wolf form
by the cunning of his wife, who leaves him to elope with another man. Other early stories explored fears
about the darker side of human nature, including taboos such as
cannibalism and murder. In ancient Greek mythology, King Lycaon was transformed
into a wolf by Zeus, after he attempted to trick the god
into eating human flesh. As Catholicism spread throughout Europe, werewolves became increasingly linked
to magic, sorcery, and pagan belief. By the 16th century, many people struggled
separating werewolf fiction from fact. Political, economic,
and religious upheavals gave rise to the infamous
European witch trials. And while witches were the main
targets, in some areas, alleged werewolves like Peter Stubbe
were also tried and executed. Today, some historians view the trials
as driven by a fear of outsiders, as well as society's early attempts
to understand brutal crimes. While public belief in werewolves
died down by the 17th century as medicine and psychology advanced, the myth would re-emerge in literature. By the Victorian period,
werewolves had transformed again, often embodying fears of moral
and psychological decay. In George Reynolds’s
“Wagner the Wehrwolf,” the protagonist makes a pact with the
devil to achieve eternal youth. But in return, he transforms
into a violent howling wolf at the end of every month. By the mid-20th century, werewolves found a new home to haunt—
the silver screen. Here, the werewolf began to take
its modern form. For example, the idea that the curse
could be transmitted through bites and triggered by a full moon was first popularized with the
1935 film “Werewolf of London.” Produced in the United States, the film identifies the werewolf infection
as originating from the east— specifically Tibet. This mirrored xenophobic fears
of the time— that East Asian immigrants
into North America and Europe threatened the stability and power
of the west. Werewolf hunters adopted silver
as their weapon of choice after its use in 1941′s “The Wolf Man.” Written by Jewish writer Curt Siodmak, the film is viewed by many scholars
as an allegory for Nazi brutality. In the film, a pentagram appears on the
palm of the werewolf’s next victim, which is thought to allude to the
compulsory Star of David badges found in Europe during the 1930 and 40s. Since the 1950s, cinematic werewolves have
frequently infected a new group of victims: the teenager. Here, werewolves are often symbols
of male aggression and the uncertainty of adolescence. By the end of the century, some films began to use
the beastly transformation to explore themes of puberty, occasionally with a distinctly
feminist perspective. Yet, like all great monsters,
the werewolf lives on, and will continue changing to fit
its future audience’s needs. But, for the time being, it may
be best to stock up on silver, keep to the road, and beware the moon.

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1589,
the town of Bedburg, Germany, held a highly publicized trial. Peter Stubbe was accused
of several gruesome crimes, including murder, assault,
and cannibalism. But perhaps the most sinister accusation
of them all, was of being a werewolf. In his confession, Peter claimed that
the devil had given him a magic girdle, which allowed him to transform into a wolf
and perform his horrific acts. Stories of werewolves existed well before
this trial and continue to live on today. They’re especially prominent
in European literature and folklore, and often found in cultures where the wolf
is the largest natural predator. Over the years, the image of the werewolf
has continuously evolved, often reflecting the fears and prejudices
of that time. In early literature, werewolves were
sometimes painted as sympathetic figures: victims of curses who longed to return
to their human form. In the story of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest written accounts of
werewolves from over 4.000 years ago, a shepherd falls in love
with the goddess of love, Ishtar, who transforms him into a wolf
when she grows tired of his affection. In this and several other
stories that followed, werewolves were often men who had fallen
prey to deceitful, alluring women. In the medieval story of “Bisclavret,” a knight is trapped in wolf form
by the cunning of his wife, who leaves him to elope with another man. Other early stories explored fears
about the darker side of human nature, including taboos such as
cannibalism and murder. In ancient Greek mythology, King Lycaon was transformed
into a wolf by Zeus, after he attempted to trick the god
into eating human flesh. As Catholicism spread throughout Europe, werewolves became increasingly linked
to magic, sorcery, and pagan belief. By the 16th century, many people struggled
separating werewolf fiction from fact. Political, economic,
and religious upheavals gave rise to the infamous
European witch trials. And while witches were the main
targets, in some areas, alleged werewolves like Peter Stubbe
were also tried and executed. Today, some historians view the trials
as driven by a fear of outsiders, as well as society's early attempts
to understand brutal crimes. While public belief in werewolves
died down by the 17th century as medicine and psychology advanced, the myth would re-emerge in literature. By the Victorian period,
werewolves had transformed again, often embodying fears of moral
and psychological decay. In George Reynolds’s
“Wagner the Wehrwolf,” the protagonist makes a pact with the
devil to achieve eternal youth. But in return, he transforms
into a violent howling wolf at the end of every month. By the mid-20th century, werewolves found a new home to haunt—
the silver screen. Here, the werewolf began to take
its modern form. For example, the idea that the curse
could be transmitted through bites and triggered by a full moon was first popularized with the
1935 film “Werewolf of London.” Produced in the United States, the film identifies the werewolf infection
as originating from the east— specifically Tibet. This mirrored xenophobic fears
of the time— that East Asian immigrants
into North America and Europe threatened the stability and power
of the west. Werewolf hunters adopted silver
as their weapon of choice after its use in 1941′s “The Wolf Man.” Written by Jewish writer Curt Siodmak, the film is viewed by many scholars
as an allegory for Nazi brutality. In the film, a pentagram appears on the
palm of the werewolf’s next victim, which is thought to allude to the
compulsory Star of David badges found in Europe during the 1930 and 40s. Since the 1950s, cinematic werewolves have

**Transcript**:
You’re halfway through what’s supposedly one of the greatest
novels of the 20th century, but nothing quite makes sense. Narrating characters offer clashing
versions of the same story and often seem unsure who, what,
or when they’re talking about. Seemingly minor details trigger intense
emotional reactions you don't understand. And the prose is loaded with convoluted
sentences and outlandish imagery. Confused? Good— that means
you’re on the right track. William Faulkner is considered
one of America’s most remarkable and perplexing writers. Fortunately, he wasn’t just
toying with his audience. Faulkner used confusion intentionally, to explore the most mysterious parts
of the human mind and investigate pressing issues of
personal, racial, and regional identity. The result is a body of work that’s
shocking, inventive, and often hilarious— but above all, challenging. So what clues should readers look
for to navigate his literary labyrinths? Many of Faulkner’s novels are set
in the fictional county of Yoknapatawpha— a fantastical reimagining 
of Lafayette County, Mississippi, where he spent most of his life. Born in 1897, Faulkner grew up steeped
in oral storytelling traditions, from folklore and family histories
to local legends of Civil War glory. However, these grand myths didn’t match
the messy reality of the American South, divided by racist Jim Crow laws and plagued by the legacies of slavery
and colonial violence. All these tensions come alive 
inside Yoknapatawpha. Full of horror, humor, and human tragedy, Faulkner’s stories feature 
many memorable characters, like the spurned bride who sleeps
beside her would-be husband’s corpse, or the duped sharecropper obsessively
hunting for imaginary coins. At first glance, these characters
seem grotesquely absurd. But under the surface, 
they all reflect his obsession with how people process the past— what they stubbornly hold on to,
unwittingly forget and willingly distort. Much of Faulkner’s fiction is told
from multiple perspectives, offering the reader several versions
of the story’s events. For example, “The Sound and the Fury”
combines the narratives of Benjy, Quentin, and Jason Compson, three brothers haunted by memories
of their sister Caddy. One brother's narration will occasionally
fill the gaps left by another's, but just as often,
their accounts contradict each other. To make things more confusing, 
Benjy’s narration is disjointed in time, slipping between past and present
without warning. Meanwhile, Quentin's section
confuses fact and fantasy as it jumps backward in time
from the day of his untimely death. Only the aggressive, money-hungry Jason
attempts to embrace the present— but even he is constantly overtaken
by past resentments. Following these threads
can be bewildering, but Faulkner wants the audience to share
in the characters’ confusion. This approach allows readers
to understand the Compsons’ biases and blindspots firsthand. And since his characters’ distortions
of the past often reflect larger denials
of Southern history, it also allows Faulkner to explore 
his own anxieties about the South. For example, his novel “Light in August”
deliberately induces ambiguity about a character’s racial origins in ways
that undermine rigid Jim Crow policies. And in “Absalom, Absalom!”
narrating townsfolk remark that “no one knew how” a local landowner had come
into his property, and that his house was built
“apparently out of nothing.” This kind of evasive language shows how
characters are desperate to cover up the region's intolerable history
of genocide and slavery. But even when exploring
the heaviest topics, Faulkner spellbinds readers
with verbal acrobatics. One particularly bewildering sentence
in “Absalom, Absalom!” runs 1,288 words long, and features locals haggling
over “violently-colored candy,” a “cloudy swirl of chickens,”
and a hard-drinking planter who’s compared to both 
a worn-out cannon and a showgirl. Even his jokes can breed more confusion, such as when Benjy Compson conflates
his sister Caddy with golf caddies. Reading Faulkner is rarely easy,
but it is deeply rewarding. He invites readers to contemplate the
unreliable nature of history and memory. And in teaching us to embrace confusion and recognize the limits 
of our perception, Faulkner can help us listen 
for hidden meanings in the sound and fury that surround us.

**Transcript**:
You’re halfway through what’s supposedly one of the greatest
novels of the 20th century, but nothing quite makes sense. Narrating characters offer clashing
versions of the same story and often seem unsure who, what,
or when they’re talking about. Seemingly minor details trigger intense
emotional reactions you don't understand. And the prose is loaded with convoluted
sentences and outlandish imagery. Confused? Good— that means
you’re on the right track. William Faulkner is considered
one of America’s most remarkable and perplexing writers. Fortunately, he wasn’t just
toying with his audience. Faulkner used confusion intentionally, to explore the most mysterious parts
of the human mind and investigate pressing issues of
personal, racial, and regional identity. The result is a body of work that’s
shocking, inventive, and often hilarious— but above all, challenging. So what clues should readers look
for to navigate his literary labyrinths? Many of Faulkner’s novels are set
in the fictional county of Yoknapatawpha— a fantastical reimagining 
of Lafayette County, Mississippi, where he spent most of his life. Born in 1897, Faulkner grew up steeped
in oral storytelling traditions, from folklore and family histories
to local legends of Civil War glory. However, these grand myths didn’t match
the messy reality of the American South, divided by racist Jim Crow laws and plagued by the legacies of slavery
and colonial violence. All these tensions come alive 
inside Yoknapatawpha. Full of horror, humor, and human tragedy, Faulkner’s stories feature 
many memorable characters, like the spurned bride who sleeps
beside her would-be husband’s corpse, or the duped sharecropper obsessively
hunting for imaginary coins. At first glance, these characters
seem grotesquely absurd. But under the surface, 
they all reflect his obsession with how people process the past— what they stubbornly hold on to,
unwittingly forget and willingly distort. Much of Faulkner’s fiction is told
from multiple perspectives, offering the reader several versions
of the story’s events. For example, “The Sound and the Fury”
combines the narratives of Benjy, Quentin, and Jason Compson, three brothers haunted by memories
of their sister Caddy. One brother's narration will occasionally
fill the gaps left by another's, but just as often,
their accounts contradict each other. To make things more confusing, 
Benjy’s narration is disjointed in time, slipping between past and present
without warning. Meanwhile, Quentin's section
confuses fact and fantasy as it jumps backward in time
from the day of his untimely death. Only the aggressive, money-hungry Jason
attempts to embrace the present— but even he is constantly overtaken
by past resentments. Following these threads
can be bewildering, but Faulkner wants the audience to share
in the characters’ confusion. This approach allows readers
to understand the Compsons’ biases and blindspots firsthand. And since his characters’ distortions
of the past often reflect larger denials
of Southern history, it also allows Faulkner to explore 
his own anxieties about the South. For example, his novel “Light in August”
deliberately induces ambiguity about a character’s racial origins in ways
that undermine rigid Jim Crow policies. And in “Absalom, Absalom!”
narrating townsfolk remark that “no one knew how” a local landowner had come
into his property, and that his house was built
“apparently out of nothing.” This kind of evasive language shows how
characters are desperate to cover up the region's intolerable history
of genocide and slavery. But even when exploring
the heaviest topics, Faulkner spellbinds readers
with verbal acrobatics. One particularly bewildering sentence
in “Absalom, Absalom!” runs 1,288 words long, and features locals haggling
over “violently-colored candy,” a “cloudy swirl of chickens,”
and a hard-drinking planter who’s compared to both 
a worn-out cannon and a showgirl. Even his jokes can breed more confusion, such as when Benjy Compson conflates
his sister Caddy with golf caddies. Reading Faulkner is rarely easy,
but it is deeply rewarding. He invites readers to contemplate the
unreliable nature of history and memory. And in teaching us to embrace confusion and recognize the limits 
of our perception, Faulkner can help us listen 
for hidden meanings in the sound and fury that surround us.

**Transcript**:
You and your friend need to ace 
Friday’s exam to avoid summer classes, and after a week of studying, you both
feel confident that you pulled it off. But when you get your grades back, they’re much lower 
than the two of you expected. You’re devastated. However, your friend doesn't
seem too bothered, and it's making you wonder why you can't
shake this off like they can. But should you really be trying
to look on the bright side? And is controlling our emotions 
even possible in the first place? The answer to the last question
is a definitive “yes.” There are numerous strategies
for regulating our emotions, and one framework to understand these
techniques is called the Process Model. Psychologists use this tool to identify
where and how to intervene in the process that forms our emotions. That process has four steps: first, we enter a situation, 
real or imagined, and that draws our attention. Then we evaluate, or appraise, 
the situation and whether it helps or hinders our goals. Finally, this appraisal leads to a set of 
changes in how we feel, think, and behave, known as an emotional response. Each step of this process offers 
an opportunity to consciously intervene and change our emotions, and the Process Model outlines what 
strategies we might try at each phase. To see this in action, let’s imagine
you’ve been invited to the same party as your least-favorite ex
and their new partner. Your first strategy could be avoiding
the situation altogether by skipping the party. But if you do attend, you could also try 
modifying the situation by choosing not to interact with your ex. If that’s proving difficult,
you might want to shift your attention, maybe by playing a game with your friends rather than focusing 
on your ex’s new partner. Another option would be to re-evaluate
how you think about the situation. After seriously reappraising things, you might realize that you don’t
care who your ex dates. If none of these strategies work, you can always try tempering 
your emotional response after the fact. But this can be tricky. Many of the easiest ways to do this, like hiding your emotions or trying 
to change them with recreational drugs, generally lead to more negative feelings
and health concerns in the long term. More sustainable strategies here include
going for a long walk, taking slow, deep breaths, or talking 
with someone in your support system. While using all these strategies well 
takes practice, learning to notice your emotions and reflect on where they’re coming from
is half the battle. And once you’ve truly internalized 
that you can regulate your emotions, doing so becomes much easier. But should you use these techniques 
to constantly maintain a good mood? That answer depends on how you define
what makes a mood “good.” It's tempting to think we should always
try to avoid sadness and frustration, but no emotion is inherently good or bad— they’re either helpful or unhelpful
depending on the situation. For example, if a friend is telling you
about the loss of a loved one, feeling and expressing sadness 
isn’t just appropriate, it can help you empathize
and support them. Conversely, while it’s unhealthy 
to regularly ignore your emotions, forcing a smile to get through a one-time
annoyance is perfectly reasonable. We hear a lot of mixed messages
about emotions. Some pressure us to stay upbeat while others tell us to simply take 
our emotions as they come. But in reality,
each person has to find their own balance. So if the question is:
“should you always try to be happy?” The answer is no. Studies suggest that people 
fixated on happiness often experience secondary
negative emotions, like guilt, or frustration over being upset, and disappointment that they
don't feel happier. This doesn't mean you should let
sadness or anger take over. But strategies like reappraisal can help
you re-evaluate your thoughts about a situation, allowing you to accept that you feel sad and cultivate hope 
that things will get better.

Friday’s exam to avoid summer classes, and after a week of studying, you both
feel confident that you pulled it off. But when you get your grades back, they’re much lower 
than the two of you expected. You’re devastated. However, your friend doesn't
seem too bothered, and it's making you wonder why you can't
shake this off like they can. But should you really be trying
to look on the bright side? And is controlling our emotions 
even possible in the first place? The answer to the last question
is a definitive “yes.” There are numerous strategies
for regulating our emotions, and one framework to understand these
techniques is called the Process Model. Psychologists use this tool to identify
where and how to intervene in the process that forms our emotions. That process has four steps: first, we enter a situation, 
real or imagined, and that draws our attention. Then we evaluate, or appraise, 
the situation and whether it helps or hinders our goals. Finally, this appraisal leads to a set of 
changes in how we feel, think, and behave, known as an emotional response. Each step of this process offers 
an opportunity to consciously intervene and change our emotions, and the Process Model outlines what 
strategies we might try at each phase. To see this in action, let’s imagine
you’ve been invited to the same party as your least-favorite ex
and their new partner. Your first strategy could be avoiding
the situation altogether by skipping the party. But if you do attend, you could also try 
modifying the situation by choosing not to interact with your ex. If that’s proving difficult,
you might want to shift your attention, maybe by playing a game with your friends rather than focusing 
on your ex’s new partner. Another option would be to re-evaluate
how you think about the situation. After seriously reappraising things, you might realize that you don’t
care who your ex dates. If none of these strategies work, you can always try tempering 
your emotional response after the fact. But this can be tricky. Many of the easiest ways to do this, like hiding your emotions or trying 
to change them with recreational drugs, generally lead to more negative feelings
and health concerns in the long term. More sustainable strategies here include
going for a long walk, taking slow, deep breaths, or talking 
with someone in your support system. While using all these strategies well 
takes practice, learning to notice your emotions and reflect on where they’re coming from
is half the battle. And once you’ve truly internalized 
that you can regulate your emotions, doing so becomes much easier. But should you use these techniques 
to constantly maintain a good mood? That answer depends on how you define
what makes a mood “good.” It's tempting to think we should always
try to avoid sadness and frustration, but no emotion is inherently good or bad— they’re either helpful or unhelpful
depending on the situation. For example, if a friend is telling you
about the loss of a loved one, feeling and expressing sadness 
isn’t just appropriate, it can help you empathize
and support them. Conversely, while it’s unhealthy 
to regularly ignore your emotions, forcing a smile to get through a one-time
annoyance is perfectly reasonable. We hear a lot of mixed messages
about emotions. Some pressure us to stay upbeat while others tell us to simply take 
our emotions as they come. But in reality,
each person has to find their own balance. So if the question is:
“should you always try to be happy?” The answer is no. Studies suggest that people 
fixated on happiness often experience secondary
negative emotions, like guilt, or frustration over being upset, and disappointment that they
don't feel happier. This doesn't mean you should let
sadness or anger take over. But strategies like reappraisal can help
you re-evaluate your thoughts about a situation, allowing you to accept that you feel sad and cultivate hope 
that things will get better.

**Transcript**:
Creating intelligence on a computer. This has been the Holy Grail
for artificial intelligence for quite some time. But how do we get there? So we view ourselves as highly
intelligent beings. So it's logical to study our own brains, the substrate of our cognition,
for creating artificial intelligence. Imagine if we could replicate
how our own brains work on a computer. But now consider the journey
that would be required. The human brain contains
86 billion neurons. Each is constantly communicating
with thousands of others, and each has individual
characteristics of its own. Capturing the human brain on a computer may simply be too big
and too complex a problem to tackle with the technology
and the knowledge that we have today. I believe that we can capture
a brain on a computer, but we have to start smaller. Much smaller. These insects have three of the most
fascinating brains in the world to me. While they do not possess
human-level intelligence, each is remarkable at a particular task. Think of them as highly
trained specialists. African dung beetles are really good
at rolling large balls in straight lines. (Laughter) Now, if you've ever made a snowman, you know that rolling
a large ball is not easy. Now picture trying to make that snowman when the ball of snow is as big as you are and you're standing on your head. (Laughter) Sahara desert ants
are navigation specialists. They might have to wander a considerable
distance to forage for food. But once they do find sustenance, they know how to calculate
the straightest path home. And the dragonfly is a hunting specialist. In the wild, dragonflies capture
approximately 95 percent of the prey they choose to go after. These insects are so good
at their specialties that neuroscientists such as myself
study them as model systems to understand how animal nervous systems
solve particular problems. And in my own research, I study brains
to bring these solutions, the best that biology
has to offer, to computers. So consider the dragonfly brain. It has only on the order
of one million neurons. Now, it's still not easy to unravel
a circuit of even one million neurons. But given the choice between trying to tease apart
the one-million-neuron brain versus the 86-billion-neuron brain, which would you choose to try first? (Laughter) When studying these smaller insect brains, the immediate goal
is not human intelligence. We study these brains
for what the insects do well. And in the case of the dragonfly,
that's interception. So when dragonflies are hunting, they do more than just fly
straight at the prey. They fly in such a way
that they will intercept it. They aim for where
the prey is going to be. Much like a soccer player,
running to intercept a pass. To do this correctly, dragonflies need to perform what is known
as a coordinate transformation, going from the eye’s frame of reference,
or what the dragonfly sees, to the body's frame of reference, or how the dragonfly needs
to turn its body to intercept. Coordinate transformations
are a basic calculation that animals need to perform
to interact with the world. We do them instinctively
every time we reach for something. When I reach for an object
straight in front of me, my arm takes a very different trajectory
than if I turn my head, look at that same object
when it is off to one side and reach for it there. In both cases, my eyes see
the same image of that object, but my brain is sending my arm
on a very different trajectory based on the position of my neck. And dragonflies are fast. This means they calculate fast. The latency, or the time it takes
for a dragonfly to respond once it sees the prey turn, is about 50 milliseconds. This latency is remarkable. For one thing, it's only half
the time of a human eye blink. But for another thing, it suggests that dragonflies
capture how to intercept in only relatively or surprisingly
few computational steps. So in the brain, a computational step is a single neuron or a layer of neurons working in parallel. It takes a single neuron
about 10 milliseconds to add up all its inputs and respond. The 50-millisecond response time means that once the dragonfly
sees its prey turn, there's only time for maybe four
of these computational steps or four layers of neurons,
working in sequence, one after the other, to calculate how
the dragonfly needs to turn. In other words, if I want to study how the dragonfly does
coordinate transformations, the neural circuit
that I need to understand, the neural circuit that I need to study, can have at most four layers of neurons. Each layer may have many neurons, but this is a small neural circuit. Small enough that we can identify it and study it with the tools
that are available today. And this is what I'm trying to do. I have built a model of what I believe
is the neural circuit that calculates how
the dragonfly should turn. And here is the cool result. In the model, dragonflies do coordinate transformations
in only one computational step, one layer of neurons. This is something
we can test and understand. In a computer simulation, I can predict the activities
of individual neurons while the dragonfly is hunting. For example, here I am predicting
the action potentials, or the spikes, that are fired by one of these neurons when the dragonfly sees the prey move. To test the model, my collaborators and I are now comparing
these predicted neural responses with responses of neurons
recorded in living dragonfly brains. These are ongoing experiments in which we put living dragonflies
in virtual reality. (Laughter) Now, it's not practical to put
VR goggles on a dragonfly. So instead, we show movies
of moving targets to the dragonfly, while an electrode records activity
patterns of individual neurons in the brain. Yeah, he likes the movies. If the responses
that we record in the brain match those predicted by the model, we will have identified
which neurons are responsible for coordinate transformations. The next step will be
to understand the specifics of how these neurons work together
to do the calculation. But this is how we begin to understand
how brains do basic or primitive calculations. Calculations that I regard as building
blocks for more complex functions, not only for interception
but also for cognition. The way that these neurons compute
may be different from anything that exists on a computer today. And the goal of this work
is to do more than just write code that replicates the activity
patterns of neurons. We aim to build a computer chip that not only does the same things
as biological brains but does them in the same way
as biological brains. This could lead to drones
driven by computers the same size of the dragonfly's brain that captures some targets
and avoid others. Personally, I'm hoping
for a small army of these to defend my backyard
from mosquitoes in the summer. (Laughter) The GPS on your phone could be replaced
by a new navigation device based on dung beetles or ants that could guide you to the straight
or the easy path home. And what would the power requirements
of these devices be like? As small as it is -- Or, sorry -- as large as it is, the human brain is estimated
to have the same power requirements as a 20-watt light bulb. Imagine if all brain-inspired computers had the same extremely
low-power requirements. Your smartphone or your smartwatch
probably needs charging every day. Your new brain-inspired device might only
need charging every few months, or maybe even every few years. The famous physicist,
Richard Feynman, once said, "What I cannot create,
I do not understand." What I see in insect nervous systems is an opportunity to understand brains through the creation of computers
that work as brains do. And creation of these computers
will not just be for knowledge. There's potential for real impact
on your devices, your vehicles, maybe even artificial intelligences. So next time you see an insect, consider that these tiny brains
can lead to remarkable computers. And think of the potential
that they offer us for the future. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Creating intelligence on a computer. This has been the Holy Grail
for artificial intelligence for quite some time. But how do we get there? So we view ourselves as highly
intelligent beings. So it's logical to study our own brains, the substrate of our cognition,
for creating artificial intelligence. Imagine if we could replicate
how our own brains work on a computer. But now consider the journey
that would be required. The human brain contains
86 billion neurons. Each is constantly communicating
with thousands of others, and each has individual
characteristics of its own. Capturing the human brain on a computer may simply be too big
and too complex a problem to tackle with the technology
and the knowledge that we have today. I believe that we can capture
a brain on a computer, but we have to start smaller. Much smaller. These insects have three of the most
fascinating brains in the world to me. While they do not possess
human-level intelligence, each is remarkable at a particular task. Think of them as highly
trained specialists. African dung beetles are really good
at rolling large balls in straight lines. (Laughter) Now, if you've ever made a snowman, you know that rolling
a large ball is not easy. Now picture trying to make that snowman when the ball of snow is as big as you are and you're standing on your head. (Laughter) Sahara desert ants
are navigation specialists. They might have to wander a considerable
distance to forage for food. But once they do find sustenance, they know how to calculate
the straightest path home. And the dragonfly is a hunting specialist. In the wild, dragonflies capture
approximately 95 percent of the prey they choose to go after. These insects are so good
at their specialties that neuroscientists such as myself
study them as model systems to understand how animal nervous systems
solve particular problems. And in my own research, I study brains
to bring these solutions, the best that biology
has to offer, to computers. So consider the dragonfly brain. It has only on the order
of one million neurons. Now, it's still not easy to unravel
a circuit of even one million neurons. But given the choice between trying to tease apart
the one-million-neuron brain versus the 86-billion-neuron brain, which would you choose to try first? (Laughter) When studying these smaller insect brains, the immediate goal
is not human intelligence. We study these brains
for what the insects do well. And in the case of the dragonfly,
that's interception. So when dragonflies are hunting, they do more than just fly
straight at the prey. They fly in such a way
that they will intercept it. They aim for where
the prey is going to be. Much like a soccer player,
running to intercept a pass. To do this correctly, dragonflies need to perform what is known
as a coordinate transformation, going from the eye’s frame of reference,
or what the dragonfly sees, to the body's frame of reference, or how the dragonfly needs
to turn its body to intercept. Coordinate transformations
are a basic calculation that animals need to perform
to interact with the world. We do them instinctively
every time we reach for something. When I reach for an object
straight in front of me, my arm takes a very different trajectory
than if I turn my head, look at that same object
when it is off to one side and reach for it there. In both cases, my eyes see
the same image of that object, but my brain is sending my arm
on a very different trajectory based on the position of my neck. And dragonflies are fast. This means they calculate fast. The latency, or the time it takes
for a dragonfly to respond once it sees the prey turn, is about 50 milliseconds. This latency is remarkable. For one thing, it's only half

**Transcript**:
Odin, the king of Asgard, 
was plagued by nightmares. Three fearsome figures haunted his dreams: a massive, writhing shadow; a shambling, rotting corpse; and worst of all, 
a monstrous beast with a deadly bite. Night after night, the creatures
besieged the king. And although their true forms
were unknown to him, he could tell they were related 
to Asgard’s most persistent problem: Loki. Despite having settled down
with his wife and sons, Loki had been sneaking off to visit 
the giantess Angrboda. And when the king learned this affair
had produced three children, he was filled with unease. Odin summoned Thor and Tyr, 
two of his bravest warriors, to travel to Jotunheim to capture 
Loki’s secret children. Upon arriving at Angrboda’s home, the pair were immediately accosted
by Loki's first child, a serpent named Jörmungandr. The God of Thunder dodged 
the snake’s venom and swiftly bound him to a pine tree. The second child, Hel, appeared as 
a glowing young woman from the right and a moldering corpse from the left. Her flesh flaked onto the ground 
as she silently submitted to her captors. Finally, the third child leapt at Tyr. The small wolf was fierce but harmless. Tyr playfully cuffed its claws 
and stowed the cub in his pocket. Back in Asgard, the warriors
presented their prisoners and fearful recognition
seized Odin's heart. Though these three were meager reflections
of his dark dreams, the king was determined to dispose 
of them before his visions came true. First, he banished Jörmungandr 
to the sea at the edge of the world. Then he sent Hel deep below the earth
to join her fellow corpses. But the wolf, named Fenrir, 
presented a challenge. He’d already grown strong
enough to threaten the gods, so Odin took a more patient approach. For months, he supervised the creature,
watching Fenrir grow from a cub to a wolf to a beast 
who spoke with the voice of a God. Tyr visited frequently and found Fenrir
to be strong and clever. But as their bond deepened,
Odin's fear only grew. One day, Odin forged his heaviest chains and hauled them to Fenrir 
with a challenge. He would bind the wolf
to test his growing strength. Fenrir eagerly accepted the challenge 
and splintered the metal like old wood. Odin returned to the forge, crafting
shackles that no man could lift alone. These sturdy chains gave Fenrir pause. But with an encouraging wink from Tyr,
he accepted the challenge. The beast strained for a moment 
and then shattered his restraints into a thousand pieces. Desperate, Odin sought help 
from the most skilled makers of all: the Dwarves. Rather than metal, they sought 
the rarest ingredients; from feline footsteps and fish breath to the sinews of mountains 
and mighty bears. With these, the Dwarves crafted Gleipnir, an unbreakable chain in the guise 
of fine thread. When Odin challenged Fenrir a third time, 
the wolf laughed. But as he examined the thread 
more closely, Fenrir sensed Odin’s trickery 
and began to feel some fear himself. Fenrir struck a deal. He would accept the challenge, but only if a god kept their hand 
in his mouth throughout. With a heavy heart, Tyr volunteered. The gods bound the wolf and as he strained
Gleipnir only grew tighter. Fenrir felt the agony of betrayal— not only from Odin,
but from his reluctant friend. With a howl of fury, 
he bit through Tyr’s wrist and vowed to destroy Odin 
for tricking him. Watching his nightmare come to life, Odin thrust Tyr’s blade
between Fenrir jaws, releasing a torrent of saliva 
that became a furious river. While the beast was not dead, 
he was bound, and Odin celebrated his victory over fate. But in truth, his actions had
only sealed his doom. Beneath the waves, 
Jörmungandr grew to encircle the world. Hel rose to rule the dead
as queen of the Underworld. And every day, Fenrir strained 
a little more against his chains, inching ever closer to his bloody revenge.

**Transcript**:
Odin, the king of Asgard, 
was plagued by nightmares. Three fearsome figures haunted his dreams: a massive, writhing shadow; a shambling, rotting corpse; and worst of all, 
a monstrous beast with a deadly bite. Night after night, the creatures
besieged the king. And although their true forms
were unknown to him, he could tell they were related 
to Asgard’s most persistent problem: Loki. Despite having settled down
with his wife and sons, Loki had been sneaking off to visit 
the giantess Angrboda. And when the king learned this affair
had produced three children, he was filled with unease. Odin summoned Thor and Tyr, 
two of his bravest warriors, to travel to Jotunheim to capture 
Loki’s secret children. Upon arriving at Angrboda’s home, the pair were immediately accosted
by Loki's first child, a serpent named Jörmungandr. The God of Thunder dodged 
the snake’s venom and swiftly bound him to a pine tree. The second child, Hel, appeared as 
a glowing young woman from the right and a moldering corpse from the left. Her flesh flaked onto the ground 
as she silently submitted to her captors. Finally, the third child leapt at Tyr. The small wolf was fierce but harmless. Tyr playfully cuffed its claws 
and stowed the cub in his pocket. Back in Asgard, the warriors
presented their prisoners and fearful recognition
seized Odin's heart. Though these three were meager reflections
of his dark dreams, the king was determined to dispose 
of them before his visions came true. First, he banished Jörmungandr 
to the sea at the edge of the world. Then he sent Hel deep below the earth
to join her fellow corpses. But the wolf, named Fenrir, 
presented a challenge. He’d already grown strong
enough to threaten the gods, so Odin took a more patient approach. For months, he supervised the creature,
watching Fenrir grow from a cub to a wolf to a beast 
who spoke with the voice of a God. Tyr visited frequently and found Fenrir
to be strong and clever. But as their bond deepened,
Odin's fear only grew. One day, Odin forged his heaviest chains and hauled them to Fenrir 
with a challenge. He would bind the wolf
to test his growing strength. Fenrir eagerly accepted the challenge 
and splintered the metal like old wood. Odin returned to the forge, crafting
shackles that no man could lift alone. These sturdy chains gave Fenrir pause. But with an encouraging wink from Tyr,
he accepted the challenge. The beast strained for a moment 
and then shattered his restraints into a thousand pieces. Desperate, Odin sought help 
from the most skilled makers of all: the Dwarves. Rather than metal, they sought 
the rarest ingredients; from feline footsteps and fish breath to the sinews of mountains 
and mighty bears. With these, the Dwarves crafted Gleipnir, an unbreakable chain in the guise 
of fine thread. When Odin challenged Fenrir a third time, 
the wolf laughed. But as he examined the thread 
more closely, Fenrir sensed Odin’s trickery 
and began to feel some fear himself. Fenrir struck a deal. He would accept the challenge, but only if a god kept their hand 
in his mouth throughout. With a heavy heart, Tyr volunteered. The gods bound the wolf and as he strained
Gleipnir only grew tighter. Fenrir felt the agony of betrayal— not only from Odin,
but from his reluctant friend. With a howl of fury, 
he bit through Tyr’s wrist and vowed to destroy Odin 
for tricking him. Watching his nightmare come to life, Odin thrust Tyr’s blade
between Fenrir jaws, releasing a torrent of saliva 
that became a furious river. While the beast was not dead, 
he was bound, and Odin celebrated his victory over fate. But in truth, his actions had
only sealed his doom. Beneath the waves, 
Jörmungandr grew to encircle the world. Hel rose to rule the dead
as queen of the Underworld. And every day, Fenrir strained 
a little more against his chains, inching ever closer to his bloody revenge.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Baritone thunder. Snarling winds. 
Consuming downpours. Okeechobee, the disastrous hurricane 
of 1928, tore through the North Atlantic basin,
laying waste to entire communities. In Eatonville, Florida, 
the storm forced many to flee. But for Janie Crawford, 
it inspired an unexpected homecoming. Janie’s return begins 
“Their Eyes Were Watching God,” Zora Neale Hurston’s acclaimed novel about a Black woman’s quest 
for love and agency in a time that sought to deprive 
her of both. When Janie arrives back in Eatonville,
her arrival is shrouded in mystery. Her neighbors and friends are quick
to gossip about her reappearance, her finances, and most importantly, 
the whereabouts of her missing husband. But only Janie’s friend Pheoby
gets to hear the whole story. Over the course of a conversation 
that spans most of the novel, Hurston untangles Janie’s life story; from her complicated childhood 
and her life in Eatonville, to her scandalous departure 
and the shocking events that followed. The specifics of Janie’s story
are often larger than life, but many of the book’s details reflect 
the incredible experiences of its author. Zora Neale Hurston was
raised in Eatonville, one of the first planned and incorporated
all-Black communities in America. Like Janie, she also left
Eatonville abruptly, traveling first to Jacksonville and DC,
before eventually moving further north. In New York City, 
Hurston studied anthropology and became a renowned author 
in the Harlem Renaissance, a cultural, literary and artistic movement
that’s still considered a golden era of Black artistry and creativity. Here, her work garnered enough support 
to fund research trips through the South, where she collected stories and folktales
from Black Americans. By 1937, her fieldwork had taken
her all the way to Haiti, where she wrote most 
of “Their Eyes Were Watching God.” Hurston drew on all these experiences
for the novel, incorporating folkloric elements alongside
her own family and romantic history to bring readers into the intimate spaces 
of Black southern life. She uses regional phrases and sayings to capture the dialect 
of her Floridian characters. And the novel’s omniscient 
third-person narration allows Hurston to unleash 
her poetic prose on everything from birdsong, architecture, and fashion, to her characters’ deepest feelings 
and motivations. Perhaps more than any specific details, Hurston’s experiences of being 
a Black woman in America at this time are more evident in the novel’s themes. Over the course of one long evening, Janie and Pheoby discuss the nature of
family, marriage, spirituality and more. But their conversation always comes back
to Janie’s truest desire: to live honestly 
and be truly loved in return. As a teenager, Janie resents 
an arranged marriage, despite the safety it offers her 
and the wishes of her loving grandmother. When her family becomes well-respected 
in Eatonville, she struggles with the
judgmental eyes of strangers and a husband who wants her 
to be something she’s not. Throughout her life, Janie frequently
feels she’s at the whim of natural and spiritual forces that can shift the course of her existence
without warning. And when she finally does find true love, these unknowable powers 
continue to act on her, threatening to destroy the life
she's so painstakingly built. The story takes place during a time where
women had little to no agency, and Janie’s life is full 
of complicated characters who demand different kinds 
of love and submission. But despite the loneliness 
of her situation, Janie navigates these trials 
with defiance and curiosity. Her questions and commentary 
push back in subtle, clever ways. And as the reader follows Janie’s journey
from childhood to middle age, her confidence becomes infectious. Just like Hurston, Janie defies 
the restrictive expectations for a woman in her time. Early in the novel, Hurston writes that “there are years that ask questions
and years that answer,” suggesting that life can only truly 
be understood by living it. But through her empathetic storytelling, Hurston invites us into Janie’s life, 
her life, and the lives of so many other women.

of love and submission. But despite the loneliness 
of her situation, Janie navigates these trials 
with defiance and curiosity. Her questions and commentary 
push back in subtle, clever ways. And as the reader follows Janie’s journey
from childhood to middle age, her confidence becomes infectious. Just like Hurston, Janie defies 
the restrictive expectations for a woman in her time. Early in the novel, Hurston writes that “there are years that ask questions
and years that answer,” suggesting that life can only truly 
be understood by living it. But through her empathetic storytelling, Hurston invites us into Janie’s life, 
her life, and the lives of so many other women.

**Transcript**:
Baritone thunder. Snarling winds. 
Consuming downpours. Okeechobee, the disastrous hurricane 
of 1928, tore through the North Atlantic basin,
laying waste to entire communities. In Eatonville, Florida, 
the storm forced many to flee. But for Janie Crawford, 
it inspired an unexpected homecoming. Janie’s return begins 
“Their Eyes Were Watching God,” Zora Neale Hurston’s acclaimed novel about a Black woman’s quest 
for love and agency in a time that sought to deprive 
her of both. When Janie arrives back in Eatonville,
her arrival is shrouded in mystery. Her neighbors and friends are quick
to gossip about her reappearance, her finances, and most importantly, 
the whereabouts of her missing husband. But only Janie’s friend Pheoby
gets to hear the whole story. Over the course of a conversation 
that spans most of the novel, Hurston untangles Janie’s life story; from her complicated childhood 
and her life in Eatonville, to her scandalous departure 
and the shocking events that followed. The specifics of Janie’s story
are often larger than life, but many of the book’s details reflect 
the incredible experiences of its author. Zora Neale Hurston was
raised in Eatonville, one of the first planned and incorporated
all-Black communities in America. Like Janie, she also left
Eatonville abruptly, traveling first to Jacksonville and DC,
before eventually moving further north. In New York City, 
Hurston studied anthropology and became a renowned author 
in the Harlem Renaissance, a cultural, literary and artistic movement
that’s still considered a golden era of Black artistry and creativity. Here, her work garnered enough support 
to fund research trips through the South, where she collected stories and folktales
from Black Americans. By 1937, her fieldwork had taken
her all the way to Haiti, where she wrote most 
of “Their Eyes Were Watching God.” Hurston drew on all these experiences
for the novel, incorporating folkloric elements alongside
her own family and romantic history to bring readers into the intimate spaces 
of Black southern life. She uses regional phrases and sayings to capture the dialect 
of her Floridian characters. And the novel’s omniscient 
third-person narration allows Hurston to unleash 
her poetic prose on everything from birdsong, architecture, and fashion, to her characters’ deepest feelings 
and motivations. Perhaps more than any specific details, Hurston’s experiences of being 
a Black woman in America at this time are more evident in the novel’s themes. Over the course of one long evening, Janie and Pheoby discuss the nature of
family, marriage, spirituality and more. But their conversation always comes back
to Janie’s truest desire: to live honestly 
and be truly loved in return. As a teenager, Janie resents 
an arranged marriage, despite the safety it offers her 
and the wishes of her loving grandmother. When her family becomes well-respected 
in Eatonville, she struggles with the
judgmental eyes of strangers and a husband who wants her 
to be something she’s not. Throughout her life, Janie frequently
feels she’s at the whim of natural and spiritual forces that can shift the course of her existence
without warning. And when she finally does find true love, these unknowable powers 
continue to act on her, threatening to destroy the life
she's so painstakingly built. The story takes place during a time where
women had little to no agency, and Janie’s life is full 
of complicated characters who demand different kinds 
of love and submission. But despite the loneliness

**Transcript**:
In 1776, a powerful empire was
born in North America. The Lakotas had reached the Black Hills, the most sacred place and most coveted
buffalo hunting grounds in the western plains. Located in what is now South Dakota, 
control of the Black Hills, or Paha Sapa, marked the Lakotas as the dominant power
in the American West. Just a few decades before, they were vying
for power in the eastern woodlands— and losing. One of seven nations, 
or seven council fires, that made up the Sioux Alliance, the Lakotas had lived in the forests
and wetlands between the Great Lakes 
and the Missouri Valley for centuries. In the 1600s, European colonizers
destabilized this region. While some tribes profited by trading
furs with new France, the Lakotas lived just out of range
of the best trade opportunities. So in the early 1700s,
they turned their attention west. The western plains were much less fertile
and abundant than the Lakotas’ homelands. The only easy access to food and water
was immediately alongside the rivers— land Arikaras had already claimed. To compete, the Lakotas became 
skilled buffalo hunters and warriors on horseback. They conquered the farming Arikaras, forcing them to pay tributes
of maize and squash. When the Spanish arrived expecting
to find lucrative trading grounds, they had to pay tolls 
to the Lakotas instead. In 1804, a new spectacle came floating
up the Missouri River: Merriwether Lewis and William Clark. Lakota chief Black Buffalo refused to let
them pass until they paid a hefty tribute. In spite of this rocky start, the expedition marked the beginning
of a close trade alliance between the Lakotas and the United States. Lakota men hunted buffalo, while women
processed the hides into robes for trade. The US government supplied guns,
ammunition, and other goods, even providing Lakotas with smallpox
vaccines that protected them from the deadly epidemics that ravaged
other Native American nations. On paper, the United States had acquired
the Lakotas’ lands from France in the Louisiana Purchase. But the Lakotas would not cede their lands because of an agreement 
between two foreign powers. Though there were 15,000 Lakotas
and 23 million Americans, the bulk of US population and military
might was concentrated on the east coast. Just getting an army to Lakota territory
presented a huge expense, and once there they would face 
formidable warriors with deep local knowledge and alliances. To avoid a war it couldn’t afford 
and wouldn’t win, the US government attempted to appease 
the Lakotas, paying steep tributes of ammunition 
and rations demanded by Lakota leaders. So while almost all the Native Americans
in North America were being forced off their lands 
and onto reservations, the Lakota Empire was still expanding. By 1850, they controlled 
some 500,000 square kilometers. They were spread thinly
across this vast area, moving their villages 
in pursuit of Buffalo. Though there was no central authority, the leaders of bands, or oyates, 
came together at annual Sun Dances to strategize and coordinate complex
diplomatic operations. Lasting a few weeks each summer, Sun Dances were spiritual ceremonies 
that reaffirmed communal ties, appeased Wakan Tanka, the Great Spirit,
and kept the world in balance. Starting in 1849, the California gold rush
brought hordes of white settlers west, encroaching on Lakota territory
and disturbing the buffalo herds. Lakota leaders correctly interpreted
this migration as a signal that the US no longer intended 
to respect their claim to the land. In retaliation, they attacked wagon trains
and government offices. As the conflict grew, Chief Red Cloud
negotiated in Washington DC. While back in Lakota territory, chiefs 
Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and others prepared for battle. They mobilized their Cheyenne 
and Arapaho allies and almost all the other Sioux nations 
against the US. In 1876, exactly 100 years after
the Lakotas’ arrival, gold prospectors occupied 
the sacred Black Hills. For many Lakotas, 
this was the final straw. Following a vision by Sitting Bull, 
Crazy Horse led Lakota forces to decisively defeat the Americans 
in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. After this victory, the Lakotas
faced an even graver threat: wagon travel and railroad construction
had decimated buffalo populations, and they faced starvation. To survive, they moved on to reservations, where the authorities murdered 
Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse and attempted to dismantle their culture, 
prohibiting the Sun Dance on reservations. The Lakotas started a protest movement
called the Ghost Dance. Alarmed by this resistance, in 1890,
the US Army massacred hundreds of Lakotas, many of them women and children,
at Wounded Knee Creek. Today, Lakotas continue to fight 
for their culture and their land. In 2016, they drew supporters worldwide
to protest construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline 
through their reservation, continuing a long history of resistance to a government
known for breaking its promises.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1776, a powerful empire was
born in North America. The Lakotas had reached the Black Hills, the most sacred place and most coveted
buffalo hunting grounds in the western plains. Located in what is now South Dakota, 
control of the Black Hills, or Paha Sapa, marked the Lakotas as the dominant power
in the American West. Just a few decades before, they were vying
for power in the eastern woodlands— and losing. One of seven nations, 
or seven council fires, that made up the Sioux Alliance, the Lakotas had lived in the forests
and wetlands between the Great Lakes 
and the Missouri Valley for centuries. In the 1600s, European colonizers
destabilized this region. While some tribes profited by trading
furs with new France, the Lakotas lived just out of range
of the best trade opportunities. So in the early 1700s,
they turned their attention west. The western plains were much less fertile
and abundant than the Lakotas’ homelands. The only easy access to food and water
was immediately alongside the rivers— land Arikaras had already claimed. To compete, the Lakotas became 
skilled buffalo hunters and warriors on horseback. They conquered the farming Arikaras, forcing them to pay tributes
of maize and squash. When the Spanish arrived expecting
to find lucrative trading grounds, they had to pay tolls 
to the Lakotas instead. In 1804, a new spectacle came floating
up the Missouri River: Merriwether Lewis and William Clark. Lakota chief Black Buffalo refused to let
them pass until they paid a hefty tribute. In spite of this rocky start, the expedition marked the beginning
of a close trade alliance between the Lakotas and the United States. Lakota men hunted buffalo, while women
processed the hides into robes for trade. The US government supplied guns,
ammunition, and other goods, even providing Lakotas with smallpox
vaccines that protected them from the deadly epidemics that ravaged
other Native American nations. On paper, the United States had acquired
the Lakotas’ lands from France in the Louisiana Purchase. But the Lakotas would not cede their lands because of an agreement 
between two foreign powers. Though there were 15,000 Lakotas
and 23 million Americans, the bulk of US population and military
might was concentrated on the east coast. Just getting an army to Lakota territory
presented a huge expense, and once there they would face 
formidable warriors with deep local knowledge and alliances. To avoid a war it couldn’t afford 
and wouldn’t win, the US government attempted to appease 
the Lakotas, paying steep tributes of ammunition 
and rations demanded by Lakota leaders. So while almost all the Native Americans
in North America were being forced off their lands 
and onto reservations, the Lakota Empire was still expanding. By 1850, they controlled 
some 500,000 square kilometers. They were spread thinly
across this vast area, moving their villages 
in pursuit of Buffalo. Though there was no central authority, the leaders of bands, or oyates, 
came together at annual Sun Dances to strategize and coordinate complex
diplomatic operations. Lasting a few weeks each summer, Sun Dances were spiritual ceremonies 
that reaffirmed communal ties, appeased Wakan Tanka, the Great Spirit,
and kept the world in balance. Starting in 1849, the California gold rush
brought hordes of white settlers west, encroaching on Lakota territory
and disturbing the buffalo herds. Lakota leaders correctly interpreted
this migration as a signal that the US no longer intended 
to respect their claim to the land. In retaliation, they attacked wagon trains
and government offices. As the conflict grew, Chief Red Cloud
negotiated in Washington DC. While back in Lakota territory, chiefs 
Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and others prepared for battle. They mobilized their Cheyenne 
and Arapaho allies and almost all the other Sioux nations 
against the US. In 1876, exactly 100 years after
the Lakotas’ arrival, gold prospectors occupied 
the sacred Black Hills. For many Lakotas, 
this was the final straw. Following a vision by Sitting Bull, 
Crazy Horse led Lakota forces to decisively defeat the Americans 
in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. After this victory, the Lakotas
faced an even graver threat: wagon travel and railroad construction
had decimated buffalo populations, and they faced starvation. To survive, they moved on to reservations, where the authorities murdered 
Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse and attempted to dismantle their culture, 
prohibiting the Sun Dance on reservations. The Lakotas started a protest movement
called the Ghost Dance. Alarmed by this resistance, in 1890,
the US Army massacred hundreds of Lakotas, many of them women and children,
at Wounded Knee Creek. Today, Lakotas continue to fight 
for their culture and their land. In 2016, they drew supporters worldwide
to protest construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline 
through their reservation, continuing a long history of resistance to a government
known for breaking its promises.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Joseph Geni
Reviewer: Morton Bast So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s. When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid. But my tiger mother said, "No." My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them. After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness: a safe and well-paid job. It is not important if I like the job or not. But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer. That is me playing my imaginary piano. An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics, so I tried everything I could to go to opera school. I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show. But no adults liked the idea. No adults believed I was serious. Only my friends supported me, but they were kids, just as powerless as I was. So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained. My dream would never come true. I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for. But that's so unfair. So I was determined to find another calling. Nobody around to teach me? Fine. I turned to books. I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"] I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"] And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"] And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these. ["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin] I came to the U.S. in 1995, so which books did I read here first? Books banned in China, of course. "The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life. That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it. The Bible is interesting, but strange. (Laughter) That's a topic for a different day. But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany: "You shall honor your father and mother." "Honor," I said. "That's so different, and better, than obey." So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents. Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading. It offers many insights. For example, I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with. It had never occurred to me, China doesn't have to be at the center of the world. A map actually carries somebody's view. Comparative reading actually is nothing new. It's a standard practice in the academic world. There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature. Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic. So I thought, well, if comparative reading works for research, why not do it in daily life too? So I started reading books in pairs. So they can be about people -- ["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] -- who are involved in the same event, or friends with shared experiences. ["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder] I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter) [Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] -- or similar stories from different cultures, as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell] For example, both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations. For the Christ, the temptations are economic, political and spiritual. For the Buddha, they are all psychological: lust, fear and social duty -- interesting. So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages. ["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts] Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain. For example, it's through translation that I realized "happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh! "Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh. (Laughter) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present. I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again. Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered. I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream. Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from. Even a shattered dream can do that for you. So because of books, I'm here today, happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity, most of the time. So may books be always with you. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
“Dictionary:” noun, 
“a malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language 
and making it hard and inelastic.” “Lexicographer:” noun, “a writer 
of dictionaries; a harmless drudge.” While the concept of a dictionary 
dates back to ancient civilizations, the first English dictionary was published
by Robert Cawdrey in 1604. In the centuries that followed, many more dictionaries were written 
by individual authors who chose what to include or exclude. They not only defined words, they openly 
showcased their creators’ opinions— like Ambrose Bierce’s definition
of “dictionary” and Samuel Johnson’s definition
of “lexicographer.” After their authors deaths, many of these
dictionaries quickly became outdated. But one 19th century dictionary
had a different fate. In 1828, American lawyer and author
Noah Webster published “An American Dictionary of the 
English Language” with a lofty goal: to give the United States its own version
of the English language. He believed that as a new nation, the United States needed its own distinct
version of English to assert its independence from Britain. In his dictionary, Webster sought 
to describe and officialize the way Americans spoke. Most dictionaries in Webster’s time 
were prescriptive: they dictated how words should be used, rather than documenting the way people 
actually used language in daily life. When Webster broke this convention and 
included slang words in his dictionary, critics accused him of polluting
the English language. But he argued that these words captured
local variations of language— a vital part of what made
American English unique. He also believed spelling rules
were unnecessarily complex, and that we should write the way
we speak as much as possible. Still, Webster’s own opinions influenced
the words he included and the way he defined them. He excluded slang words 
from Black communities because he didn’t consider them proper. And when he defined “woman,” he added that “women are soft, 
mild, pitiful, and flexible.” By the time of his death, 
Noah Webster was a household name. Seeing a lucrative business opportunity, brothers George and Charles Merriam bought
the rights to Webster’s Dictionary. Together with Webster’s son-in-law, 
the Merriams made a new, revised edition. It was the beginning 
of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Today, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary
begins to address a contradiction in Webster’s goal: he wanted to represent an entire nation, but he based his work on just one person’s
opinion: his own. Since Webster’s death, each new edition
of the dictionary has been curated by a group of language experts rather
than by a single authority. The current criteria for
including a word in the dictionary are that it has “widespread,
sustained, and meaningful use.” This clearly includes profanities, which were sometimes excluded 
from dictionaries in the past. Racial slurs also meet
the criteria for inclusion, but some argue that including
them might legitimize them. Dictionaries don’t just add new words— they also redefine old words to reflect
changing attitudes and usage. One 1736 dictionary defined “wife”
as “a married woman whose will, in the judgment of the law, is subject
to the will of her husband: for which reason a wife is
said to have no will.” Today, “wife” is defined simply as 
“a female partner in a marriage.” In 2019, Merriam-Webster’s word
of the year was “they.” The word has been in regular
use for centuries, but has only recently gained a new
recognized meaning, as a pronoun for one person whose 
gender identity is nonbinary. The question of which words belong 
in the dictionary impacts all of us— when our words and definitions 
are represented, they’re affirmed; if not, they— and we— are minimized. Today, lexicographers have expanded 
word sourcing to include the dictionary’s users:
tracking which words are most searched, and adding them to the dictionary. So, who decides what’s in the dictionary? More than ever before the answer is: 
we do. All of us shape language every day. When we collectively embrace one word 
or redefine another, eventually, those words and meanings
are reflected in our dictionaries.

dictionaries quickly became outdated. But one 19th century dictionary
had a different fate. In 1828, American lawyer and author
Noah Webster published “An American Dictionary of the 
English Language” with a lofty goal: to give the United States its own version
of the English language. He believed that as a new nation, the United States needed its own distinct
version of English to assert its independence from Britain. In his dictionary, Webster sought 
to describe and officialize the way Americans spoke. Most dictionaries in Webster’s time 
were prescriptive: they dictated how words should be used, rather than documenting the way people 
actually used language in daily life. When Webster broke this convention and 
included slang words in his dictionary, critics accused him of polluting
the English language. But he argued that these words captured
local variations of language— a vital part of what made
American English unique. He also believed spelling rules
were unnecessarily complex, and that we should write the way
we speak as much as possible. Still, Webster’s own opinions influenced
the words he included and the way he defined them. He excluded slang words 
from Black communities because he didn’t consider them proper. And when he defined “woman,” he added that “women are soft, 
mild, pitiful, and flexible.” By the time of his death, 
Noah Webster was a household name. Seeing a lucrative business opportunity, brothers George and Charles Merriam bought
the rights to Webster’s Dictionary. Together with Webster’s son-in-law, 
the Merriams made a new, revised edition. It was the beginning 
of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Today, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary
begins to address a contradiction in Webster’s goal: he wanted to represent an entire nation, but he based his work on just one person’s
opinion: his own. Since Webster’s death, each new edition
of the dictionary has been curated by a group of language experts rather
than by a single authority. The current criteria for
including a word in the dictionary are that it has “widespread,
sustained, and meaningful use.” This clearly includes profanities, which were sometimes excluded 
from dictionaries in the past. Racial slurs also meet
the criteria for inclusion, but some argue that including
them might legitimize them. Dictionaries don’t just add new words— they also redefine old words to reflect
changing attitudes and usage. One 1736 dictionary defined “wife”
as “a married woman whose will, in the judgment of the law, is subject
to the will of her husband: for which reason a wife is
said to have no will.” Today, “wife” is defined simply as 
“a female partner in a marriage.” In 2019, Merriam-Webster’s word
of the year was “they.” The word has been in regular
use for centuries, but has only recently gained a new
recognized meaning, as a pronoun for one person whose 
gender identity is nonbinary. The question of which words belong 
in the dictionary impacts all of us— when our words and definitions 
are represented, they’re affirmed; if not, they— and we— are minimized. Today, lexicographers have expanded 
word sourcing to include the dictionary’s users:
tracking which words are most searched, and adding them to the dictionary. So, who decides what’s in the dictionary? More than ever before the answer is: 
we do. All of us shape language every day. When we collectively embrace one word 
or redefine another, eventually, those words and meanings
are reflected in our dictionaries.

“Dictionary:” noun, 
“a malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language 
and making it hard and inelastic.” “Lexicographer:” noun, “a writer 
of dictionaries; a harmless drudge.” While the concept of a dictionary 
dates back to ancient civilizations, the first English dictionary was published
by Robert Cawdrey in 1604. In the centuries that followed, many more dictionaries were written 
by individual authors who chose what to include or exclude. They not only defined words, they openly 
showcased their creators’ opinions— like Ambrose Bierce’s definition
of “dictionary” and Samuel Johnson’s definition
of “lexicographer.” After their authors deaths, many of these
dictionaries quickly became outdated. But one 19th century dictionary
had a different fate. In 1828, American lawyer and author

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the middle of the 19th century, the California gold rush brought thousands
of settlers to America’s west coast. But finding gold may have been easier 
than transporting it back east. The only hope for avoiding 
a grueling six month wagon journey was to travel the narrowest portion 
of the continent— the 48-kilometer Isthmus of Panama. By 1855, a railroad spanning the region
significantly shortened to the trip, but unloading and reloading ships
at each port cost time and money. To truly connect these two bodies of water
shipping interests needed a canal— a continuous maritime passage
through the isthmus. The first attempt at this colossal
construction project was taken up in 1881 by French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps. De Lesseps had supervised construction
of Egypt's Suez Canal, but his success made him overconfident. He insisted on digging the canal 
at sea level, even though it required boring 
directly through the Continental Divide mountain range. Futile excavation efforts were buried
under constant landslides. And since the diplomat had only 
visited the site briefly during Panama’s dry season, his workers were unprepared for 
torrential storms, venomous jungle fauna, and tropical diseases. After spending $287 million 
and losing a staggering 22,000 lives, the French abandoned the project. The United States had been considering
building a canal through Nicaragua, but at this point, the chance to succeed
where France failed was tempting. Panamanian leaders were also eager 
to complete a canal which would bring their country
business and prestige. However, Panama was still a part
of Colombia at the time, and the country was stalling negotiations
with the U.S. Sensing an opportunity, President Teddy Roosevelt 
went straight to the Panamanians. With encouragement and military support 
from the U.S., Panama launched a coup in 1903. Within days, they became 
an independent nation and signed a treaty to begin 
construction of the canal. Just over a decade after the French left,
the Americans were ready to dig in— and they were determined to avoid
their predecessor’s mistakes. Instead of cutting the mountain
down to sea level, they would raise the sea up the mountain. The plan was to build massive steel gates separating the canal into multiple
chambers with different water levels. As a ship passed through each 
successive gate would open, lowering the water level 
in the next chamber, while raising the ship 
and allowing it to move on. The design called for five 
of these so-called canal locks— three on the Atlantic side
and two on the Pacific, raising traversing ships 26 meters 
above sea level. Operating this lock system would require
a massive reservoir of water. And fortunately, the low-lying Chagres 
river valley provided a natural solution. By building a dam across the gap 
where the river flowed out to sea, the entire valley could be flooded. At 32 meters high 
and over 800 meters wide, the Gatun Dam would be larger 
than any built before. With this innovative plan, the Americans didn’t need to excavate
the entire mountain, but rather, just the pathway
for the canal itself. Still, the work was staggering. Even after progress made by the French,
it took over nine years for 24,000 workers to blow up, shovel, 
and drill out the Culebra Cut— a roughly 14 kilometer passageway 
through the Continental Divide. The railway, now upgraded and rerouted
to follow the canal, carted away over 76 million cubic meters
of excavated rock to be used at the Gatun Dam site. Construction was only half the battle. Leading army officials struggled 
to maintain infrastructure and sanitation, but accidents and diseases took
the lives of 5,000 workers— mostly Black Caribbean migrants. Then, in the fall of 1913,
the moment finally came. A telegraph signal from President Woodrow
Wilson triggered a dike explosion, flooding the Culebra Cut and joining 
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Today, nearly 14,000 vessels travel
through the isthmus annually— each in under 12 hours. The canal remains Panama’s 
chief source of revenue; and since the country gained ownership
of the passage in 1999, it has also become a source
of national pride.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What was the only sea passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans before the canal?
Options: A. Strait of Magellan, B. Strait of Gibraltar, C. Bering Strait
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What was the primary challenge in transporting gold from the west coast to the east coast during the California gold rush?

**Transcript**:
In the middle of the 19th century, the California gold rush brought thousands
of settlers to America’s west coast. But finding gold may have been easier 
than transporting it back east. The only hope for avoiding 
a grueling six month wagon journey was to travel the narrowest portion 
of the continent— the 48-kilometer Isthmus of Panama. By 1855, a railroad spanning the region
significantly shortened to the trip, but unloading and reloading ships
at each port cost time and money. To truly connect these two bodies of water
shipping interests needed a canal— a continuous maritime passage
through the isthmus. The first attempt at this colossal
construction project was taken up in 1881 by French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps. De Lesseps had supervised construction
of Egypt's Suez Canal, but his success made him overconfident. He insisted on digging the canal 
at sea level, even though it required boring 
directly through the Continental Divide mountain range. Futile excavation efforts were buried
under constant landslides. And since the diplomat had only 
visited the site briefly during Panama’s dry season, his workers were unprepared for 
torrential storms, venomous jungle fauna, and tropical diseases. After spending $287 million 
and losing a staggering 22,000 lives, the French abandoned the project. The United States had been considering
building a canal through Nicaragua, but at this point, the chance to succeed
where France failed was tempting. Panamanian leaders were also eager 
to complete a canal which would bring their country
business and prestige. However, Panama was still a part
of Colombia at the time, and the country was stalling negotiations
with the U.S. Sensing an opportunity, President Teddy Roosevelt 
went straight to the Panamanians. With encouragement and military support 
from the U.S., Panama launched a coup in 1903. Within days, they became 
an independent nation and signed a treaty to begin 
construction of the canal. Just over a decade after the French left,
the Americans were ready to dig in— and they were determined to avoid
their predecessor’s mistakes. Instead of cutting the mountain
down to sea level, they would raise the sea up the mountain. The plan was to build massive steel gates separating the canal into multiple
chambers with different water levels. As a ship passed through each 
successive gate would open, lowering the water level 
in the next chamber, while raising the ship 
and allowing it to move on. The design called for five 
of these so-called canal locks— three on the Atlantic side
and two on the Pacific, raising traversing ships 26 meters 
above sea level. Operating this lock system would require
a massive reservoir of water. And fortunately, the low-lying Chagres 
river valley provided a natural solution. By building a dam across the gap 
where the river flowed out to sea, the entire valley could be flooded. At 32 meters high 
and over 800 meters wide, the Gatun Dam would be larger 
than any built before. With this innovative plan, the Americans didn’t need to excavate
the entire mountain, but rather, just the pathway
for the canal itself. Still, the work was staggering. Even after progress made by the French,
it took over nine years for 24,000 workers to blow up, shovel, 
and drill out the Culebra Cut— a roughly 14 kilometer passageway 
through the Continental Divide. The railway, now upgraded and rerouted
to follow the canal, carted away over 76 million cubic meters
of excavated rock to be used at the Gatun Dam site. Construction was only half the battle. Leading army officials struggled 
to maintain infrastructure and sanitation, but accidents and diseases took
the lives of 5,000 workers— mostly Black Caribbean migrants. Then, in the fall of 1913,
the moment finally came. A telegraph signal from President Woodrow
Wilson triggered a dike explosion, flooding the Culebra Cut and joining

**Transcript**:
By the end of the 20th century, the race to build the world's tallest
skyscraper grinded to a halt. Each new contender was only slightly
taller than the one before, and architects were running out of ways
to top their previous efforts. But in 2004 construction began
on a new building in Dubai, promising a revolutionary design 
that would dwarf the competition. In 2009, the 828-meter Burj Khalifa 
was complete, surpassing the previous 
record-holder by over 60%. So what innovations allowed 
for such a huge leap in height? For most of architectural history,
heavy building materials made it difficult for tall buildings 
to support their own weight. To compensate, taller structures had 
wider, thicker masonry at the base, making them substantially more expensive. The arrival of industrial steel 
in the early 20th century helped buildings shed weight, 
and stretch to new heights. But steel frames required intensive
labor to produce, often under poor working conditions. And when they were finished, these three dimensional grids took up huge
amounts of space inside buildings. Tall steel skyscrapers also had 
larger, less dense surfaces, making them vulnerable to strong winds. Architects designed various 
countermeasures to prevent swaying and structural damage, but to increase height further, engineers would have to completely rethink
how tall buildings were designed. Enter the father of modern skyscrapers:
Fazlur Rahman Khan. This Bangladeshi-American engineer
believed tall structures should bear their weight where they were 
widest and most stable— on the outside. He proposed swapping an internal grid 
of steel beams for a steel and concrete exoskeleton that would make buildings
more resilient to wind while using far less heavy materials. Khan developed this idea into what
he called tubular designs. These buildings had exterior steel frames
that were braced with concrete and connected to horizontal floor beams. Tubular frames proved superior
at absorbing and transferring the force of wind to a building's
foundation. And since the exterior walls could
bear the bulk of the load, internal supporting columns could
be removed to maximize space. Following the 1960s, tubular design
became the industry standard. This new philosophy allowed 
for the construction of taller, sturdier skyscrapers, including many of the record holders 
for world’s tallest building. But planning the Burj Khalifa would
take one more innovation. In 2004, the late Fazlur Khan’s 
longtime employers, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, completed 
the Tower Palace III in South Korea. This building took Khan's exoskeleton
design one step further, with a central column supported
by three protruding wings. Each wing’s weight carries the other two, while the heavy concrete core acts 
as a support beam, that also houses the building’s elevators 
and mechanical infrastructure. This design, called the buttressed core, allowed the entire structure to work 
as a single load-bearing unit, supporting the building’s 73 stories. SOM was confident the buttressed core
could support a much taller building, and they were determined to see how high
they could go with their next project. As only the second building
to use this design, the Burj Khalifa spans 
an unprecedented 163 floors. To battle the monumental 
vertical and lateral forces, the design strategically places 
the strongest, load-bearing areas where the wind is also most powerful. Additionally, the Y-shaped layout 
was specifically calibrated to minimize local wind forces. Every several floors, 
one of the wings recedes slightly, forming a series of setbacks
in a clockwise pattern. This spiral shape disperses air currents, transforming 240 kilometer per hour
winds into harmless gusts. Considering its height and unique design, the Burj Khalifa was completed 
in a staggeringly short five year period. However, this pace came
at a great human cost. The workforce consisted mostly 
of South Asian migrants, who regularly endured shifts 
over 12 hours long for a daily wage of roughly $10. Those who tried to quit or return home 
had their paychecks and passports withheld by the project’s construction company. These abusive conditions led
to multiple protests, in addition to at least one suicide, 
and one fatal accident reported on site. In the years following 
the tower’s completion, the United Arab Emirates fell
under harsh scrutiny for failing to enforce worker
protection laws. Hopefully, future projects
will prioritize the individuals behind these engineering marvels 
over the buildings themselves.

**Transcript**:
By the end of the 20th century, the race to build the world's tallest
skyscraper grinded to a halt. Each new contender was only slightly
taller than the one before, and architects were running out of ways
to top their previous efforts. But in 2004 construction began
on a new building in Dubai, promising a revolutionary design 
that would dwarf the competition. In 2009, the 828-meter Burj Khalifa 
was complete, surpassing the previous 
record-holder by over 60%. So what innovations allowed 
for such a huge leap in height? For most of architectural history,
heavy building materials made it difficult for tall buildings 
to support their own weight. To compensate, taller structures had 
wider, thicker masonry at the base, making them substantially more expensive. The arrival of industrial steel 
in the early 20th century helped buildings shed weight, 
and stretch to new heights. But steel frames required intensive
labor to produce, often under poor working conditions. And when they were finished, these three dimensional grids took up huge
amounts of space inside buildings. Tall steel skyscrapers also had 
larger, less dense surfaces, making them vulnerable to strong winds. Architects designed various 
countermeasures to prevent swaying and structural damage, but to increase height further, engineers would have to completely rethink
how tall buildings were designed. Enter the father of modern skyscrapers:
Fazlur Rahman Khan. This Bangladeshi-American engineer
believed tall structures should bear their weight where they were 
widest and most stable— on the outside. He proposed swapping an internal grid 
of steel beams for a steel and concrete exoskeleton that would make buildings
more resilient to wind while using far less heavy materials. Khan developed this idea into what
he called tubular designs. These buildings had exterior steel frames
that were braced with concrete and connected to horizontal floor beams. Tubular frames proved superior
at absorbing and transferring the force of wind to a building's
foundation. And since the exterior walls could
bear the bulk of the load, internal supporting columns could
be removed to maximize space. Following the 1960s, tubular design
became the industry standard. This new philosophy allowed 
for the construction of taller, sturdier skyscrapers, including many of the record holders 
for world’s tallest building. But planning the Burj Khalifa would
take one more innovation. In 2004, the late Fazlur Khan’s 
longtime employers, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, completed 
the Tower Palace III in South Korea. This building took Khan's exoskeleton
design one step further, with a central column supported
by three protruding wings. Each wing’s weight carries the other two, while the heavy concrete core acts 
as a support beam, that also houses the building’s elevators 
and mechanical infrastructure. This design, called the buttressed core, allowed the entire structure to work 
as a single load-bearing unit, supporting the building’s 73 stories. SOM was confident the buttressed core
could support a much taller building, and they were determined to see how high
they could go with their next project. As only the second building
to use this design, the Burj Khalifa spans 
an unprecedented 163 floors. To battle the monumental 
vertical and lateral forces, the design strategically places 
the strongest, load-bearing areas where the wind is also most powerful. Additionally, the Y-shaped layout 
was specifically calibrated to minimize local wind forces. Every several floors, 
one of the wings recedes slightly, forming a series of setbacks
in a clockwise pattern. This spiral shape disperses air currents, transforming 240 kilometer per hour
winds into harmless gusts. Considering its height and unique design, the Burj Khalifa was completed 
in a staggeringly short five year period. However, this pace came
at a great human cost. The workforce consisted mostly 
of South Asian migrants, who regularly endured shifts 
over 12 hours long for a daily wage of roughly $10. Those who tried to quit or return home 
had their paychecks and passports withheld by the project’s construction company. These abusive conditions led
to multiple protests, in addition to at least one suicide, 
and one fatal accident reported on site. In the years following 
the tower’s completion, the United Arab Emirates fell
under harsh scrutiny for failing to enforce worker
protection laws. Hopefully, future projects
will prioritize the individuals behind these engineering marvels 
over the buildings themselves.

**Transcript**:
Socrates, one of the founding fathers
of Western philosophical thought, was on trial. Many Athenians believed 
he was a dangerous enemy of the state, accusing the philosopher
of corrupting the youth and refusing to recognize their gods. However, Socrates wasn’t feared 
for claiming to have all the answers, but rather, for asking too many questions. While he loathed formal lectures, the philosopher frequently
engaged friends and strangers in lengthy conversations
about morality and society. These discussions weren’t debates,
nor would Socrates offer explicit advice. In fact, the philosopher often claimed
to know nothing at all, responding to his partner's answers
only with further questions. But through this process, 
Socrates probed their logic, revealing its flaws and helping both
parties reach a more robust understanding. These insightful questions made Socrates
beloved by his followers. Two of his students, Plato and Xenophon,
were so inspired that they replicated their mentor’s 
process in fictional dialogues. These invented exchanges
provide perfect examples of what would come to be known 
as the Socratic Method. In one of these fabricated dialogues, Socrates is conversing with 
a young man named Euthydemus, who is confident that he understands 
the nature of justice and injustice. Socrates probes the student’s values
by asking him to label actions such as lying and theft 
as just or unjust. Euthydemus confidently categorizes
them as injustices, but this only prompts another question: is it just for a general to deceive
or pillage a hostile army? Euthydemus revises his assertion. He claims that these actions 
are just when done to enemies, and unjust when done to friends. But Socrates isn’t finished. He asks the young man to consider 
a commander lying to his troops to boost their morale. Before long, Euthydemus is despondent. It seems that every answer
leads to further problems, and perhaps he’s not quite sure
what constitutes justice after all. In employing this
question-oriented approach, Socrates described himself as a midwife, whose inquiries assist others
in giving birth to their ideas. His method of questioning draws out an
individual’s unexamined assumptions, and then challenges those biases. It doesn't always provide
definitive answers, but the method helps clarify the questions and eliminate contradictory 
or circular logic. And by following a line of inquiry 
where it logically leads, both the question asker and answerer
can end up in unexpected places. This technique isn’t limited 
by the conversation’s content, making it incredibly useful
in numerous fields. During the Renaissance, the method was
used to teach clinical medicine. Students proposed their rationale
for different diagnoses, while a doctor questioned their
assumptions and moderated discussion. In this model, the method could even
produce conclusive results. This same approach was later used
in other sciences, such as astronomy, botany, 
and mathematics. Following the Protestant Reformation, it was adapted to tackle abstract
questions of faith. In the 19th century, the method 
became an essential part of American legal education. Professors explored students’ 
understanding of judicial reasoning by challenging them with unforeseen
hypothetical situations. This approach is still used today
by the Supreme Court to imagine the unintended impacts 
of passing a law. The Socratic Method can be adapted 
to teach almost any topic that relies on critical reasoning, but its success depends on the teacher 
employing it. An effective Socratic educator 
must be well versed in their subject. Rather than bullying their students
or showing off their superior intellect, they should be modest, genuinely curious, 
and affirming of every contribution. In this regard, Socrates himself may not have been 
the most subtle Socratic teacher. Historians believe he was deeply critical
of Athens’ particular brand of democracy, and known to pass those concerns
onto his followers. These subversive beliefs were
distorted in public forums and thought to have inspired 
two of his pupils to treasonous ends. It was likely for these ideas
Socrates was brought to trial, and eventually, 
sentenced to death. But even on his deathbed, artists depict
a serene philosopher— ever curious to explore 
the ultimate question.

about morality and society. These discussions weren’t debates,
nor would Socrates offer explicit advice. In fact, the philosopher often claimed
to know nothing at all, responding to his partner's answers
only with further questions. But through this process, 
Socrates probed their logic, revealing its flaws and helping both
parties reach a more robust understanding. These insightful questions made Socrates
beloved by his followers. Two of his students, Plato and Xenophon,
were so inspired that they replicated their mentor’s 
process in fictional dialogues. These invented exchanges
provide perfect examples of what would come to be known 
as the Socratic Method. In one of these fabricated dialogues, Socrates is conversing with 
a young man named Euthydemus, who is confident that he understands 
the nature of justice and injustice. Socrates probes the student’s values
by asking him to label actions such as lying and theft 
as just or unjust. Euthydemus confidently categorizes
them as injustices, but this only prompts another question: is it just for a general to deceive
or pillage a hostile army? Euthydemus revises his assertion. He claims that these actions 
are just when done to enemies, and unjust when done to friends. But Socrates isn’t finished. He asks the young man to consider 
a commander lying to his troops to boost their morale. Before long, Euthydemus is despondent. It seems that every answer
leads to further problems, and perhaps he’s not quite sure
what constitutes justice after all. In employing this
question-oriented approach, Socrates described himself as a midwife, whose inquiries assist others
in giving birth to their ideas. His method of questioning draws out an
individual’s unexamined assumptions, and then challenges those biases. It doesn't always provide
definitive answers, but the method helps clarify the questions and eliminate contradictory 
or circular logic. And by following a line of inquiry 
where it logically leads, both the question asker and answerer
can end up in unexpected places. This technique isn’t limited 
by the conversation’s content, making it incredibly useful
in numerous fields. During the Renaissance, the method was
used to teach clinical medicine. Students proposed their rationale
for different diagnoses, while a doctor questioned their
assumptions and moderated discussion. In this model, the method could even
produce conclusive results. This same approach was later used
in other sciences, such as astronomy, botany, 
and mathematics. Following the Protestant Reformation, it was adapted to tackle abstract
questions of faith. In the 19th century, the method 
became an essential part of American legal education. Professors explored students’ 
understanding of judicial reasoning by challenging them with unforeseen
hypothetical situations. This approach is still used today
by the Supreme Court to imagine the unintended impacts 
of passing a law. The Socratic Method can be adapted 
to teach almost any topic that relies on critical reasoning, but its success depends on the teacher 
employing it. An effective Socratic educator 
must be well versed in their subject. Rather than bullying their students
or showing off their superior intellect, they should be modest, genuinely curious, 
and affirming of every contribution. In this regard, Socrates himself may not have been 
the most subtle Socratic teacher. Historians believe he was deeply critical
of Athens’ particular brand of democracy, and known to pass those concerns
onto his followers. These subversive beliefs were
distorted in public forums and thought to have inspired 
two of his pupils to treasonous ends. It was likely for these ideas
Socrates was brought to trial, and eventually, 
sentenced to death. But even on his deathbed, artists depict
a serene philosopher— ever curious to explore 
the ultimate question.

**Transcript**:
It’s 1481. In the city of Seville, devout Catholics are turning themselves 
in to the authorities. They’re confessing to heresy— failure to
follow the beliefs of the Catholic Church. But why? The Spanish Inquisition
has arrived in Seville. The Inquisition began in 1478, 
when Pope Sixtus IV issued a decree authorizing the Catholic monarchs, 
Ferdinand and Isabella, to root out heresy
in the Spanish kingdoms— a confederacy of semi-independent kingdoms in the area that would become
the modern country of Spain. Though the order came from the church,
the monarchs had requested it. When the Inquisition began, 
the Spanish kingdoms were diverse both ethnically and religiously, with Jews, Muslims, and Christians living
in the same regions. The Inquisition quickly turned
its attention to ridding the region of people who were not
part of the Catholic Church. It would last more than 350 years. On the ground, groups called tribunals ran
the Inquisition in each region. Roles on a tribunal could include an arresting constable, 
a prosecuting attorney, inquisitors to question the accused,
and a scribe. A “Grand Inquisitor,” a member of the 
clergy selected by the king and queen, almost always led a tribunal. The Inquisition marked its arrival in each
new place with an “Edict of Grace.” Typically lasting 40 days, the Edict of Grace promised mercy
to those who confess to heresy. After that, the inquisitors persecuted
suspected heretics on the basis of anonymous accusations. So the confessors in Seville probably
didn’t see themselves as actual heretics— instead, they were hedging their bets
by reporting themselves when the consequences were low, rather than risking 
imprisonment or torture if someone else accused them later on. They were right to worry: once the authorities arrested someone, 
accusations were often vague, so the accused didn’t know the reasons 
for their arrest or the identity of their accuser. Victims were imprisoned 
for months or even years. Once arrested, 
their property was confiscated, often leaving their families
on the street. Under these conditions, victims confessed
to the most mundane forms of heresy— like hanging linen to dry on a Saturday. The Inquisition targeted different subsets
of the population over time. In 1492, at the brutal Grand Inquisitor
Tomás de Torquemada’s urging, the monarchs issued a decree giving 
Spanish Jews four months to either convert to Christianity
or leave the kingdom. Thousands were expelled 
and those who stayed risked persecution. Converts to Christianity,
known as conversos, weren’t even safe, because authorities suspected 
them of practicing Judaism in secret. The hatred directed at conversos
was both religious and economic, as conversos made up a large portion
of the upper middle class. The Inquisition eventually
shifted its focus to the moriscos, converts to Christianity from Islam. In 1609, an edict passed forcing
all moriscos to leave. An estimated 300,000 left. Those who remained became 
the Inquisition’s next targets. The inquisitors announced the punishments
of those found guilty of heresy in public gatherings called autos de fé,
or acts of faith. Hundreds of people gathered to watch 
the procession of sinners, mass, sermon, and finally the announcement
of punishments. Most of the accused received punishments
like imprisonment, exile, or having to wear a sanbenito, 
a garment that marked them as a sinner. The worst punishment 
was “relaxado en persona”— a euphemism for burning at the stake. This punishment was relatively uncommon— reserved for unrepentant
and relapsed heretics. Over 350 years after Queen Isabella
started the Inquisition, her namesake, Queen Isabella II, 
formally ended it on July 15th, 1834. The Spanish kingdoms’ dependence 
on the Catholic Church had isolated them while the rest of Europe
experienced the Enlightenment and embraced the separation 
of church and state. Historians still debate the number 
of people killed during the Inquisition. Some suggest over 30,000 
but most estimate between 1,000 and 2,000. The consequences of the Inquisition,
however, reach far beyond fatalities. In some places, an estimated 1/3
of prisoners were tortured. Hundreds of thousands of members 
of religious minorities were forced to leave their homes, and those who remained faced 
discrimination and economic hardship. Smaller inquisitions in Spanish

**Transcript**:
It’s 1481. In the city of Seville, devout Catholics are turning themselves 
in to the authorities. They’re confessing to heresy— failure to
follow the beliefs of the Catholic Church. But why? The Spanish Inquisition
has arrived in Seville. The Inquisition began in 1478, 
when Pope Sixtus IV issued a decree authorizing the Catholic monarchs, 
Ferdinand and Isabella, to root out heresy
in the Spanish kingdoms— a confederacy of semi-independent kingdoms in the area that would become
the modern country of Spain. Though the order came from the church,
the monarchs had requested it. When the Inquisition began, 
the Spanish kingdoms were diverse both ethnically and religiously, with Jews, Muslims, and Christians living
in the same regions. The Inquisition quickly turned
its attention to ridding the region of people who were not
part of the Catholic Church. It would last more than 350 years. On the ground, groups called tribunals ran
the Inquisition in each region. Roles on a tribunal could include an arresting constable, 
a prosecuting attorney, inquisitors to question the accused,
and a scribe. A “Grand Inquisitor,” a member of the 
clergy selected by the king and queen, almost always led a tribunal. The Inquisition marked its arrival in each
new place with an “Edict of Grace.” Typically lasting 40 days, the Edict of Grace promised mercy
to those who confess to heresy. After that, the inquisitors persecuted
suspected heretics on the basis of anonymous accusations. So the confessors in Seville probably
didn’t see themselves as actual heretics— instead, they were hedging their bets
by reporting themselves when the consequences were low, rather than risking 
imprisonment or torture if someone else accused them later on. They were right to worry: once the authorities arrested someone, 
accusations were often vague, so the accused didn’t know the reasons 
for their arrest or the identity of their accuser. Victims were imprisoned 
for months or even years. Once arrested, 
their property was confiscated, often leaving their families
on the street. Under these conditions, victims confessed
to the most mundane forms of heresy— like hanging linen to dry on a Saturday. The Inquisition targeted different subsets
of the population over time. In 1492, at the brutal Grand Inquisitor
Tomás de Torquemada’s urging, the monarchs issued a decree giving 
Spanish Jews four months to either convert to Christianity
or leave the kingdom. Thousands were expelled 
and those who stayed risked persecution. Converts to Christianity,
known as conversos, weren’t even safe, because authorities suspected 
them of practicing Judaism in secret. The hatred directed at conversos
was both religious and economic, as conversos made up a large portion
of the upper middle class. The Inquisition eventually
shifted its focus to the moriscos, converts to Christianity from Islam. In 1609, an edict passed forcing
all moriscos to leave. An estimated 300,000 left. Those who remained became 
the Inquisition’s next targets. The inquisitors announced the punishments
of those found guilty of heresy in public gatherings called autos de fé,
or acts of faith. Hundreds of people gathered to watch 
the procession of sinners, mass, sermon, and finally the announcement
of punishments. Most of the accused received punishments
like imprisonment, exile, or having to wear a sanbenito, 
a garment that marked them as a sinner. The worst punishment 
was “relaxado en persona”— a euphemism for burning at the stake. This punishment was relatively uncommon— reserved for unrepentant
and relapsed heretics. Over 350 years after Queen Isabella
started the Inquisition, her namesake, Queen Isabella II, 
formally ended it on July 15th, 1834. The Spanish kingdoms’ dependence 
on the Catholic Church had isolated them while the rest of Europe
experienced the Enlightenment and embraced the separation 
of church and state. Historians still debate the number 
of people killed during the Inquisition. Some suggest over 30,000 
but most estimate between 1,000 and 2,000. The consequences of the Inquisition,
however, reach far beyond fatalities. In some places, an estimated 1/3
of prisoners were tortured. Hundreds of thousands of members 
of religious minorities were forced to leave their homes, and those who remained faced 
discrimination and economic hardship. Smaller inquisitions in Spanish 
colonial territories in the Americas, especially Mexico,
carried their own tolls. Friends turned in friends, 
neighbors accused neighbors, and even family members reported
each other of heresy. Under the Inquisition, people were condemned to live 
in fear and paranoia for centuries.

**Transcript**:
Today, artificial intelligence helps
doctors diagnose patients, pilots fly commercial aircraft, 
and city planners predict traffic. But no matter what these AIs are doing,
the computer scientists who designed them likely don’t know exactly 
how they’re doing it. This is because artificial intelligence 
is often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique array 
of rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? There are many different ways 
to build self-teaching programs. But they all rely on the three 
basic types of machine learning: unsupervised learning, supervised 
learning, and reinforcement learning. To see these in action, let’s imagine researchers are trying
to pull information from a set of medical data containing
thousands of patient profiles. First up, unsupervised learning. This approach would be ideal
for analyzing all the profiles to find general similarities
and useful patterns. Maybe certain patients have similar
disease presentations, or perhaps a treatment produces
specific sets of side effects. This broad pattern-seeking approach 
can be used to identify similarities between patient profiles 
and find emerging patterns, all without human guidance. But let's imagine doctors are looking
for something more specific. These physicians want 
to create an algorithm for diagnosing a particular condition. They begin by collecting two sets of data— medical images and test results
from both healthy patients and those diagnosed with the condition. Then, they input this data into a program designed to identify features
shared by the sick patients but not the healthy patients. Based on how frequently 
it sees certain features, the program will assign values to those
features’ diagnostic significance, generating an algorithm 
for diagnosing future patients. However, unlike unsupervised learning, doctors and computer scientists have 
an active role in what happens next. Doctors will make the final diagnosis and check the accuracy 
of the algorithm’s prediction. Then computer scientists can use
the updated datasets to adjust the program’s parameters 
and improve its accuracy. This hands-on approach is called
supervised learning. Now, let’s say these doctors want 
to design another algorithm to recommend treatment plans. Since these plans
will be implemented in stages, and they may change depending on each
individual's response to treatments, the doctors decide to use
reinforcement learning. This program uses an iterative approach
to gather feedback about which medications, dosages 
and treatments are most effective. Then, it compares that data 
against each patient’s profile to create their unique, optimal 
treatment plan. As the treatments progress and the program
receives more feedback, it can constantly update 
the plan for each patient. None of these three techniques are
inherently smarter than any other. While some require more or less 
human intervention, they all have their own strengths
and weaknesses which makes them best suited
for certain tasks. However, by using them together, researchers can build complex AI systems, where individual programs can 
supervise and teach each other. For example, 
when our unsupervised learning program finds groups of patients that are similar, it could send that data to a connected 
supervised learning program. That program could then incorporate 
this information into its predictions. Or perhaps dozens of reinforcement
learning programs might simulate potential patient outcomes to collect feedback 
about different treatment plans. There are numerous ways to create
these machine-learning systems, and perhaps the most promising models are those that mimic the relationship 
between neurons in the brain. These artificial neural networks can use
millions of connections to tackle difficult tasks like 
image recognition, speech recognition, and even language translation. However, the more self-directed
these models become, the harder it is for computer scientists to determine how these self-taught 
algorithms arrive at their solution. Researchers are already looking at ways 
to make machine learning more transparent. But as AI becomes more involved
in our everyday lives, these enigmatic decisions have
increasingly large impacts on our work, health, and safety. So as machines continue learning 
to investigate, negotiate and communicate, we must also consider how to teach them 
to teach each other to operate ethically.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How does supervised machine learning figure out what rules to follow to do a task?
Options: A. The data scientist has to learn the rules and program them for the computer to follow, B. The rules are learned by the computer on its own, C. The rules are found by mathematical proof
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the primary role of doctors in supervised learning?
Options: A. To create an algorithm for diagnosing a particular condition, B. To collect medical images and test results, C. To make the final diagnosis and check the accuracy of the algorithm's prediction, D. To adjust the program's parameters and improve its accuracy

**Transcript**:
Today, artificial intelligence helps
doctors diagnose patients, pilots fly commercial aircraft, 
and city planners predict traffic. But no matter what these AIs are doing,
the computer scientists who designed them likely don’t know exactly 
how they’re doing it. This is because artificial intelligence 
is often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique array 
of rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? There are many different ways 
to build self-teaching programs. But they all rely on the three 
basic types of machine learning: unsupervised learning, supervised 
learning, and reinforcement learning. To see these in action, let’s imagine researchers are trying
to pull information from a set of medical data containing
thousands of patient profiles. First up, unsupervised learning. This approach would be ideal
for analyzing all the profiles to find general similarities
and useful patterns. Maybe certain patients have similar
disease presentations, or perhaps a treatment produces
specific sets of side effects. This broad pattern-seeking approach 
can be used to identify similarities between patient profiles 
and find emerging patterns, all without human guidance. But let's imagine doctors are looking
for something more specific. These physicians want 
to create an algorithm for diagnosing a particular condition. They begin by collecting two sets of data— medical images and test results
from both healthy patients and those diagnosed with the condition. Then, they input this data into a program designed to identify features
shared by the sick patients but not the healthy patients. Based on how frequently 
it sees certain features, the program will assign values to those
features’ diagnostic significance, generating an algorithm 
for diagnosing future patients. However, unlike unsupervised learning, doctors and computer scientists have 
an active role in what happens next. Doctors will make the final diagnosis and check the accuracy 
of the algorithm’s prediction. Then computer scientists can use
the updated datasets to adjust the program’s parameters 
and improve its accuracy. This hands-on approach is called
supervised learning. Now, let’s say these doctors want 
to design another algorithm to recommend treatment plans. Since these plans
will be implemented in stages, and they may change depending on each
individual's response to treatments, the doctors decide to use
reinforcement learning. This program uses an iterative approach
to gather feedback about which medications, dosages 
and treatments are most effective. Then, it compares that data 
against each patient’s profile to create their unique, optimal 
treatment plan. As the treatments progress and the program
receives more feedback, it can constantly update 
the plan for each patient. None of these three techniques are
inherently smarter than any other. While some require more or less 
human intervention, they all have their own strengths
and weaknesses which makes them best suited
for certain tasks. However, by using them together, researchers can build complex AI systems, where individual programs can 
supervise and teach each other. For example, 
when our unsupervised learning program finds groups of patients that are similar, it could send that data to a connected 
supervised learning program. That program could then incorporate 
this information into its predictions. Or perhaps dozens of reinforcement
learning programs might simulate potential patient outcomes to collect feedback 
about different treatment plans. There are numerous ways to create
these machine-learning systems, and perhaps the most promising models are those that mimic the relationship 
between neurons in the brain. These artificial neural networks can use
millions of connections to tackle difficult tasks like 
image recognition, speech recognition, and even language translation. However, the more self-directed
these models become, the harder it is for computer scientists to determine how these self-taught 
algorithms arrive at their solution. Researchers are already looking at ways 
to make machine learning more transparent. But as AI becomes more involved
in our everyday lives, these enigmatic decisions have
increasingly large impacts on our work, health, and safety. So as machines continue learning 
to investigate, negotiate and communicate, we must also consider how to teach them 
to teach each other to operate ethically.

over the ringing in her ears. By the next morning, 
the effect has mostly worn off, but Anja still has questions. What caused the symptoms? 
Is her hearing going to fully recover? And can she still go to concerts
without damaging her ears? To answer these questions, we first need to understand what sound is
and how we hear it. Like a pebble creating ripples in water, sound is created when displaced molecules
vibrate through space. While sound vibrations can travel
through solids and liquids, our ears have evolved to process
vibrations in the air. These waves of air pressure enter 
our ear canals and bounce off the eardrum. A trio of bones called the ossicular chain then carries those vibrations 
into the cochlea, transforming waves of air pressure
into waves of cochlear fluid. Here, our perception of sound
begins to take form. The waves of fluid move
the basilar membrane, a tissue lined with tens of thousands
of hair cells. The specific vibration of these hair cells
and the stereocilia on top of each one determine the auditory signal 
our brain perceives. Unfortunately, these essential cells
are also quite vulnerable. There are two properties of sound 
that can damage these cells. The first is volume. The louder a sound is, the greater
the pressure of its vibrations. While the ear’s upper limits vary
from person to person, close range exposure to sound
exceeding 120 decibels can instantly bend or blow out hair cells,
resulting in permanent hearing damage. The pressure of more powerful sounds 
can even dislocate the ossicular chain or burst an eardrum. The other side of this equation 
is the sound’s duration. While dangerously loud sounds 
can injure ears almost instantly, hair cells can also be damaged by exposure to lower sound pressure 
for long periods. For example, hearing a hand dryer is safe 
for the 20 seconds you’re using it. But if you listened 
for 8 consecutive hours, this relatively low-pressure sound 
would overwork the stereocilia and swell the hair cell’s 
supporting tissue. Swollen hair cells are unable to vibrate 
with the appropriate speed and accuracy, making hearing muffled. This kind of hearing loss is known
as a temporary threshold shift, and many people will experience 
it at least once in their lifetime. In Anja’s case, 
the loud sounds of the concert only took three hours
to cause this condition. Fortunately, it's a temporary ailment
that usually resolves as swelling decreases over time. In most cases, simply avoiding hazardous sounds 
gives hair cells all they need to recover. One temporary threshold shift isn’t likely
to cause permanent hearing loss. But frequent exposure 
to dangerous sound levels can lead to a wide range 
of hearing disorders, such as the constant buzz of tinnitus or difficulty understanding speech
in loud environments. Overworked hair cells can also generate
dangerous molecules called reactive oxygen species. These molecules
have unpaired electrons, driving them to steal electrons
from nearby cells and cause permanent damage
to the inner ear. There are numerous strategies you can
adopt for preventing hearing loss. Current research around earbud headphone
use suggests keeping your volume at 80% or less if you’ll be listening for 
more than 90 minutes throughout the day. Noise-isolating headphones can also help 
you listen at lower volumes. Getting a baseline understanding 
of your hearing is essential to protecting 
your auditory system. Just like our eyes and teeth,
our ears also need annual check-ups. Not all communities have
access to audiologists, but organizations around the world are
developing portable hearing tests and easy-to-use apps to bring these
vital resources to remote regions. Finally, wear earplugs
when you’re knowingly exposing yourself to loud sounds for extended periods. An earplug’s effectiveness depends 
on how well you’ve inserted it, so be careful to read the instructions. But when worn correctly, they can ensure you'll be able
to hear your favorite band for many nights to come.

use suggests keeping your volume at 80% or less if you’ll be listening for 
more than 90 minutes throughout the day. Noise-isolating headphones can also help 
you listen at lower volumes. Getting a baseline understanding 
of your hearing is essential to protecting 
your auditory system. Just like our eyes and teeth,
our ears also need annual check-ups. Not all communities have
access to audiologists, but organizations around the world are
developing portable hearing tests and easy-to-use apps to bring these
vital resources to remote regions. Finally, wear earplugs
when you’re knowingly exposing yourself to loud sounds for extended periods. An earplug’s effectiveness depends 
on how well you’ve inserted it, so be careful to read the instructions. But when worn correctly, they can ensure you'll be able
to hear your favorite band for many nights to come.

**Transcript**:
For as long as we’ve had language,
some people have tried to control it. And some of the most frequent targets 
of this communication regulation are the ums, ers, and likes 
that pepper our conversations. Ancient Greek and Latin texts warned
against speaking with hesitation, modern schools have tried 
to ban the offending terms, and renowned linguist Noam Chomsky
dismissed these expressions as “errors” irrelevant to language. Historically, these speech components
had been lumped into the broader bucket of “disfluencies”— linguistic fillers which distract 
from useful speech. However, none of this controversy has made
these so-called disfluencies less common. They continue to occur roughly 
2 to 3 times per minute in natural speech. And different versions of them can
be found in almost every language, including sign language. So are ums and uhs 
just a habit we can’t break? Or is there more to them
than meets the ear? To answer this question, it helps 
to compare these speech components to other words we use in everyday life. While a written word might have
multiple definitions, we can usually determine its intended
meaning through context. In speech however, a word can take
on additional layers of meaning. Tone of voice, 
the relationship between speakers, and expectations of where 
a conversation will go can imbue even words that seem like filler
with vital information. This is where “um” and “uh” come in. Or “eh” and “ehm,” “tutoa” and “öö,”
“eto” and “ano.” Linguists call these filled pauses, which
are a kind of hesitation phenomenon. And these seemingly 
insignificant interruptions are actually quite meaningful 
in spoken communication. For example, while a silent pause
might be interpreted as a sign for others to start speaking, a filled pause can signal
that you’re not finished yet. Hesitation phenomena can buy time for your
speech to catch up with your thoughts, or to fish out the right word 
for a situation. And they don’t just benefit the speaker— a filled pause lets your listeners know
an important word is on the way. Linguists have even found 
that people are more likely to remember a word 
if it comes after a hesitation. Hesitation phenomena 
aren’t the only parts of speech that take on new meaning during dialogue. Words and phrases such as “like,” 
“well” or “you know” function as discourse markers, ignoring their literal meaning to convey 
something about the sentence in which they appear. Discourse markers direct 
the flow of conversation, and some studies suggest 
that conscientious speakers use more of these phrases to ensure 
everyone is being heard and understood. For example, starting a sentence 
with “Look...” can indicate your attitude and help 
you gauge the listener’s agreement. “I mean” can signal that you’re about
to elaborate on something. And the dreaded “like” 
can perform many functions, such as establishing a loose
connection between thoughts, or introducing someone else's
words or actions. These markers give people a real-time
view into your thought process and help listeners follow, interpret, 
and predict what you’re trying to say. Discourse markers and hesitation phenomena aren’t just useful 
for understanding language— they help us learn it too. In 2011, a study showed toddlers 
common and uncommon objects alongside a recording referring 
to one of the items. When a later recording asked them 
to identify the uncommon object, toddlers performed better if that 
instruction contained a filled pause. This may mean that filled pauses 
cue toddlers to expect novel words, and help them connect new words
to new objects. For adolescents and adults 
learning a second language, filled pauses smooth out awkward 
early conversations. And once they’re more confident, the second-language learner can signal
their newfound fluency by using the appropriate 
hesitation phenomenon. Because, contrary to popular belief, the use of filled pauses doesn't decrease
with mastery of a language. Just because hesitation phenomena
and discourse markers are a natural part of communication 
doesn’t mean they’re always appropriate. Outside of writing dialogue, they serve 
no purpose in most formal writing. And in some contexts, the stigma
these social cues carry can work against the speaker. But in most conversations, 
these seemingly senseless sounds can convey a world of meaning.

**Transcript**:
For as long as we’ve had language,
some people have tried to control it. And some of the most frequent targets 
of this communication regulation are the ums, ers, and likes 
that pepper our conversations. Ancient Greek and Latin texts warned
against speaking with hesitation, modern schools have tried 
to ban the offending terms, and renowned linguist Noam Chomsky
dismissed these expressions as “errors” irrelevant to language. Historically, these speech components
had been lumped into the broader bucket of “disfluencies”— linguistic fillers which distract 
from useful speech. However, none of this controversy has made
these so-called disfluencies less common. They continue to occur roughly 
2 to 3 times per minute in natural speech. And different versions of them can
be found in almost every language, including sign language. So are ums and uhs 
just a habit we can’t break? Or is there more to them
than meets the ear? To answer this question, it helps 
to compare these speech components to other words we use in everyday life. While a written word might have
multiple definitions, we can usually determine its intended
meaning through context. In speech however, a word can take
on additional layers of meaning. Tone of voice, 
the relationship between speakers, and expectations of where 
a conversation will go can imbue even words that seem like filler
with vital information. This is where “um” and “uh” come in. Or “eh” and “ehm,” “tutoa” and “öö,”
“eto” and “ano.” Linguists call these filled pauses, which
are a kind of hesitation phenomenon. And these seemingly 
insignificant interruptions are actually quite meaningful 
in spoken communication. For example, while a silent pause
might be interpreted as a sign for others to start speaking, a filled pause can signal
that you’re not finished yet. Hesitation phenomena can buy time for your
speech to catch up with your thoughts, or to fish out the right word 
for a situation. And they don’t just benefit the speaker— a filled pause lets your listeners know
an important word is on the way. Linguists have even found 
that people are more likely to remember a word 
if it comes after a hesitation. Hesitation phenomena 
aren’t the only parts of speech that take on new meaning during dialogue. Words and phrases such as “like,” 
“well” or “you know” function as discourse markers, ignoring their literal meaning to convey 
something about the sentence in which they appear. Discourse markers direct 
the flow of conversation, and some studies suggest 
that conscientious speakers use more of these phrases to ensure 
everyone is being heard and understood. For example, starting a sentence 
with “Look...” can indicate your attitude and help 
you gauge the listener’s agreement. “I mean” can signal that you’re about
to elaborate on something. And the dreaded “like” 
can perform many functions, such as establishing a loose
connection between thoughts, or introducing someone else's
words or actions. These markers give people a real-time
view into your thought process and help listeners follow, interpret, 
and predict what you’re trying to say. Discourse markers and hesitation phenomena aren’t just useful 
for understanding language— they help us learn it too. In 2011, a study showed toddlers 
common and uncommon objects alongside a recording referring 
to one of the items. When a later recording asked them 
to identify the uncommon object, toddlers performed better if that 
instruction contained a filled pause. This may mean that filled pauses 
cue toddlers to expect novel words, and help them connect new words
to new objects. For adolescents and adults 
learning a second language, filled pauses smooth out awkward 
early conversations. And once they’re more confident, the second-language learner can signal
their newfound fluency by using the appropriate 
hesitation phenomenon. Because, contrary to popular belief, the use of filled pauses doesn't decrease
with mastery of a language. Just because hesitation phenomena
and discourse markers are a natural part of communication 
doesn’t mean they’re always appropriate. Outside of writing dialogue, they serve 
no purpose in most formal writing. And in some contexts, the stigma
these social cues carry can work against the speaker. But in most conversations, 
these seemingly senseless sounds can convey a world of meaning.

**Transcript**:
If this bat were a human,
she'd be in deep trouble. She’s infected with several
deadly viruses, including ones that cause rabies,
SARS, and Ebola. But while her diagnosis would be lethal
for other mammals, this winged wonder is totally unfazed. In fact, she may even spend
the next 30 years living as if this were totally normal–
because for bats, it is. So what’s protecting her
from these dangerous infections? To answer this question,
we first need to understand the relationship between
viruses and their hosts. Every virus has evolved to infect specific
species within a class of creatures. This is why humans are unlikely
to be infected by plant viruses, and why bees don’t catch the flu. However, viruses do sometimes jump
across closely related species And because the new host
has no established immune defenses, the unknown virus presents
a potentially lethal challenge. This is actually bad news
for the virus as well. Their ideal host provides a steady stream
of resources and comes into contact with new parties
to infect— two criteria that are best met
by living hosts. All this to say that successful viruses don’t typically evolve adaptations
that kill their hosts— including the viruses that have infected
our flying friend. The deadly effects of these viruses
aren’t caused by the pathogens directly, but rather, by their host’s uncontrolled
immune response. Infections like Ebola
or certain types of flu have evolved to strain the immune system
of their mammalian host by sending it into overdrive. The body sends hordes
of white blood cells, antibodies and inflammatory molecules
to kill the foreign invader. But if the infection has progressed
to high enough levels, an assault by the immune system
can lead to serious tissue damage. In particularly virulent cases,
this damage can be lethal. And even when it’s not, the site is left vulnerable
to secondary infection. But unlike other mammals, bats have been in an evolutionary arms
race with these viruses for millennia, and they’ve adapted to limit
this kind of self-damage. Their immune system
has a very low inflammatory response; an adaptation likely developed
alongside the other trait that sets them apart from other mammals:
self-powered flight. This energy-intensive process can raise
a bat’s body temperature to over 40ºC. Such a high metabolic rate
comes at a cost; flight produces waste molecules
called Reactive Oxygen Species that damage and break off
fragments of DNA. In other mammals, this loose DNA would be attacked by the immune system
as a foreign invader. But if bats produce these molecules
as often as researchers believe, they may have evolved
a dampened immune response to their own damaged DNA. In fact, certain genes associated
with sensing broken DNA and deploying inflammatory molecules
are absent from the bat genome. The result is a controlled
low-level inflammatory response that allows bats to coexist
with the viruses in their systems. Even more impressive, bats are able to host these viruses
for decades without any negative health consequences. According to a 2013 study, bats
have evolved efficient repair genes to counteract the frequent
DNA damage they sustain. These repair genes may also contribute
to their long lives. Animal chromosomes end with a DNA sequence
called a telomere. These sequences shorten over time
in a process that many believe contributes
to cell aging. But bat telomeres shorten much more slowly
than their mammalian cousins— granting them lifespans
as long as 41 years. Of course, bats aren’t totally
invincible to disease, whether caused by bacteria,
unfamiliar viruses, or even fungi. Bat populations have been ravaged
by a fungal infection called white-nose syndrome, which can fatally disrupt hibernation
and deteriorate wing tissue. These conditions prevent bats
from performing critical roles in their ecosystems, like helping
with pollination and seed dispersal, and consuming pests and insects. To protect these animals from harm,
and ourselves from infection, humans need to stop encroaching
on bat habitats and ecosystems. Hopefully, preserving these populations will allow scientists to better understand
bats’ unique antiviral defense systems. And maybe one day, this research will
help our own viral immunity take flight.

**Transcript**:
If this bat were a human,
she'd be in deep trouble. She’s infected with several
deadly viruses, including ones that cause rabies,
SARS, and Ebola. But while her diagnosis would be lethal
for other mammals, this winged wonder is totally unfazed. In fact, she may even spend
the next 30 years living as if this were totally normal–
because for bats, it is. So what’s protecting her
from these dangerous infections? To answer this question,
we first need to understand the relationship between
viruses and their hosts. Every virus has evolved to infect specific
species within a class of creatures. This is why humans are unlikely
to be infected by plant viruses, and why bees don’t catch the flu. However, viruses do sometimes jump
across closely related species And because the new host
has no established immune defenses, the unknown virus presents
a potentially lethal challenge. This is actually bad news
for the virus as well. Their ideal host provides a steady stream
of resources and comes into contact with new parties
to infect— two criteria that are best met
by living hosts. All this to say that successful viruses don’t typically evolve adaptations
that kill their hosts— including the viruses that have infected
our flying friend. The deadly effects of these viruses
aren’t caused by the pathogens directly, but rather, by their host’s uncontrolled
immune response. Infections like Ebola
or certain types of flu have evolved to strain the immune system
of their mammalian host by sending it into overdrive. The body sends hordes
of white blood cells, antibodies and inflammatory molecules
to kill the foreign invader. But if the infection has progressed
to high enough levels, an assault by the immune system
can lead to serious tissue damage. In particularly virulent cases,
this damage can be lethal. And even when it’s not, the site is left vulnerable
to secondary infection. But unlike other mammals, bats have been in an evolutionary arms
race with these viruses for millennia, and they’ve adapted to limit
this kind of self-damage. Their immune system
has a very low inflammatory response; an adaptation likely developed
alongside the other trait that sets them apart from other mammals:
self-powered flight. This energy-intensive process can raise
a bat’s body temperature to over 40ºC. Such a high metabolic rate
comes at a cost; flight produces waste molecules
called Reactive Oxygen Species that damage and break off
fragments of DNA. In other mammals, this loose DNA would be attacked by the immune system
as a foreign invader. But if bats produce these molecules
as often as researchers believe, they may have evolved
a dampened immune response to their own damaged DNA. In fact, certain genes associated
with sensing broken DNA and deploying inflammatory molecules
are absent from the bat genome. The result is a controlled
low-level inflammatory response that allows bats to coexist
with the viruses in their systems. Even more impressive, bats are able to host these viruses
for decades without any negative health consequences. According to a 2013 study, bats
have evolved efficient repair genes to counteract the frequent
DNA damage they sustain. These repair genes may also contribute
to their long lives. Animal chromosomes end with a DNA sequence
called a telomere. These sequences shorten over time
in a process that many believe contributes
to cell aging. But bat telomeres shorten much more slowly
than their mammalian cousins— granting them lifespans
as long as 41 years. Of course, bats aren’t totally
invincible to disease, whether caused by bacteria,
unfamiliar viruses, or even fungi. Bat populations have been ravaged
by a fungal infection called white-nose syndrome, which can fatally disrupt hibernation
and deteriorate wing tissue. These conditions prevent bats
from performing critical roles in their ecosystems, like helping
with pollination and seed dispersal, and consuming pests and insects. To protect these animals from harm,
and ourselves from infection, humans need to stop encroaching
on bat habitats and ecosystems. Hopefully, preserving these populations will allow scientists to better understand
bats’ unique antiviral defense systems. And maybe one day, this research will
help our own viral immunity take flight.

**Transcript**:
On the dusty roads of a small village, a travelling salesman was having
difficulty selling his wares. He’d recently traversed the region 
just a few weeks ago, and most of the villagers had already
seen his supply. So he wandered the outskirts of the town in the hopes of finding 
some new customers. Unfortunately, the road was largely
deserted, and the salesman was about to turn back, when he heard a high-pitched yelp
coming from the edge of the forest. Following the screams to their source,
he discovered a trapped tanuki. While these racoon-like creatures 
were known for their wily ways, this one appeared terrified and powerless. The salesman freed 
the struggling creature, but before he could tend to its wounds,
it bolted into the undergrowth. The next day, he set off 
on his usual route. As he trudged along, 
he spotted a discarded tea kettle. It was rusty and old— but perhaps 
he could sell it to the local monks. The salesman polished it 
until it sparkled and shone. He carried the kettle to Morin-ji Temple
and presented it to the solemn monks. His timing was perfect— they were in need of a large kettle
for an important service, and purchased his pot 
for a handsome price. To open the ceremony, they began 
to pour cups of tea for each monk— but the kettle cooled too quickly. It had to be reheated often throughout
the long service, and when it was hot,
it seemed to squirm in the pourer’s hand. By the end of the ceremony, the monks
felt cheated by their purchase, and called for the salesman to return 
and explain himself. The following morning, 
the salesman examined the pot, but he couldn’t find 
anything unusual about it. Hoping a cup of tea 
would help them think, they set the kettle on the fire. Within moments, the metal 
began to sweat. Suddenly, it sprouted a scrubby tail,
furry paws and pointed nose. With a yelp, the salesman recognized
the tanuki he’d freed. The salesman was shocked. He’d heard tales of shape-shifting tanuki who transformed by pulling
on their testicles. But they were usually
troublesome tricksters, who played embarrassing pranks
on travellers, or made it rain money 
that later dissolved into leaves. Some people even placed tanuki statues
outside their homes and businesses to trick potential pranksters
into taking their antics elsewhere. However, this tanuki only smiled sweetly. Why had he chosen this unsuspecting form? The tanuki explained that he wanted
to repay the salesman’s kindness. However, he’d grown too hot 
as a tea kettle, and didn’t like being burned,
scrubbed, or polished. The monk and salesman laughed, both
impressed by this honourable trickster. From that day on, the tanuki became
an esteemed guest of the temple. He could frequently be found 
telling tales and performing tricks that amused even the most serious monks. Villagers came from far away 
to see the temple tanuki, and the salesman visited often to share
tea made from an entirely normal kettle.

**Transcript**:
On the dusty roads of a small village, a travelling salesman was having
difficulty selling his wares. He’d recently traversed the region 
just a few weeks ago, and most of the villagers had already
seen his supply. So he wandered the outskirts of the town in the hopes of finding 
some new customers. Unfortunately, the road was largely
deserted, and the salesman was about to turn back, when he heard a high-pitched yelp
coming from the edge of the forest. Following the screams to their source,
he discovered a trapped tanuki. While these racoon-like creatures 
were known for their wily ways, this one appeared terrified and powerless. The salesman freed 
the struggling creature, but before he could tend to its wounds,
it bolted into the undergrowth. The next day, he set off 
on his usual route. As he trudged along, 
he spotted a discarded tea kettle. It was rusty and old— but perhaps 
he could sell it to the local monks. The salesman polished it 
until it sparkled and shone. He carried the kettle to Morin-ji Temple
and presented it to the solemn monks. His timing was perfect— they were in need of a large kettle
for an important service, and purchased his pot 
for a handsome price. To open the ceremony, they began 
to pour cups of tea for each monk— but the kettle cooled too quickly. It had to be reheated often throughout
the long service, and when it was hot,
it seemed to squirm in the pourer’s hand. By the end of the ceremony, the monks
felt cheated by their purchase, and called for the salesman to return 
and explain himself. The following morning, 
the salesman examined the pot, but he couldn’t find 
anything unusual about it. Hoping a cup of tea 
would help them think, they set the kettle on the fire. Within moments, the metal 
began to sweat. Suddenly, it sprouted a scrubby tail,
furry paws and pointed nose. With a yelp, the salesman recognized
the tanuki he’d freed. The salesman was shocked. He’d heard tales of shape-shifting tanuki who transformed by pulling
on their testicles. But they were usually
troublesome tricksters, who played embarrassing pranks
on travellers, or made it rain money 
that later dissolved into leaves. Some people even placed tanuki statues
outside their homes and businesses to trick potential pranksters
into taking their antics elsewhere. However, this tanuki only smiled sweetly. Why had he chosen this unsuspecting form? The tanuki explained that he wanted
to repay the salesman’s kindness. However, he’d grown too hot 
as a tea kettle, and didn’t like being burned,
scrubbed, or polished. The monk and salesman laughed, both
impressed by this honourable trickster. From that day on, the tanuki became
an esteemed guest of the temple. He could frequently be found 
telling tales and performing tricks that amused even the most serious monks. Villagers came from far away 
to see the temple tanuki, and the salesman visited often to share
tea made from an entirely normal kettle.
