so wouldn't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do as we're walking around being able to to point the phone at anything and then haven't actually recognized images and objects like the human brain and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of knowledge and experiences and ideas well traditionally that was seen as science fiction but now we've moved to a world where actually this has become possible so the best way of explaining it is to just show it what you can see over here is tomorrow who's holding my phone that's now plugged in so let me start with this what we have here is a painting of the great poet Robbie Burns and it's just a normal image but if we now switch inputs over to the phone running our technology you can see effectively what tamiya seeing on the screen and when she points at this image something magical happens I no matter blinks and now what's great about this is there's no trickery here there's no there's nothing done to this image and what's great about this is the technologies that she allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like other human brain does not only that but as I move the object around the book it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly again the thing that's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become all the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself now this is applications everywhere whether in things like art museums like you just saw or in the world of say advertising or print journalism so a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed here is this morning's newspaper and we have some Wimbledon news which is great now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin ring you adapt and you you have to be flexible you have to be willing to change direction at a split-second and she does all that she's won this title and that linking of the the digital content is something that's physical is what we call an aura and I'll be using that term Anila as we go through the talk so what's great about this is it isn't just a faster more convenient way to get information in the real world but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible so what I have here is a wireless fruta and my American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router so that everyone here understands but nonetheless here is the device so now what I can do is rather than getting the instructions for the device online I can simply pointed it the device is recognized and then begin by plugging in the grate it yourself cable then connect the power finally the yellow Ethernet cable congratulations you have now completed setup awesome thank you the incredible work that made that possible was done here in the UK by by scientists at Cambridge and they work in our offices and I've got a lovely picture of them here they couldn't all be on stage but we're going to bring that over to the stage so here they are they're not very animated so this was the fourth take I'm told ok so as we're talking about Cambridge let's now move on to technical advancements because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones are less than less than 12 months ago the speed and the processor in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate and that means that I can now take cinema quality 3d models and place them in the world around me so I have one over here tomorrow would you like to jump in as sleepin so then after the fun comes the more emotional side of what we do because effectively this technology allows you to see the world through someone's eyes and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world what's great about this is the tools to do this are free they're open and they're available to everyone within our application and educators have really got on board with with the classrooms so we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks teachers who've tagged up school classrooms and a great example of this is a school in the UK I have a picture here from a video and we're now going to play it now move the other side see what happens move away from it and come back to it have you got it again so it's not magic it's available for everyone to do and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right now so I sort of I'm told it's called a stadium wave so we're gonna start from this side of the room on the count of three and go over to here tomorrow are you recording okay so you all ready one two three go fellows are really good now okay now we're going to switch back into the Aurasma plication and what tomorrow's gonna do is is tag that video that we just took onto my my badge so that I can remember it forever now we have lots of people who are doing this already and we've talked a little about the educational side on the emotional side we have people who've done things like sent postcards and Christmas cards back to their family with with little messages on we have people who have for example taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more you can point and discover the information we're all very very familiar with the Internet in the last 20 years it's really changed the way that we live and work and the way that we see the world and what's great is we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift because now we can literally take the content that we share we discover and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us it's completely free to download this application if you have a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G this process is very very quick I'll play up we can save it now it's just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint and the great thing is if you're a professional user so in newspaper the tools are pretty much identical to what we've just used to create this administration the only difference is that you've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content you're now ready okay so I'm Toby ready which means we can now point at the image and there you all are well done creeping around my thankee

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what happens when Tamara points at the image of Rabbie Burns, and the correct answer is that the phone displays an animated version of the portrait that recites poetry is not present, but the concept of linking digital content to physical objects is related to Question 2.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the outcome of pointing at the image of Rabbie Burns.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what the classroom children find remarkable about the application, and the correct option is that the application tracks and overlays the content as the device is moved.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is about the technology that allows a phone to see and understand images and objects like the human brain, but it doesn't match the ground truth MCQ.

However, I noticed that the transcript mentions the technology's ability to track and overlay content seamlessly, which is similar to the correct option of the ground truth MCQ.

Although there isn't a direct match, I would suggest that Question 1 is the closest in terms of content and intent, but it would require significant rephrasing to match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, but with a caveat that it's not a direct match.

Index: 1 (with reservations)

Please note that the generated MCQs seem to focus more on the technology and its features, whereas the ground truth MCQ is more about the users' (classroom children) experience and perception of the application.

now so I sort of I'm told it's called a stadium wave so we're gonna start from this side of the room on the count of three and go over to here tomorrow are you recording okay so you all ready one two three go fellows are really good now okay now we're going to switch back into the Aurasma plication and what tomorrow's gonna do is is tag that video that we just took onto my my badge so that I can remember it forever now we have lots of people who are doing this already and we've talked a little about the educational side on the emotional side we have people who've done things like sent postcards and Christmas cards back to their family with with little messages on we have people who have for example taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more you can point and discover the information we're all very very familiar with the Internet in the last 20 years it's really

**Transcript**:
so wouldn't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do as we're walking around being able to to point the phone at anything and then haven't actually recognized images and objects like the human brain and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of knowledge and experiences and ideas well traditionally that was seen as science fiction but now we've moved to a world where actually this has become possible so the best way of explaining it is to just show it what you can see over here is tomorrow who's holding my phone that's now plugged in so let me start with this what we have here is a painting of the great poet Robbie Burns and it's just a normal image but if we now switch inputs over to the phone running our technology you can see effectively what tamiya seeing on the screen and when she points at this image something magical happens I no matter blinks and now what's great about this is there's no trickery here there's no there's nothing done to this image and what's great about this is the technologies that she allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like other human brain does not only that but as I move the object around the book it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly again the thing that's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become all the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself now this is applications everywhere whether in things like art museums like you just saw or in the world of say advertising or print journalism so a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed here is this morning's newspaper and we have some Wimbledon news which is great now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin ring you adapt and you you have to be flexible you have to be willing to change direction at a split-second and she does all that she's won this title and that linking of the the digital content is something that's physical is what we call an aura and I'll be using that term Anila as we go through the talk so what's great about this is it isn't just a faster more convenient way to get information in the real world but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible so what I have here is a wireless fruta and my American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router so that everyone here understands but nonetheless here is the device so now what I can do is rather than getting the instructions for the device online I can simply pointed it the device is recognized and then begin by plugging in the grate it yourself cable then connect the power finally the yellow Ethernet cable congratulations you have now completed setup awesome thank you the incredible work that made that possible was done here in the UK by by scientists at Cambridge and they work in our offices and I've got a lovely picture of them here they couldn't all be on stage but we're going to bring that over to the stage so here they are they're not very animated so this was the fourth take I'm told ok so as we're talking about Cambridge let's now move on to technical advancements because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones are less than less than 12 months ago the speed and the processor in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate and that means that I can now take cinema quality 3d models and place them in the world around me so I have one over here tomorrow would you like to jump in as sleepin so then after the fun comes the more emotional side of what we do because effectively this technology allows you to see the world through someone's eyes and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world what's great about this is the tools to do this are free they're open and they're available to everyone within our application and educators have really got on board with with the classrooms so we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks teachers who've tagged up school classrooms and a great example of this is a school in the UK I have a picture here from a video and we're now going to play it now move the other side see what happens move away from it and come back to it have you got it again so it's not magic it's available for everyone to do and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right

**Transcript**:
I know, insects, it's really weird, but bear with me. Now, I am an entomologist. I confess to that. And, when I look at the planet, the reason I'm an entomologist is because out of the 1.9 million species that are described on planet Earth, over 1 million of them are insects. And I truly believe as a scientist today we live in the best of times because here we are enjoying TED, and Facebook, and YouTube, and this wonderful theater, healthcare, longer life spans. But we also live in the worst of times because we are on a planet
with 7 billion people with a lot of problems. And for those of us
who look at biodiversity, it's a heart-wrenching
and wonderful time all together because we see the links
between nature and people, and we're losing them at the same time. Both honeybees and humans
originate in East Africa. And, here in Kenya, a wonderful
relationship exists where a bird called
a honeyguide, up there, has this interesting phenomenon where it actually leads either humans, which it's done for thousands of years, 77,000 year old paintings from Tanzania, and the honey badger to the wild honeybee colony. Now, for a long time
we thought this relationship first evolved between the honeyguide and the honey badger. But it turns out that it actually evolved between the human and the honeyguide, and the badger's a parasite. Now, when we look at bees, there is this amazing diversity out there, 20,000 species. And one in three bites of food that we eat is thanks to an insect pollinator. So one of the things I'm working on is looking at those links between nature and sustainable human life. And here are just
a few of the beautiful bees that we have in Kenya, in fact, not far from Nairobi. Now, how many of you like coffee? Yeah, I actually can't drink it because if I do, my hands shake, and I can't pick up ants and bees. Chocolate? I love chocolate, the darker the better, so I really like chocolate. Now the thing is,
without insect pollinators, there would be very little coffee and no chocolate on the planet. Could you imagine that? That's really scary! Now, I want to show you out of thousands of examples that I could have brought here today to show you how insects
are connected to your life, to every single human being on the planet. Here are two colleagues and friends. Domina is a farmer in Mwanza in western Tanzania, and Peter is from the Kerio Valley in northwestern Kenya. Now, Domina grows pigeon feed, cow feed, a whole wide range of legumes. And she feeds her family, she survives in a very remote area based off of these amazing crops, legumes, a lot of traditional vegetables, and all of them are pollinated by these different wild bee species. Now, Peter grows five varieties
of mango on his farm, and he actually paid for his education by growing and selling mangoes. And I really like mangoes and so it's really a great
pleasure working on the farm with five different varieties of mango. And if you look at all these
different fruits and crops here, one thing that connects us to biodiversity and one thing we do as a scientist, we write papers. We do research, and we write papers. Nobody ever reads them, but here's one of my papers. It's on the African violet. This is in the U.S. This florist sells
about 10,000 dollars worth of violets a year. It's worth about 6
billion dollars in trade. It originates in East Africa, and we never knew what pollinated it. Well, I went off and studied this. One thing to say about pollinators is it comes done to being about sex. And how many of you like sex? Where are we, the Vatican? So what happens when insects
help plants have sex is there's really good sex. This is an example of really good sex. So basically the bee comes along, it vibrates the flower at a specific frequency, 11 to 12 hertz, pollen is released, and the plant survives in the wild. This is one of the world's most endangered
plants. We go up into the deserts
of northern Kenya, which are now very famous because of the discovery of oil. But I will tell you
a little different story. These animals, the camel, which allow life in this
very remote community, are browsing off of a shrub
called indigofera, and indigofera is 100%
dependent on bee pollination. So all these wild bees
produce the indigofera, which the camels and goats eat. And we look at a community like this, Nalaray, northern Samburu, and people will look at these children and say they are poor. And I disagree because over lunch we collected
30 different bee species in the Acacia where they had their lunch and 400 pollinator species
in the Acacia tortilis where their classroom is located. So I want to leave you
with a radical piece of technology called the bee hotel that you can innovate
and build for yourself. Create a habitat where
bees can nest and live in your own backyard. But more importantly, please create space in your hearts for insects. Spend five minutes a day
with them if you can. And I believe that if the one lesson we can learn from insects is that meek shall inherit the Earth.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that Question 1 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ. Although the question is phrased differently, the intent is the same, which is to ask about the proportion or number of insect species on Earth.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of known insect species, while Question 1 asks about the percentage of species that are insects. However, the correct answer to Question 1 can be inferred from the transcript, which states that "out of the 1.9 million species that are described on planet Earth, over 1 million of them are insects." This implies that the percentage of insect species is approximately 52.6% (1 million / 1.9 million), but this option is not available.

Despite the difference in question phrasing and options, I believe that Question 1 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent and content.

I know, insects, it's really weird, but bear with me. Now, I am an entomologist. I confess to that. And, when I look at the planet, the reason I'm an entomologist is because out of the 1.9 million species that are described on planet Earth, over 1 million of them are insects. And I truly believe as a scientist today we live in the best of times because here we are enjoying TED, and Facebook, and YouTube, and this wonderful theater, healthcare, longer life spans. But we also live in the worst of times because we are on a planet
with 7 billion people with a lot of problems. And for those of us
who look at biodiversity, it's a heart-wrenching
and wonderful time all together because we see the links
between nature and people, and we're losing them at the same time. Both honeybees and humans
originate in East Africa. And, here in Kenya, a wonderful
relationship exists where a bird called
a honeyguide, up there, has this interesting phenomenon where it actually leads either humans, which it's done for thousands of years, 77,000 year old paintings from Tanzania, and the honey badger to the wild honeybee colony. Now, for a long time
we thought this relationship first evolved between the honeyguide and the honey badger. But it turns out that it actually evolved between the human and the honeyguide, and the badger's a parasite. Now, when we look at bees, there is this amazing diversity out there, 20,000 species. And one in three bites of food that we eat is thanks to an insect pollinator. So one of the things I'm working on is looking at those links between nature and sustainable human life. And here are just
a few of the beautiful bees that we have in Kenya, in fact, not far from Nairobi. Now, how many of you like coffee? Yeah, I actually can't drink it because if I do, my hands shake, and I can't pick up ants and bees. Chocolate? I love chocolate, the darker the better, so I really like chocolate. Now the thing is,
without insect pollinators, there would be very little coffee and no chocolate on the planet. Could you imagine that? That's really scary! Now, I want to show you out of thousands of examples that I could have brought here today to show you how insects
are connected to your life, to every single human being on the planet. Here are two colleagues and friends. Domina is a farmer in Mwanza in western Tanzania, and Peter is from the Kerio Valley in northwestern Kenya. Now, Domina grows pigeon feed, cow feed, a whole wide range of legumes. And she feeds her family, she survives in a very remote area based off of these amazing crops, legumes, a lot of traditional vegetables, and all of them are pollinated by these different wild bee species. Now, Peter grows five varieties
of mango on his farm, and he actually paid for his education by growing and selling mangoes. And I really like mangoes and so it's really a great
pleasure working on the farm with five different varieties of mango. And if you look at all these
different fruits and crops here, one thing that connects us to biodiversity and one thing we do as a scientist, we write papers. We do research, and we write papers. Nobody ever reads them, but here's one of my papers. It's on the African violet. This is in the U.S. This florist sells
about 10,000 dollars worth of violets a year. It's worth about 6
billion dollars in trade. It originates in East Africa, and we never knew what pollinated it. Well, I went off and studied this. One thing to say about pollinators is it comes done to being about sex. And how many of you like sex? Where are we, the Vatican? So what happens when insects
help plants have sex is there's really good sex. This is an example of really good sex. So basically the bee comes along, it vibrates the flower at a specific frequency, 11 to 12 hertz, pollen is released, and the plant survives in the wild. This is one of the world's most endangered
plants. We go up into the deserts
of northern Kenya, which are now very famous because of the discovery of oil. But I will tell you
a little different story. These animals, the camel, which allow life in this
very remote community, are browsing off of a shrub
called indigofera, and indigofera is 100%
dependent on bee pollination. So all these wild bees
produce the indigofera, which the camels and goats eat. And we look at a community like this, Nalaray, northern Samburu, and people will look at these children and say they are poor. And I disagree because over lunch we collected
30 different bee species in the Acacia where they had their lunch and 400 pollinator species
in the Acacia tortilis where their classroom is located. So I want to leave you
with a radical piece of technology called the bee hotel that you can innovate
and build for yourself. Create a habitat where
bees can nest and live in your own backyard. But more importantly, please create space in your hearts for insects. Spend five minutes a day
with them if you can. And I believe that if the one lesson we can learn from insects is that meek shall inherit the Earth.

**Transcript**:
If you wake up one morning with 1,000 times the strength
you had the night before, how will you handle
delicate day-to-day tasks? Everything must seem so fragile to you since the scale of your strength has expanded one thousand times. You'd have to be very careful when you're shaking someone's hand so you don't end up breaking their bones or crushing everyone you hug. And using a fork to pick
up a piece of broccoli from a Styrofoam plate without driving the fork through the plate is going to be as difficult
as brain surgery. Say the day comes and you get the chance
to save a damsel in distress falling from a helicopter. So, you hold out your arms, hoping to catch her. Seconds later, you will find yourself holding her lifeless body. What happened? Well, pressure is force divided by area. The smaller the area, the bigger the pressure. This is why we can lift heavy objects without breaking our skin, but a tiny needle can make us bleed with just a little poke. The pressure that will be
exerted on her body can be calculated by force divided by the area
on the top of your arms that comes in contact with her. It doesn't matter if your arms
are strong enough to catch her body
without breaking your bones. Her spine is not strong enough to be caught by you without being damaged. Even if you rip off the nearest door to provide a bigger
area to catch her with, you still wouldn't be
able to save her anyway. Remember, it's not
the fall that kills her, but the sudden stop at the bottom. Let's say she's falling
from a 32 story building, about 300 feet, and you are 6 feet tall, maybe 10 feet on your tippy-toes, with your arms above your head holding a door, in hopes of distributing the pressure across a larger surface area, but all you're doing is essentially moving the ground up by 10 feet. So, she's now falling from 290 feet, instead of 300 feet, reaching the speed of 173 feet per second just before impact, not counting air resistance. It's the equivalent of crashing
at 94 miles per hour into a wall with a door in front of it. The only thing that could
save her is flying. But that power comes with its
own host of scientific issues. If you could fly, what you must do is fly up to her, start flying down at the speed
she is falling, hold on to her, then gradually slow down until you come to a complete stop. This process requires
a lot of cushion space between the point she starts
falling and the ground. Every second you waste on changing into your superhero costume and flying up to her height, her head is getting that much
closer to the pavement! If she's falling from a high place, and you can't get to her until she's only a few feet
above the ground, there's really nothing you can do other than magically turn the pavement into marshmellow to allow her enough time
to slowly come to a stop. Then, break out the chocolate
and graham crackers and you've got s'mores. Mmmm, delicious! Now, which superpower physics lesson will you explore next? Shifting body size and content, super speed, flight, super strength, immortality, and invisibility.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Some superheroes can grow to the size of a building at will. That's very intimidating! But a scientist must ask where the extra material is coming from. The Law of Conservation of Mass implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, which means that our hero's mass will not change just
because his size changes. For instance, when we bake
a fluffy sponge cake, even though the resulting delicious treat is much bigger in size
than the cake batter that went into the oven, the weight of the cake
batter should still equal the weight of the cake plus the moisture that has evaporated. In a chemical equation, molecules rearrange to make new compounds, but all the components should
still be accounted for. When our hero expands from 6 feet tall to 18 feet tall, his height triples. Galileo's Square Cube Law says his weight will be 27 - 3 times 3 times 3 equals 27 - times his regular weight since he has to expand
in all three dimensions. So, when our superhero
transforms into a giant, we are dealing with two possibilities. Our hero towering at 18 feet still only weighs 200 pounds, the original weight in this human form. Now, option two, our hero
weighs 5,400 pounds - 200 pounds times 27
equals 5,400 pounds - when he is 18 feet tall, which means he also weighs 5,400 pounds when he is 6 feet tall. Nobody can get in the same
elevator with him without the alarm going off. Now, option two seems a little more scientifically plausible, but it begs the question, how does he ever walk through the park without sinking into the ground since the pressure
he is exerting on the soil is calculated by his mass divided by the area
of the bottom of his feet? And what kind of super
socks and super shoes is he putting on his feet
to withstand all the friction that results from dragging
his 5,400 pound body against the road when he runs? And can he even run? And I won't even ask how he finds pants flexible enough to withstand
the expansion. Now, let's explore the density of the two options mentioned above. Density is defined as mass
divided by volume. The human body is made
out of bones and flesh, which has a relatively set density. In option one, if the hero
weighs 200 pounds all the time, then he would be bones
and flesh at normal size. When he expands to a bigger size while still weighing 200 pounds, he essentially turns himself into a giant, fluffy teddy bear. In option two, if the hero weighs 5,400 pounds all the time, then he would be bones
and flesh at 18 feet with 5,400 pounds of weight
supported by two legs. The weight would be
exerted on the leg bones at different angles as he moves. Bones, while hard, are not malleable, meaning they do not bend, so they break easily. The tendons would also
be at risk of tearing. Tall buildings stay standing because they have steel frames and do not run and jump
around in the jungle. Our hero, on the other hand, one landing at a bad angle and he's down. Assuming his bodily function
is the same as any mammal's, his heart would need to pump
a large amount of blood throughout his body
to provide enough oxygen for him to move 5,400 pounds
of body weight around. This would take tremendous energy, which he would need to provide by consuming 27 times 3,000
calories of food every day. Now, that is roughly 150 Big Macs. 27 times 3,000 calculated equals 81,000 calculated slash 550 calories equals 147. He wouldn't have time to fight crime because he would be eating all the time and working a 9-to-5 job in order to afford all the food he eats. And what about superheroes who can turn their bodies
into rocks or sand? Well, everything on Earth
is made out of elements. And what defines each element is the number of protons in the nucleus. That is how our periodic
table is organized. Hydrogen has one proton, helium, two protons, lithium, three protons, and so on. The primary component
of the most common form of sand is silicon dioxide. Meanwhile, the human body consists of 65% oxygen, 18% carbon, 10% hydrogen, and 7% of various other elements including 0.002% of silicon. In a chemical reaction, the elements recombine
to make new compounds. So, where is he getting all this silicon necessary to make the sand? Sure, we can alter elements by nuclear fusion or nuclear fission. However, nuclear fusion
requires so much heat, the only natural occurrence
of this process is in stars. In order to utilize fusion
in a short amount of time, the temperature of the area needs to be hotter than the Sun. Every innocent bystander
will be burned to a crisp. Rapid nuclear fission is not any better since it often results
in many radioactive particles. Our hero would become a walking, talking nuclear power plant, ultimately harming
every person he tries to save. And do you really want the heat of the Sun or a radioactive nuclear
plant inside of your body? Now, which superpower physics lesson will you explore next? Shifting body size and content, super speed, flight, super strength, immortality, and invisibility.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the properties of bones, specifically their malleability. While none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic, some of them do discuss the physical limitations and challenges faced by superheroes with extraordinary abilities.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3. However, this question is not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable approach would be to create a new MCQ that directly addresses the topic of bone malleability, such as:

Question: What is a characteristic of bones that makes them prone to breaking?
Options: A. They are too dense, B. They are too light, C. They are not malleable, D. They are too flexible

This new MCQ is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

transforms into a giant, we are dealing with two possibilities. Our hero towering at 18 feet still only weighs 200 pounds, the original weight in this human form. Now, option two, our hero
weighs 5,400 pounds - 200 pounds times 27
equals 5,400 pounds - when he is 18 feet tall, which means he also weighs 5,400 pounds when he is 6 feet tall. Nobody can get in the same
elevator with him without the alarm going off. Now, option two seems a little more scientifically plausible, but it begs the question, how does he ever walk through the park without sinking into the ground since the pressure
he is exerting on the soil is calculated by his mass divided by the area
of the bottom of his feet? And what kind of super
socks and super shoes is he putting on his feet
to withstand all the friction that results from dragging
his 5,400 pound body against the road when he runs? And can he even run? And I won't even ask how he finds pants flexible enough to withstand
the expansion. Now, let's explore the density of the two options mentioned above. Density is defined as mass
divided by volume. The human body is made
out of bones and flesh, which has a relatively set density. In option one, if the hero
weighs 200 pounds all the time, then he would be bones
and flesh at normal size. When he expands to a bigger size while still weighing 200 pounds, he essentially turns himself into a giant, fluffy teddy bear. In option two, if the hero weighs 5,400 pounds all the time, then he would be bones
and flesh at 18 feet with 5,400 pounds of weight
supported by two legs. The weight would be
exerted on the leg bones at different angles as he moves. Bones, while hard, are not malleable, meaning they do not bend, so they break easily. The tendons would also
be at risk of tearing. Tall buildings stay standing because they have steel frames and do not run and jump
around in the jungle. Our hero, on the other hand, one landing at a bad angle and he's down. Assuming his bodily function
is the same as any mammal's, his heart would need to pump
a large amount of blood throughout his body
to provide enough oxygen for him to move 5,400 pounds
of body weight around. This would take tremendous energy, which he would need to provide by consuming 27 times 3,000
calories of food every day. Now, that is roughly 150 Big Macs. 27 times 3,000 calculated equals 81,000 calculated slash 550 calories equals 147. He wouldn't have time to fight crime because he would be eating all the time and working a 9-to-5 job in order to afford all the food he eats. And what about superheroes who can turn their bodies
into rocks or sand? Well, everything on Earth
is made out of elements. And what defines each element is the number of protons in the nucleus. That is how our periodic
table is organized. Hydrogen has one proton, helium, two protons, lithium, three protons, and so on. The primary component
of the most common form of sand is silicon dioxide. Meanwhile, the human body consists of 65% oxygen, 18% carbon, 10% hydrogen, and 7% of various other elements including 0.002% of silicon. In a chemical reaction, the elements recombine
to make new compounds. So, where is he getting all this silicon necessary to make the sand? Sure, we can alter elements by nuclear fusion or nuclear fission. However, nuclear fusion
requires so much heat, the only natural occurrence
of this process is in stars. In order to utilize fusion
in a short amount of time, the temperature of the area needs to be hotter than the Sun. Every innocent bystander
will be burned to a crisp. Rapid nuclear fission is not any better since it often results
in many radioactive particles. Our hero would become a walking, talking nuclear power plant, ultimately harming
every person he tries to save. And do you really want the heat of the Sun or a radioactive nuclear
plant inside of your body? Now, which superpower physics lesson will you explore next? Shifting body size and content, super speed, flight, super strength, immortality, and invisibility.

**Transcript**:
Some superheroes can grow to the size of a building at will. That's very intimidating! But a scientist must ask where the extra material is coming from. The Law of Conservation of Mass implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, which means that our hero's mass will not change just
because his size changes. For instance, when we bake
a fluffy sponge cake, even though the resulting delicious treat is much bigger in size
than the cake batter that went into the oven, the weight of the cake
batter should still equal the weight of the cake plus the moisture that has evaporated. In a chemical equation, molecules rearrange to make new compounds, but all the components should
still be accounted for. When our hero expands from 6 feet tall to 18 feet tall, his height triples. Galileo's Square Cube Law says his weight will be 27 - 3 times 3 times 3 equals 27 - times his regular weight since he has to expand
in all three dimensions. So, when our superhero

**Transcript**:
Imagine yourself standing on a beach, looking out over the ocean, waves crashing against the shore, blue as far as your eyes can see. Let it really sink in, the sheer scope and size of it all. Now, ask yourself, "How big is it? How big is the ocean?" First thing, we need to understand
that there really is only one ocean, consisting of five component
basins that we call the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian,
the Arctic, and the Southern. Each of these five, while generally referred to as oceans in and of themselves, are really and truly a part of a single,
massive body of water, one ocean, which defines the very face
of planet Earth. The ocean covers roughly 71%
of our planet's surface, some 360 million square kilometers, an area in excess
of the size of 36 USAs. It’s such a vast spread,
when viewed from space, the ocean is, by far,
the dominant feature of our planet. Speaking of space, the ocean currently
holds over 1.3 billion— that’s billion with a “b”— cubic kilometers of water. Put another way, that’s enough water to immerse
the entire United States under a body of salt water
over 132 kilometers tall— a height well beyond the reach
of the highest clouds and extending deep
into the upper atmosphere. With all that volume, the ocean represents 97%
of Earth’s total water content. On top of all that, the ocean contains upwards of 99%
of the world’s biosphere, that is, the spaces and places
where life exists. Now let that sink in for a second. The immediate world as we know it, indeed the totality
of all the living space encompassed by the continents themselves, all of that represents only 1%
of the biosphere— 1%! The ocean is everything else. So, the ocean is physically massive. It's importance to life
is practically unparalleled. It also happens to hold the greatest
geological features of our planet. Quickly, here are four
of the most notable. The ocean contains
the world's largest mountain range, the mid-ocean ridge. At roughly 65,000 kilometers long, this underwater range is some 10 times
longer than the longest mountain chain found purely on dry land—
the Andes. Beneath the Denmark Strait exists
the world’s largest waterfall. This massive cataract carries
roughly 116 times more water per second over its edge
than the Congo River’s Inga Falls, the largest waterfall by volume on land. The world's tallest mountain
is actually found in the ocean, hiding in plain sight. While 4,200 meters of Hawaii’s Mauna Kea
sit above sea level, its sides plummet beneath the waves
for another 5,800 meters. From its snow-covered top
to it’s silt-covered bottom, then, this Hawaiian mountain is roughly
10,000 meters in height, dwarfing tiny Everest’s paltry peak
by well over a kilometer. And, since we’re picking on poor Everest, let's consider the world's deepest canyon, the Challenger Deep: existing 11 kilometers
below the ocean's surface, some six times deeper
than the Grand Canyon. That's deep enough to sink
Mount Everest into and still have over 2.1 kilometers
of water sitting atop its newly submerged peak. Put another way, the depth
of the Challenger Deep is roughly the same height
that commercial airliners travel. So, pretty much however
you choose to slice it, the ocean is capital B, capital I,
capital G— BIG! It defines our planet, home to the greatest geological features, comprises the largest living space, and accordingly, is home to the greatest
numbers and forms of life on Earth. It is practically incomprehensible
in scope. But it is not so big, so vast,
so extraordinary as to be untouchable. In fact, with roughly 50%
of the world's population living within 100 kilometers
of a coastline, and with most of the remainder living close enough to lakes,
rivers, or swamps, all of which ultimately lead to the ocean, virtually every single
person on the planet has the opportunity to influence
the general health and nature of the world ocean. Evidence of human influence is seen
in every part of the ocean, no matter how deep,
no matter how distant. The ocean defines our planet, but, in a very real sense, we define the ocean.

The generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 5: What is the name of the world's largest mountain range, which is located underwater? Options: A. The Andes, B. The Himalayas, C. The mid-ocean ridge, D. The Rocky Mountains

However, this question does not directly address the concept of the "One Ocean" and instead asks about a specific geological feature mentioned in the transcript.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to pick one that is somewhat related, I would choose index 5. Nevertheless, I would like to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ could be:

Question: What does the term "One Ocean" refer to? Options: A. The Pacific Ocean, B. The Atlantic Ocean, C. The Indian Ocean, D. All of the world's oceans combined, E. The Southern Ocean

However, this question is not present among the generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
Imagine yourself standing on a beach, looking out over the ocean, waves crashing against the shore, blue as far as your eyes can see. Let it really sink in, the sheer scope and size of it all. Now, ask yourself, "How big is it? How big is the ocean?" First thing, we need to understand
that there really is only one ocean, consisting of five component
basins that we call the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian,
the Arctic, and the Southern. Each of these five, while generally referred to as oceans in and of themselves, are really and truly a part of a single,
massive body of water, one ocean, which defines the very face
of planet Earth. The ocean covers roughly 71%
of our planet's surface, some 360 million square kilometers, an area in excess
of the size of 36 USAs. It’s such a vast spread,
when viewed from space, the ocean is, by far,
the dominant feature of our planet. Speaking of space, the ocean currently
holds over 1.3 billion— that’s billion with a “b”— cubic kilometers of water. Put another way, that’s enough water to immerse
the entire United States under a body of salt water
over 132 kilometers tall— a height well beyond the reach
of the highest clouds and extending deep
into the upper atmosphere. With all that volume, the ocean represents 97%
of Earth’s total water content. On top of all that, the ocean contains upwards of 99%
of the world’s biosphere, that is, the spaces and places
where life exists. Now let that sink in for a second. The immediate world as we know it, indeed the totality
of all the living space encompassed by the continents themselves, all of that represents only 1%
of the biosphere— 1%! The ocean is everything else. So, the ocean is physically massive. It's importance to life
is practically unparalleled. It also happens to hold the greatest
geological features of our planet. Quickly, here are four
of the most notable. The ocean contains
the world's largest mountain range, the mid-ocean ridge. At roughly 65,000 kilometers long, this underwater range is some 10 times
longer than the longest mountain chain found purely on dry land—
the Andes. Beneath the Denmark Strait exists
the world’s largest waterfall. This massive cataract carries
roughly 116 times more water per second over its edge
than the Congo River’s Inga Falls, the largest waterfall by volume on land. The world's tallest mountain
is actually found in the ocean, hiding in plain sight. While 4,200 meters of Hawaii’s Mauna Kea
sit above sea level, its sides plummet beneath the waves
for another 5,800 meters. From its snow-covered top
to it’s silt-covered bottom, then, this Hawaiian mountain is roughly
10,000 meters in height, dwarfing tiny Everest’s paltry peak
by well over a kilometer. And, since we’re picking on poor Everest, let's consider the world's deepest canyon, the Challenger Deep: existing 11 kilometers
below the ocean's surface, some six times deeper
than the Grand Canyon. That's deep enough to sink
Mount Everest into and still have over 2.1 kilometers
of water sitting atop its newly submerged peak. Put another way, the depth
of the Challenger Deep is roughly the same height
that commercial airliners travel. So, pretty much however
you choose to slice it, the ocean is capital B, capital I,
capital G— BIG! It defines our planet, home to the greatest geological features, comprises the largest living space, and accordingly, is home to the greatest
numbers and forms of life on Earth. It is practically incomprehensible
in scope. But it is not so big, so vast,
so extraordinary as to be untouchable. In fact, with roughly 50%
of the world's population living within 100 kilometers
of a coastline, and with most of the remainder living close enough to lakes,
rivers, or swamps, all of which ultimately lead to the ocean, virtually every single
person on the planet has the opportunity to influence
the general health and nature of the world ocean. Evidence of human influence is seen
in every part of the ocean, no matter how deep,
no matter how distant. The ocean defines our planet, but, in a very real sense, we define the ocean.

**Transcript**:
a couple of years ago when I was attending the TED conference in Long Beach I met Harriet now we'd actually met online before you know not the way you're thinking we were actually introduced because we both knew Linda av one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies and because we shared our genetic information with Linda she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA haplotype K 1 a 1 B 1 a which meant that we were distantly related we actually shared the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman so Ozzie Harriet and me and being the current day of course we start our own Facebook group you're all welcome to join and when I met Harriet and person the next year at the TED conference she'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype t-shirts now why am I telling you this story what does this have to do with the future of health well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bioinformatics to the connection of the internet and social networking what I like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies you know we often think linearly but if you think about it if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day 2 4 8 16 15 days of 32,000 what do you think you have in a month or at a billion so if we start to think exponentially we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us and many of these technologies speaking as a physician and innovator we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of healthcare and to address many of the major challenges that we have in healthcare today ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population the way we really don't use information very well today the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation and one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left we spend most of our money on the last 20% of life what if we get spend and incentivize physicians and healthcare system in our own self to move the curve to left improve our health leveraging technology as well now my favorite technology example of exponential technology we all have in our pocket so if you just think about it these are really dramatically improving I mean this is the iPhone 4 imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do now I've gained some insight into this I've been the track chair for the medicine portion of a new institution called singularity University based in Silicon Valley and we bring together each summer about 100 very talented students from around the world and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine biotech artificial intelligence robotics nanotechnology space and address how could cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals we also have seven-day executive programs and coming up next month is actually future mat a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine now I mentioned the phone these mobile phones have over I think 20,000 different mobile apps available to the point where there's one out of the UK where you can pee in a little chip connect it to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD and I try that yet but that's available there other sorts of applications merging your phone and diagnostics for example measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that Prudential e to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic so let's see now how exponential technologies are taking healthcare let's start with faster well it's no secret that computers through Moore's law are speeding up faster and faster we have the ability to do more powerful things with them they're really approaching in many cases surpassing the ability of the human mind but what I think computational speed is most applicable is that of imaging the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible we're layering multiple technologies PET scan CT scans and molecular diagnostics to find and seek things at different levels here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done to date reconstructed of Bartho - the curator of TEDMED and now we can see inside of the brain at a resolution and ability that was never before available and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even re-engineer or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand pathology disease and therapy we can look at side with real-time fMRI in the brain at real-time and by understanding these sorts of processes in these connections we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective for example psychoactive drugs the scanners for these are getting smaller and less expensive and more portable and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge the scan of today takes up about 800 books or 20 gigabytes the scan of just in a couple years will be one terabyte or 800,000 books how do we leverage the information let's get personal I won't ask you here's how to colonoscopy but if you're over age 50 it's time for your screening colonoscopy how would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick well now there's essentially virtual colonoscopy compare those two pictures and now as the radiologist you can Sochi fly through your patients calling and augmenting that with artificial intelligence identify potential as you see here a lesion that we might have missed it but using AI on top of radiology we can find lesions that were missed before and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise and this is an example this paradigm shift we're moving to this integration of biomedicine information technology wireless and I would say mobile now this era of digital medicine so even my stethoscope is now digital and of course there's an app for that we're moving obviously to the era of the tricorder so the handheld ultrasound is facially surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope these are now at a price point of what used to be a hundred thousand euros or a couple hundred thousand dollars for about five thousand dollars I can have the power with very powerful diagnostic device in my hand and merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records in the United States we're still less than 20% electronic here in the Netherlands I think it's more than 80% but now that we're switching to merging medical data making it available electronically we can crowdsource that information and now as a physician I can access my patients data from wherever I am just through my mobile device and now of course we're in the era of the iPad even the iPad 2 and just last month the first fda-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices so certainly the physicians of the day including myself are completely reliable on these devices and as you saw just about a month ago Watson from IBM beat the two champions in jeopardy so I want you to imagine we're in a couple years we start to apply this cloud-based information well we really have the AI physician and leverage our own brains and connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done RT today you don't need to go to visit your physician in many cases only about 20% of actual visits you need to lay hands on the patient we're now in the era of virtual visits from sort of the Skype type visits you can do with American well to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system the ability to interact with your healthcare provider is different and these are on being augmented even by our devices again today here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room I can do some Diagnostics in that way or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology like the Microsoft Kinect and hack that to enable let's say Diagnostics for example in diagnosing stroke using simple motion detection using $100 devices we can actually now visit our patients robotically this is the rp7 if I'm a hematologist visit another clinic for visit a hospital these are being augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now so imagine we already have wireless scales you can step on the scale you can tweet your way to your friends and they can keep you in line we out wireless blood pressure cuffs a whole gamut of these technologies are being put together so instead of wearing these glue G devices we can put on a simple this is developed by colleagues at Stanford called the eye rhythm completely supplants the prior technology and a much lower price point with much more effective 'ti now we're also in the ear today of quantified self consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices like this little Fitbit I can measure my steps my caloric outtake I can get insight to that on a daily basis I can share that with my friends with my physician there's watches coming now that I'll measure your heart rate Zeo sleep monitors all suite of tools that can able get a leverage and have insight into your own health and if we start to integrate this information we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies health and wellness there's even mirrors today I can pick up your pulse rate and I would argue in the future we'll have wearable devices in our clothes modern in ourselves 24/7 and just like we have the OnStar system in cars your red light might go on and once a check engine light it's going to be check your body light and go in and get and take care of and probably in a few years we'll check in to your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you okay for those of you with with kiddos at home how would you like to have the the wireless diaper that sir supports here too much information I think that you might need but it's it's gonna be here now we've heard a lot today about technology and connection and I think actually some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of Medicine as augmented by these sorts of technologies now we talk about augmenting the patient to some degree how about augmenting the physician we're now near super labeling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery which is here today at a level that was not really possible even five years ago and now this has been automated further layers of technology like augmented reality so the surgeon can see inside the patient through their lens where the tumor is where the blood vessels are this can be integrated with decision support a surgeon in New York and be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam for example and we're entering era a really truly scarless surgery called notes where the endoscope robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all on a scarless wedding and robotically and this is called notes and this is coming basically scarless surgery is mediated by robotic surgery now how about controlling other elements for those who have disabilities the paraplegic there's the ear of brain computer interface or BCI where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a cursor or a wheelchair or initially a robotic arm and these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients still in clinical trials but imagine when we can connect these for example to the amazing bionic limb such as those of the DECA arm built by Dean Kaman and colleagues which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they've had in the past so we're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually if you haven't lost a limb you've had a stroke for example you can wear these augmented lambs or if you're a paraplegic like I visited the folks at Brooklyn bionics they've developed a legs I took this video last week here's a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons these otherwise complete world's you're bound and now this is the early era of wearable robotics and I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies we're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be super ability or super enabling this is Aimee Mullins who lost her lower limbs as a young child and Hugh her who is a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident and now both of these can climb better move faster swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal abled persons now how about other Exponential's consider the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction including with huge costs but the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller so a few examples we're now in the era of Fantastic Voyage the eye pill you can swallow this completely integrated device it can take pictures of your GI system help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract we need to even smaller micro robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons can't do in much less invasive manner sometimes it might have self-assemble in your GI system and be augmented that reality on the cardiac side pacemakers are getting small are much easier to place so you don't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them and they're going to be wirelessly to limit it again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely these are shrinking even further here's one that's in prototyping by Medtronic that's smaller than a penny artificial retinas the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see again in early trials but moving into the future these are going to be gained changing or for those of us who are sighted how about having the assisted living contact lens Bluetooth Wi-Fi available beams back images to your eye now if you have trouble maintaining your diet it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you how about enabling the pathologist to use their cellphone again to see at a microscopic level and tell ember that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics in fact the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing we can now leveraging micro fluidics like this chip made by Steve quake at Stanford micro fluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians and put it on a chip enable thousands of tests to be done at the point-of-care anywhere in the world and this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the underserved and unable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point-of-care if we go down the small pathway a little bit further we're learning the era of nano medicine the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or micro robots that will monitor our blood system or immune system or even those that might even clear out the class from our arteries now how about exponentially cheaper not something we usually think about in the era of medicine that hard just used to be $3,400 for 10 megabytes expletive cheaper in genomics now the genome cost about a billion dollars about ten years ago when the first one came out we're now approaching essentially a thousand dollar genome probably next year in two years about a hundred dollar genome what are we going to do with hundred dollar genomes and soon we'll have millions of these tests available and that's when it gets interesting when we start to crowdsource that information and we enter the era of true personalized medicine the right drug for the right person at the right time instead of what we're doing today which is essentially the same drug for everybody so two blockbuster drug medications many cases which don't work for you the individual and many many different companies are working on on leveraging these approaches and I'll just show you a simple example from 20 through me again my data indicates that I've got by average risk for developing macular degeneration two kind of blindness but if I take that same data upload it to decode me I can look at my risk for example type 2 diabetes I'm at almost twice the risk for type 2 diabetes I might want to watch how much dessert I have the lunch break for example it might change my behavior leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenetics how my genes modulate what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important and what's in the hands of the individual and the patient will make better drug dosing and selection available so again it's not just genes it's multiple details our habits our environmental exposures when was the last time your physician asked you where you've lived geo medicine where you live what you've been exposed to can dramatically affect your health we can capture that information so genomics proteomics the environment all this data streaming at us individually and as us as poor physicians how do we manage it well we're now entering the era of systems medicine or systems biology where we can start to integrate all this information and by looking at the patterns for example in our blood of 10,000 biomarkers at a single test we can start to look with these little patterns and detect disease in a much earlier stage and this is being called by Li hood the father of the fear of p4 medicine we're going to be predictive we're going to know what you're likely to have we can be preventive that prevention can be personalized and more importantly it's going to become increasingly participatory through websites like patients like me or managing your data on a Microsoft Health fault or a Google health leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important so I'll finish up with exponentially better we'd like to get therapies better and more effective now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills what if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that me delayed blood pressure and a single therapy basically cure hypertension this is a new device that essentially is doing that that should be on the market within a year or two how about more targeted therapies for cancer right I'm an oncologist and I know today most of what we give is essentially poison we've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover it cancer stem cells so once it seemed to be really responsible for disease relapse so if you think of cancer as a weed we often can whack the weed away it seems to shrink it often comes back so we're tacking the wrong target the cancer stem cells remain and the tumor can return months or years later we're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure and we're ending the era of personalized oncology the ability to leverage all this data together analyze the tumor and come up with a real specific cocktail for the individual patient now I'll close with regenerative medicine so I've studied a lot about stem cells embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful we also have adult stem cells throughout our body we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation Geron just last year start of the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries still a phase one trial but evolving we've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics particularly in treating cardiovascular disease if we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack I invented a bicycle the marrow miner a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow it's now been FDA approved and will hopefully be on the market in the next year so hopefully you can appreciate the device that are curving through the patient's body and removing the bone marrow instead of with 200 punctures which is a single puncture under local anesthesia but where stem cell therapy really going if you think about it every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo we can have reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient making your own personalized stem cell lines and I think there'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to you know have in the freezer your own cardiac cells myocytes neural cells to use them in the future should you need them and we're integrating this now with a whole year of cellular engineering and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3d organ that's where things are going to head still very early days but I think as integration of exponential technologies this is the example so enclosed as you think about technology turns on how to impact health and medicine we're entering an era of miniaturization decentralization and personalization and I think by pulling these things together we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these we're going to empower the patient enable the doctor enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick because I know as a doctor if someone comes to me with stage one disease I'm thrilled we can often cure them but often is too late and it's stage three or four cancer for example so by leveraging these technologies together I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call stage zero medicine and as a cancer doctor I'm looking forward to being out of a job thanks very much

**Transcript**:
a couple of years ago when I was attending the TED conference in Long Beach I met Harriet now we'd actually met online before you know not the way you're thinking we were actually introduced because we both knew Linda av one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies and because we shared our genetic information with Linda she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA haplotype K 1 a 1 B 1 a which meant that we were distantly related we actually shared the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman so Ozzie Harriet and me and being the current day of course we start our own Facebook group you're all welcome to join and when I met Harriet and person the next year at the TED conference she'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype t-shirts now why am I telling you this story what does this have to do with the future of health well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bioinformatics to the connection of the internet and social networking what I like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies you know we often think linearly but if you think about it if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day 2 4 8 16 15 days of 32,000 what do you think you have in a month or at a billion so if we start to think exponentially we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us and many of these technologies speaking as a physician and innovator we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of healthcare and to address many of the major challenges that we have in healthcare today ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population the way we really don't use information very well today the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation and one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left we spend most of our money on the last 20% of life what if we get spend and incentivize physicians and healthcare system in our own self to move the curve to left improve our health leveraging technology as well now my favorite technology example of exponential technology we all have in our pocket so if you just think about it these are really dramatically improving I mean this is the iPhone 4 imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do now I've gained some insight into this I've been the track chair for the medicine portion of a new institution called singularity University based in Silicon Valley and we bring together each summer about 100 very talented students from around the world and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine biotech artificial intelligence robotics nanotechnology space and address how could cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals we also have seven-day executive programs and coming up next month is actually future mat a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine now I mentioned the phone these mobile phones have over I think 20,000 different mobile apps available to the point where there's one out of the UK where you can pee in a little chip connect it to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD and I try that yet but that's available there other sorts of applications merging your phone and diagnostics for example measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that Prudential e to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic so let's see now how exponential technologies are taking healthcare let's start with faster well it's no secret that computers through Moore's law are speeding up faster and faster we have the ability to do more powerful things with them they're really approaching in many cases surpassing the ability of the human mind but what I think computational speed is most applicable is that of imaging the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible we're layering multiple technologies PET scan CT scans and molecular diagnostics to find and seek things at different levels here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done to date reconstructed of Bartho - the curator of TEDMED and now we can see inside of the brain at a resolution and ability that was never before available and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even re-engineer or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand pathology disease and therapy we can look at side with real-time fMRI in the brain at real-time and by understanding these sorts of processes in these connections we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective for example psychoactive drugs the scanners for these are getting smaller and less expensive and more portable and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge the scan of today takes up about 800 books or 20 gigabytes the scan of just in a couple years will be one terabyte or 800,000 books how do we leverage the information let's get personal I won't ask you here's how to colonoscopy but if you're over age 50 it's time for your screening colonoscopy how would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick well now there's essentially virtual colonoscopy compare those two pictures and now as the radiologist you can Sochi fly through your patients calling and augmenting that with artificial intelligence identify potential as you see here a lesion that we might have missed it but using AI on top of radiology we can find lesions that were missed before and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise and this is an example this paradigm shift we're moving to this integration of biomedicine information technology wireless and I would say mobile now this era of digital medicine so even my stethoscope is now digital and of course there's an app for that we're moving obviously to the era of the tricorder so the handheld ultrasound is facially surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope these are now at a price point of what used to be a hundred thousand euros or a couple hundred thousand dollars for about five thousand dollars I can have the power with very powerful diagnostic device in my hand and merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records in the United States we're still less than 20% electronic here in the Netherlands I think it's more than 80% but now that we're switching to merging medical data making it available electronically we can crowdsource that information and now as a physician I can access my patients data from wherever I am just through my mobile device and now of course we're in the era of the iPad even the iPad 2 and just last month the first fda-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices so certainly the physicians of the day including myself are completely reliable on these devices and as you saw just about a month ago Watson from IBM beat the two champions in jeopardy so I want you to imagine we're in a couple years we start to apply this cloud-based information well we really have the AI physician and leverage our own brains and connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done RT today you don't need to go to visit your physician in many cases only about 20% of actual visits you need to lay hands on the patient we're now in the era of virtual visits from sort of the Skype type visits you can do with American well to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system the ability to interact with your healthcare provider is different and these are on being augmented even by our devices again today here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room I can do some Diagnostics in that way or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology like the Microsoft Kinect and hack that to enable let's say Diagnostics for example in diagnosing stroke using simple motion detection using $100 devices we can actually now visit our patients robotically this is the rp7 if I'm a hematologist visit another clinic for visit a hospital these are being augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now so imagine we already have wireless scales you can step on the scale you can tweet your way to your friends and they can keep you in line we out wireless blood pressure cuffs a whole gamut of these technologies are being put together so instead of wearing these glue G devices we can put on a simple this is developed by colleagues at Stanford called the eye rhythm completely supplants the prior technology and a much lower price point with much more effective 'ti now we're also in the ear today of quantified self consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices like this little Fitbit I can measure my steps my caloric outtake I can get insight to that on a daily basis I can share that with my friends with my physician there's watches coming now that I'll measure your heart rate Zeo sleep monitors all suite of tools that can able get a leverage and have insight into your own health and if we start to integrate this information we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies health and wellness there's even mirrors today I can pick up your pulse rate and I would argue in the future we'll have wearable devices in our clothes modern in ourselves 24/7 and just like we have the OnStar system in cars your red light might go on and once a check engine light it's going to be check your body light and go in and get and take care of and probably in a few years we'll check in to your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you okay for those of you with with kiddos at home how would you like to have the the wireless diaper that sir supports here too much information I think that you might need but it's it's gonna be here now we've

I've studied a lot about stem cells embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful we also have adult stem cells throughout our body we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation Geron just last year start of the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries still a phase one trial but evolving we've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics particularly in treating cardiovascular disease if we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack I invented a bicycle the marrow miner a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow it's now been FDA approved and will hopefully be on the market in the next year so hopefully you can appreciate the device that are curving through the patient's body and removing the bone marrow instead of with 200 punctures which is a single puncture under local anesthesia but where stem cell therapy really going if you think about it every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo we can have reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient making your own personalized stem cell lines and I think there'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to you know have in the freezer your own cardiac cells myocytes neural cells to use them in the future should you need them and we're integrating this now with a whole year of cellular engineering and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3d organ that's where things are going to head still very early days but I think as integration of exponential technologies this is the example so enclosed as you think about technology turns on how to impact health and medicine we're entering an era of miniaturization decentralization and personalization and I think by pulling these things together we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these we're going to empower the patient enable the doctor enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick because I know as a doctor if someone comes to me with stage one disease I'm thrilled we can often cure them but often is too late and it's stage three or four cancer for example so by leveraging these technologies together I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call stage zero medicine and as a cancer doctor I'm looking forward to being out of a job thanks very much

**Transcript**:
a couple of years ago when I was attending the TED conference in Long Beach I met Harriet now we'd actually met online before you know not the way you're thinking we were actually introduced because we both knew Linda av one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies and because we shared our genetic information with Linda she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA haplotype K 1 a 1 B 1 a which meant that we were distantly related we actually shared the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman so Ozzie Harriet and me and being the current day of course we start our own Facebook group you're all welcome to join and when I met Harriet and person the next year at the TED conference she'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype t-shirts now why am I telling you this story what does this have to do with the future of health well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bioinformatics to the connection of the internet and social networking what I like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies you know we often think linearly but if you think about it if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day 2 4 8 16 15 days of 32,000 what do you think you have in a month or at a billion so if we start to think exponentially we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us and many of these technologies speaking as a physician and innovator we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of healthcare and to address many of the major challenges that we have in healthcare today ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population the way we really don't use information very well today the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation and one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left we spend most of our money on the last 20% of life what if we get spend and incentivize physicians and healthcare system in our own self to move the curve to left improve our health leveraging technology as well now my favorite technology example of exponential technology we all have in our pocket so if you just think about it these are really dramatically improving I mean this is the iPhone 4 imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do now I've gained some insight into this I've been the track chair for the medicine portion of a new institution called singularity University based in Silicon Valley and we bring together each summer about 100 very talented students from around the world and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine biotech artificial intelligence robotics nanotechnology space and address how could cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals we also have seven-day executive programs and coming up next month is actually future mat a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine now I mentioned the phone these mobile phones have over I think 20,000 different mobile apps available to the point where there's one out of the UK where you can pee in a little chip connect it to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD and I try that yet but that's available there other sorts of applications merging your phone and diagnostics for example measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that Prudential e to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic so let's see now how exponential technologies are taking healthcare let's start with faster well it's no secret that computers through Moore's law are speeding up faster and faster we have the ability to do more powerful things with them they're really approaching in many cases surpassing the ability of the human mind but what I think computational speed is most applicable is that of imaging the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible we're layering multiple technologies PET scan CT scans and molecular diagnostics to find and seek things at different levels here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done to date reconstructed of Bartho - the curator of TEDMED and now we can see inside of the brain at a resolution and ability that was never before available and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even re-engineer or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand pathology disease and therapy we can look at side with real-time fMRI in the brain at real-time and by understanding these sorts of processes in these connections we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective for example psychoactive drugs the scanners for these are getting smaller and less expensive and more portable and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge the scan of today takes up about 800 books or 20 gigabytes the scan of just in a couple years will be one terabyte or 800,000 books how do we leverage the information let's get personal I won't ask you here's how to colonoscopy but if you're over age 50 it's time for your screening colonoscopy how would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick well now there's essentially virtual colonoscopy compare those two pictures and now as the radiologist you can Sochi fly through your patients calling and augmenting that with artificial intelligence identify potential as you see here a lesion that we might have missed it but using AI on top of radiology we can find lesions that were missed before and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise and this is an example this paradigm shift we're moving to this integration of biomedicine information technology wireless and I would say mobile now this era of digital medicine so even my stethoscope is now digital and of course there's an app for that we're moving obviously to the era of the tricorder so the handheld ultrasound is facially surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope these are now at a price point of what used to be a hundred thousand euros or a couple hundred thousand dollars for about five thousand dollars I can have the power with very powerful diagnostic device in my hand and merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records in the United States we're still less than 20% electronic here in the Netherlands I think it's more than 80% but now that we're switching to merging medical data making it available electronically we can crowdsource that information and now as a physician I can access my patients data from wherever I am just through my mobile device and now of course we're in the era of the iPad even the iPad 2 and just last month the first fda-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices so certainly the physicians of the day including myself are completely reliable on these devices and as you saw just about a month ago Watson from IBM beat the two champions in jeopardy so I want you to imagine we're in a couple years we start to apply this cloud-based information well we really have the AI physician and leverage our own brains and connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done RT today you don't need to go to visit your physician in many cases only about 20% of actual visits you need to lay hands on the patient we're now in the era of virtual visits from sort of the Skype type visits you can do with American well to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system the ability to interact with your healthcare provider is different and these are on being augmented even by our devices again today here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room I can do some Diagnostics in that way or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology like the Microsoft Kinect and hack that to enable let's say Diagnostics for example in diagnosing stroke using simple motion detection using $100 devices we can actually now visit our patients robotically this is the rp7 if I'm a hematologist visit another clinic for visit a hospital these are being augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now so imagine we already have wireless scales you can step on the scale you can tweet your way to your friends and they can keep you in line we out wireless blood pressure cuffs a whole gamut of these technologies are being put together so instead of wearing these glue G devices we can put on a simple this is developed by colleagues at Stanford called the eye rhythm completely supplants the prior technology and a much lower price point with much more effective 'ti now we're also in the ear today of quantified self consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices like this little Fitbit I can measure my steps my caloric outtake I can get insight to that on a daily basis I can share that with my friends with my physician there's watches coming now that I'll measure your heart rate Zeo sleep monitors all suite of tools that can able get a leverage and have insight into your own health and if we start to integrate this information we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies health and wellness there's even mirrors today I can pick up your pulse rate and I would argue in the future we'll have wearable devices in our clothes modern in ourselves 24/7 and just like we have the OnStar system in cars your red light might go on and once a check engine light it's going to be check your body light and go in and get and take care of and probably in a few years we'll check in to your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you okay for those of you with with kiddos at home how would you like to have the the wireless diaper that sir supports here too much information I think that you might need but it's it's gonna be here now we've heard a lot today about technology and connection and I think actually some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of Medicine as augmented by these sorts of technologies now we talk about augmenting the patient to some degree how about augmenting the physician we're now near super labeling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery which is here today at a level that was not really possible even five years ago and now this has been automated further layers of technology like augmented reality so the surgeon can see inside the patient through their lens where the tumor is where the blood vessels are this can be integrated with decision support a surgeon in New York and be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam for example and we're entering era a really truly scarless surgery called notes where the endoscope robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all on a scarless wedding and robotically and this is called notes and this is coming basically scarless surgery is mediated by robotic surgery now how about controlling other elements for those who have disabilities the paraplegic there's the ear of brain computer interface or BCI where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a cursor or a wheelchair or initially a robotic arm and these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients still in clinical trials but imagine when we can connect these for example to the amazing bionic limb such as those of the DECA arm built by Dean Kaman and colleagues which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they've had in the past so we're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually if you haven't lost a limb you've had a stroke for example you can wear these augmented lambs or if you're a paraplegic like I visited the folks at Brooklyn bionics they've developed a legs I took this video last week here's a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons these otherwise complete world's you're bound and now this is the early era of wearable robotics and I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies we're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be super ability or super enabling this is Aimee Mullins who lost her lower limbs as a young child and Hugh her who is a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident and now both of these can climb better move faster swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal abled persons now how about other Exponential's consider the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction including with huge costs but the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller so a few examples we're now in the era of Fantastic Voyage the eye pill you can swallow this completely integrated device it can take pictures of your GI system help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract we need to even smaller micro robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons can't do in much less invasive manner sometimes it might have self-assemble in your GI system and be augmented that reality on the cardiac side pacemakers are getting small are much easier to place so you don't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them and they're going to be wirelessly to limit it again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely these are shrinking even further here's one that's in prototyping by Medtronic that's smaller than a penny artificial retinas the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see again in early trials but moving into the future these are going to be gained changing or for those of us who are sighted how about having the assisted living contact lens Bluetooth Wi-Fi available beams back images to your eye now if you have trouble maintaining your diet it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you how about enabling the pathologist to use their cellphone again to see at a microscopic level and tell ember that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics in fact the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing we can now leveraging micro fluidics like this chip made by Steve quake at Stanford micro fluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians and put it on a chip enable thousands of tests to be done at the point-of-care anywhere in the world and this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the underserved and unable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point-of-care if we go down the small pathway a little bit further we're learning the era of nano medicine the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or micro robots that will monitor our blood system or immune system or even those that might even clear out the class from our arteries now how about exponentially cheaper not something we usually think about in the era of medicine that hard just used to be $3,400 for 10 megabytes expletive cheaper in genomics now the genome cost about a billion dollars about ten years ago when the first one came out we're now approaching essentially a thousand dollar genome probably next year in two years about a hundred dollar genome what are we going to do with hundred dollar genomes and soon we'll have millions of these tests available and that's when it gets interesting when we start to crowdsource that information and we enter the era of true personalized medicine the right drug for the right person at the right time instead of what we're doing today which is essentially the same drug for everybody so two blockbuster drug medications many cases which don't work for you the individual and many many different companies are working on on leveraging these approaches and I'll just show you a simple example from 20 through me again my data indicates that I've got by average risk for developing macular degeneration two kind of blindness but if I take that same data upload it to decode me I can look at my risk for example type 2 diabetes I'm at almost twice the risk for type 2 diabetes I might want to watch how much dessert I have the lunch break for example it might change my behavior leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenetics how my genes modulate what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important and what's in the hands of the individual and the patient will make better drug dosing and selection available so again it's not just genes it's multiple details our habits our environmental exposures when was the last time your physician asked you where you've lived geo medicine where you live what you've been exposed to can dramatically affect your health we can capture that information so genomics proteomics the environment all this data streaming at us individually and as us as poor physicians how do we manage it well we're now entering the era of systems medicine or systems biology where we can start to integrate all this information and by looking at the patterns for example in our blood of 10,000 biomarkers at a single test we can start to look with these little patterns and detect disease in a much earlier stage and this is being called by Li hood the father of the fear of p4 medicine we're going to be predictive we're going to know what you're likely to have we can be preventive that prevention can be personalized and more importantly it's going to become increasingly participatory through websites like patients like me or managing your data on a Microsoft Health fault or a Google health leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important so I'll finish up with exponentially better we'd like to get therapies better and more effective now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills what if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that me delayed blood pressure and a single therapy basically cure hypertension this is a new device that essentially is doing that that should be on the market within a year or two how about more targeted therapies for cancer right I'm an oncologist and I know today most of what we give is essentially poison we've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover it cancer stem cells so once it seemed to be really responsible for disease relapse so if you think of cancer as a weed we often can whack the weed away it seems to shrink it often comes back so we're tacking the wrong target the cancer stem cells remain and the tumor can return months or years later we're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure and we're ending the era of personalized oncology the ability to leverage all this data together analyze the tumor and come up with a real specific cocktail for the individual patient now I'll close with regenerative medicine so I've studied a lot about stem cells embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful we also have adult stem cells throughout our body we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation Geron just

marrow it's now been FDA approved and will hopefully be on the market in the next year so hopefully you can appreciate the device that are curving through the patient's body and removing the bone marrow instead of with 200 punctures which is a single puncture under local anesthesia but where stem cell therapy really going if you think about it every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo we can have reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient making your own personalized stem cell lines and I think there'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to you know have in the freezer your own cardiac cells myocytes neural cells to use them in the future should you need them and we're integrating this now with a whole year of cellular engineering and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3d organ that's where things are going to head still very early days but I think as integration of exponential technologies this is the example so enclosed as you think about technology turns on how to impact health and medicine we're entering an era of miniaturization decentralization and personalization and I think by pulling these things together we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these we're going to empower the patient enable the doctor enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick because

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the generated MCQs, I found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about NOTES, which is a surgical technique that uses no external incision. Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is about a device that can knock out the nerve vessels that cause high blood pressure, but it's not directly related to NOTES.

However, I noticed that the speaker mentions NOTES in the transcript, and it's related to the topic of robotic surgery and scarless surgery. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of surgery and medical technology, I would suggest Question 9. However, please note that it's not a direct match, and the question intent and options are different from the ground truth MCQ.

really approaching in many cases surpassing the ability of the human mind but what I think computational speed is most applicable is that of imaging the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible we're layering multiple technologies PET scan CT scans and molecular diagnostics to find and seek things at different levels here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done to date reconstructed of Bartho - the curator of TEDMED and now we can see inside of the brain at a resolution and ability that was never before available and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even re-engineer or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand pathology disease and therapy we can look at side with real-time fMRI in the brain at real-time and by understanding these sorts of processes in these connections we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective for example psychoactive drugs the scanners for these are getting smaller and less expensive and more portable and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge the scan of today takes up about 800 books or 20 gigabytes the scan of just in a couple years will be one terabyte or 800,000 books how do we leverage the information let's get personal I won't ask you here's how to colonoscopy but if you're over age 50 it's time for your screening colonoscopy how would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick well now there's essentially virtual colonoscopy compare those two pictures and now as the radiologist you can Sochi fly through your patients calling and augmenting that with artificial intelligence identify potential as you see here a lesion that we might have missed it but using AI on top of radiology we can find lesions that were missed before and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise and this is an example this paradigm shift we're moving to this integration of biomedicine information technology wireless and I would say mobile now this era of digital medicine so even my stethoscope is now digital and of course there's an app for that we're moving obviously to the era of the tricorder so the handheld ultrasound is facially surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope these are now at a price point of what used to be a hundred thousand euros or a couple hundred thousand dollars for about five thousand dollars I can have the power with very powerful diagnostic device in my hand and merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records in the United States we're still less than 20% electronic here in the Netherlands I think it's more than 80% but now that we're switching to merging medical data making it available electronically we can crowdsource that information and now as a physician I can access my patients data from wherever I am just through my mobile device and now of course we're in the era of the iPad even the iPad 2 and just last month the first fda-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices so certainly the physicians of the day including myself are completely reliable on these devices and as you saw just about a month ago Watson from IBM beat the two champions in jeopardy so I want you to imagine we're in a couple years we start to apply this cloud-based information well we really have the AI physician and leverage our own brains and connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done RT today you don't need to go to visit your physician in many cases only about 20% of actual visits you need to lay hands on the patient we're now in the era of virtual visits from sort of the Skype type visits you can do with American well to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system the ability to interact with your healthcare provider is different and these are on being augmented even by our devices again today here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room I can do some Diagnostics in that way or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology like the Microsoft Kinect and hack that to enable let's say Diagnostics for example in diagnosing stroke using simple motion detection using $100 devices we can actually now visit our patients robotically this is the rp7 if I'm a hematologist visit another clinic for visit a hospital these are being augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now so imagine we already have wireless scales you can step on the scale you can tweet your way to your friends and they can keep you in line we out wireless blood pressure cuffs a whole gamut of these technologies are being put together so instead of wearing these glue G devices we can put on a simple this is developed by colleagues at Stanford called the eye rhythm completely supplants the prior technology and a much lower price point with much more effective 'ti now we're also in the ear today of quantified self consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices like this little Fitbit I can measure my steps my caloric outtake I can get insight to that on a daily basis I can share that with my friends with my physician there's watches coming now that I'll measure your heart rate Zeo sleep monitors all suite of tools that can able get a leverage and have insight into your own health and if we start to integrate this information we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies health and wellness there's even mirrors today I can pick up your pulse rate and I would argue in the future we'll have wearable devices in our clothes modern in ourselves 24/7 and just like we have the OnStar system in cars your red light might go on and once a check engine light it's going to be check your body light and go in and get and take care of and probably in a few years we'll check in to your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you okay for those of you with with kiddos at home how would you like to have the the wireless diaper that sir supports here too much information I think that you might need but it's it's gonna be here now we've heard a lot today about technology and connection and I think actually some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of Medicine as augmented by these sorts of technologies now we talk about augmenting the patient to some degree how about augmenting the physician we're now near super labeling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery which is here today at a level that was not really possible even five years ago and now this has been automated further layers of technology like augmented reality so the surgeon can see inside the patient through their lens where the tumor is where the blood vessels are this can be integrated with decision support a surgeon in New York and be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam for example and we're entering era a really truly scarless surgery called notes where the endoscope robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all on a scarless wedding and robotically and this is called notes and this is coming basically scarless surgery is mediated by robotic surgery now how about controlling other elements for those who have disabilities the paraplegic there's the ear of brain computer interface or BCI where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a cursor or a wheelchair or initially a robotic arm and these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients still in clinical trials but imagine when we can connect these for example to the amazing bionic limb such as those of the DECA arm built by Dean Kaman and colleagues which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they've had in the past so we're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually if you haven't lost a limb you've had a stroke for example you can wear these augmented lambs or if you're a paraplegic like I visited the folks at Brooklyn bionics they've developed a legs I took this video last week here's a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons these otherwise complete world's you're bound and now this is the early era of wearable robotics and I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies we're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be super ability or super enabling this is Aimee Mullins who lost her lower limbs as a young child and Hugh her who is a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident and now both of these can climb better move faster swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal abled persons now how about other Exponential's consider the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction including with huge costs but the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller so a few examples we're now in the era of Fantastic Voyage the eye pill you can swallow this completely integrated device it can take pictures of your GI system help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract we need to even smaller micro robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons can't do in much less invasive manner sometimes it might have self-assemble in your GI system and be augmented that reality on the cardiac side pacemakers are getting small are much easier to place so you don't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them and they're going to be wirelessly to limit it again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely these are shrinking even further here's one that's in prototyping by Medtronic that's smaller than a penny artificial retinas the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see again in early trials but moving into the future these are going to be gained changing or for those of us who are sighted how about having the assisted living contact lens Bluetooth Wi-Fi available beams back images to your eye now if you have trouble maintaining your diet it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you how about enabling the pathologist to use their cellphone again to see at a microscopic level and tell ember that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics in fact the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing we can now leveraging micro fluidics like this chip made by Steve quake at Stanford micro fluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians and put it on a chip enable thousands of tests to be done at the point-of-care anywhere in the world and this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the underserved and unable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point-of-care if we go down the small pathway a little bit further we're learning the era of nano medicine the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or micro robots that will monitor our blood system or immune system or even those that might even clear out the class from our arteries now how about exponentially cheaper not something we usually think about in the era of medicine that hard just used to be $3,400 for 10 megabytes expletive cheaper in genomics now the genome cost about a billion dollars about ten years ago when the first one came out we're now approaching essentially a thousand dollar genome probably next year in two years about a hundred dollar genome what are we going to do with hundred dollar genomes and soon we'll have millions of these tests available and that's when it gets interesting when we start to crowdsource that information and we enter the era of true personalized medicine the right drug for the right person at the right time instead of what we're doing today which is essentially the same drug for everybody so two blockbuster drug medications many cases which don't work for you the individual and many many different companies are working on on leveraging these approaches and I'll just show you a simple example from 20 through me again my data indicates that I've got by average risk for developing macular degeneration two kind of blindness but if I take that same data upload it to decode me I can look at my risk for example type 2 diabetes I'm at almost twice the risk for type 2 diabetes I might want to watch how much dessert I have the lunch break for example it might change my behavior leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenetics how my genes modulate what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important and what's in the hands of the individual and the patient will make better drug dosing and selection available so again it's not just genes it's multiple details our habits our environmental exposures when was the last time your physician asked you where you've lived geo medicine where you live what you've been exposed to can dramatically affect your health we can capture that information so genomics proteomics the environment all this data streaming at us individually and as us as poor physicians how do we manage it well we're now entering the era of systems medicine or systems biology where we can start to integrate all this information and by looking at the patterns for example in our blood of 10,000 biomarkers at a single test we can start to look with these little patterns and detect disease in a much earlier stage and this is being called by Li hood the father of the fear of p4 medicine we're going to be predictive we're going to know what you're likely to have we can be preventive that prevention can be personalized and more importantly it's going to become increasingly participatory through websites like patients like me or managing your data on a Microsoft Health fault or a Google health leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important so I'll finish up with exponentially better we'd like to get therapies better and more effective now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills what if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that me delayed blood pressure and a single therapy basically cure hypertension this is a new device that essentially is doing that that should be on the market within a year or two how about more targeted therapies for cancer right I'm an oncologist and I know today most of what we give is essentially poison we've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover it cancer stem cells so once it seemed to be really responsible for disease relapse so if you think of cancer as a weed we often can whack the weed away it seems to shrink it often comes back so we're tacking the wrong target the cancer stem cells remain and the tumor can return months or years later we're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure and we're ending the era of personalized oncology the ability to leverage all this data together analyze the tumor and come up with a real specific cocktail for the individual patient now I'll close with regenerative medicine so I've studied a lot about stem cells embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful we also have adult stem cells throughout our body we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation Geron just last year start of the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries still a phase one trial but evolving we've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics particularly in treating cardiovascular disease if we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack I invented a bicycle the marrow miner a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow it's now been FDA approved and will hopefully be on the market in the next year so hopefully you can appreciate the device that are curving through the patient's body and removing the bone marrow instead of with 200 punctures which is a single puncture under local anesthesia but where stem cell therapy really going if you think about it every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo we can have reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient making your own personalized stem cell lines and I think there'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to you know have in the freezer your own cardiac cells myocytes neural cells to use them in the future should you need them and we're integrating this now with a whole year of cellular engineering and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3d organ that's where things are going to head still very early days but I think as integration of exponential technologies this is the example so enclosed as you think about technology turns on how to impact health and medicine we're entering an era of miniaturization decentralization and personalization and I think by pulling these things together we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these we're going to empower the patient enable the doctor enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick because I know as a doctor if someone comes to me with stage one disease I'm thrilled we can often cure them but often is too late and it's stage three or four cancer for example so by leveraging these technologies together I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call stage zero medicine and as a cancer doctor I'm looking forward to being out of a job thanks very much

**Transcript**:
a couple of years ago when I was attending the TED conference in Long Beach I met Harriet now we'd actually met online before you know not the way you're thinking we were actually introduced because we both knew Linda av one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies and because we shared our genetic information with Linda she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA haplotype K 1 a 1 B 1 a which meant that we were distantly related we actually shared the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman so Ozzie Harriet and me and being the current day of course we start our own Facebook group you're all welcome to join and when I met Harriet and person the next year at the TED conference she'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype t-shirts now why am I telling you this story what does this have to do with the future of health well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bioinformatics to the connection of the internet and social networking what I like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies you know we often think linearly but if you think about it if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day 2 4 8 16 15 days of 32,000 what do you think you have in a month or at a billion so if we start to think exponentially we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us and many of these technologies speaking as a physician and innovator we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of healthcare and to address many of the major challenges that we have in healthcare today ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population the way we really don't use information very well today the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation and one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left we spend most of our money on the last 20% of life what if we get spend and incentivize physicians and healthcare system in our own self to move the curve to left improve our health leveraging technology as well now my favorite technology example of exponential technology we all have in our pocket so if you just think about it these are really dramatically improving I mean this is the iPhone 4 imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do now I've gained some insight into this I've been the track chair for the medicine portion of a new institution called singularity University based in Silicon Valley and we bring together each summer about 100 very talented students from around the world and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine biotech artificial intelligence robotics nanotechnology space and address how could cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals we also have seven-day executive programs and coming up next month is actually future mat a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine now I mentioned the phone these mobile phones have over I think 20,000 different mobile apps available to the point where there's one out of the UK where you can pee in a little chip connect it to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD and I try that yet but that's available there other sorts of applications merging your phone and diagnostics for example measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that Prudential e to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic so let's see now how exponential technologies are taking healthcare let's start with faster well it's no secret that computers through Moore's law are speeding up faster and faster we have the ability to do more powerful things with them they're really approaching in many cases surpassing the ability of the human mind but what I think computational speed is most applicable is that of imaging the ability now to look inside the body in real

available and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even re-engineer or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand pathology disease and therapy we can look at side with real-time fMRI in the brain at real-time and by understanding these sorts of processes in these connections we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective for example psychoactive drugs the scanners for these are getting smaller and less expensive and more portable and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge the scan of today takes up about 800 books or 20 gigabytes the scan of just in a couple years will be one terabyte or 800,000 books how do we leverage the information let's get

if we go down the small pathway a little bit further we're learning the era of nano medicine the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or micro robots that will monitor our blood system or immune system or even those that might even clear out the class from our arteries now how about exponentially cheaper not something we usually think about in the era of medicine that hard just used to be $3,400 for 10 megabytes expletive cheaper in genomics now the genome cost about a billion dollars about ten years ago when the first one came out we're now approaching essentially a thousand dollar genome probably next year in two years about a hundred dollar genome what are we going to do with hundred dollar genomes and soon we'll have millions of these tests available and that's when it gets interesting when we start to crowdsource that information and we enter the era of true personalized medicine the right drug for the right person at the right time instead of what we're doing today which is essentially the same drug for everybody so two blockbuster drug medications many cases which don't work for you the individual and many many different companies are working on on leveraging these approaches and I'll just show you a simple example from 20 through me again my data indicates that I've got by average risk for developing macular degeneration two kind of blindness but if I take that same data upload it to decode me I can look at my risk for example type 2 diabetes I'm at almost twice the risk for type 2 diabetes I might want to watch how much dessert I have the lunch break for example it might change my behavior leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenetics how my genes modulate what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important and what's in the hands of the individual and the patient will make better drug dosing and selection available so again it's not just genes it's multiple details our habits our environmental exposures when was the last time your physician asked you where you've lived geo medicine where you live what you've been exposed to can dramatically affect your health we can capture that information so genomics proteomics the environment all this data streaming at us individually and as us as poor physicians how do we manage it well we're now entering the era of systems medicine or systems biology where we can start to integrate all this information and by looking at the patterns for example in our blood of 10,000 biomarkers at a single test we can start to look with these little patterns and detect disease in a much earlier stage and this is being called by Li hood the father of the fear of p4 medicine we're going to be predictive we're going to know what you're likely to have we can be preventive that prevention can be personalized and more importantly it's going to become increasingly participatory through websites like patients like me or managing your data on a Microsoft Health fault or a Google health leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important so I'll finish up with exponentially better we'd like to get therapies better and more effective now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills what if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that me delayed blood pressure and a single therapy basically cure hypertension this is a new device that essentially is doing that that should be on the market within a year or two how about more targeted therapies for cancer right I'm an oncologist and I know today most of what we give is essentially poison we've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover it cancer stem cells so once it seemed to be really responsible for disease relapse so if you think of cancer as a weed we often can whack the weed away it seems to shrink it often comes back so we're tacking the wrong target the cancer stem cells remain and the tumor can return months or years later we're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure and we're ending the era of personalized oncology the ability to leverage all this data together analyze the tumor and come up with a real specific cocktail for the individual patient now I'll close with regenerative medicine so I've studied a lot about stem cells embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful we also have adult stem cells throughout our body we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation Geron just last year start of the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries still a phase one trial but evolving we've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics particularly in treating cardiovascular disease if we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack I invented a bicycle the marrow miner a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow it's now been FDA approved and will hopefully be on the market in the next year so hopefully you can appreciate the device that are curving through the patient's body and removing the bone marrow instead of with 200 punctures which is a single puncture under local anesthesia but where stem cell therapy really going if you think about it every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo we can have reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient making your own personalized stem cell lines and I think there'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to you know have in the freezer your own cardiac cells myocytes neural cells to use them in the future should you need them and we're integrating this now with a whole year of cellular engineering and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3d organ that's where things are going to head still very early days but I think as integration of exponential technologies this is the example so enclosed as you think about technology turns on how to impact health and medicine we're entering an era of miniaturization decentralization and personalization and I think by pulling these things together we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these we're going to empower the patient enable the doctor enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick because I know as a doctor if someone comes to me with stage one disease I'm thrilled we can often cure them but often is too late and it's stage three or four cancer for example so by leveraging these technologies together I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call stage zero medicine and as a cancer doctor I'm looking forward to being out of a job thanks very much

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] in the past several days I heard people talking about China and also I talked to friends about China and Chinese internet something is very challenging to me I want to make my friends still understand China is complicated so I always want to tell the story like one hand it is there the other hand is that you can't just tell one side story I give you example China is a brick Country Brick country means Brazil Russia India and China this emerging economy really is helping Revival of the world economy but at the same time on the other hand China is a sick country the the terminology calleded by Facebook IPO paper five he said the sick country means Syria Iran China and North Korea the four countries have no access to Facebook so basically China is a sick break country another project was build to watch China and Chinese internet but now now today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past sever years from that war so if you are a fan of the game of thron you definitely know how important a big war for Old Kingdom it prevent weird things from the north same was true for China in the north there was a great War Junction it protect China from Invaders for 2,000 years but China also have a great fire War that's the biggest Digital Boundary in the whole world it's not only to defend Chinese regime from the overc from the universal value but also prevent Chinese own citizen to access the global free internet and even separate themselves into blocks not United so basically internet has two internets one is the internet the other is the China net but if you think the China net is something like a dead land Roost land I think is wrong but we also use very simple metaphor the cat and the mouse game to describe in the past 15 years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship government censorship the cat and the Chinese internet users that mean us the mouse but sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple so today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version in China we have 500 million internet users that's biggest population of natien Internet users in the whole world so if even Chinese is a totally censored internet but still Chinese internet Society is really booming how make it it's simple you have Google we have Buu you have Twitter we have weo you have Facebook we have renen you have YouTube we have yuku and Twitter Chinese government blocked every single International Web Two P services and we Chinese copycat everyone so that's kind of the thing I called SM censorship so that's not only to censor you sometimes that's Chinese National internet policy is very simple block and clone on the one hand he want to satisfy people's need of social network which is very important people really love social networking but on the other hand they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data anytime they want that's also the reason Google was pulled out from China because they can't accept the fact Chinese government want to keep the server sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands for example Mubarak he shut down the internet he want to prevent neens to criticize him but once Nan can't go online they go on street and now the result is very simple we all know Mubarak is technically dead but also Ben Ani Tunisia president didn't follow the second rule that means keep the server in your hand he allowed Facebook a us-based services service to continue stay on inside Tunisia so he can't prevented his own citizens to post critical video against his corruption the same thing happened he was the first to tobert joing the Arab spray but those two very smart you know National censorship policy didn't prevent Chinese social media become a really public spere a b feere of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials because we have 300 million micro bloggers in China is the entire population of United States so when these 300 million people Michel blogger even they block the tweet in a censored platform but itself is China L but it can create very powerful energy which is never happened in the Chinese history 2011 the July two briding trains crashed in wo a sou city right after the train crash authorities literally want to cover up the train bury the train so it's anger the Chinese Naes the first five days after the train crash there were 10 million critism of the posting on the social media which never happened in Chinese history and later later this year the real Minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years and also very recently very funny debate between the Beijing environment Ministry and American Embassy in Beijing because the ministry blame American Embassy for intervening Chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of Beijing so the app is the embassy data the PM 2.5 he show 148 they show is dangerous for sensitive group so suggestion is not good to go outside but the D is the Ministries data he shows 50 he said it's good it's good to go outside but 99% of Chinese micro bloggers stand firmly on the embassy side I live in Beijing every day I just watch the American Embassy data to decide whether I should open my window why Chinese social networking even within the censorship is so boming part of the reason is Chinese languages you know ttor and trt clones have a kind of a limitation 14 characters but in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link maybe in Germany a German language maybe just AA but in Chinese language is really about 140 characters means a paragraph a story you can almost have all the journalistic elements to there for example this is the Hamlet of the Shakespeare the same content one you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets Chinese is always cheating right so because of this Chinese really regard this micro blogging as a media not only headline to media and also the Clone Signal Company is the guy who cloned the Twitter they even has their own name with with weo weo is Chinese translation for mic blog it has owned the Innovation at the commenting area make the Chinese weor more like Facebook rather than original Twitter so these Innovations and clones as the wo and micro blogging when they come to China in 2009 the immediately become the media platform itself it become a media platform of 300 million readers it become the media if anything not mentioned in weo it does not appear to exist for Chinese public but also Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindset and Chinese life for example they give the voiceless people a China to make your voice heard we had a petition system is a remedy outside the judicial system because Chinese central government want to keep a miss the emperor is good but all the local officials are sucks so that's why the petitioner the victims of the pant went to take the train to Beijing to petition to central government want the emperor want to settle the problem but when more and more people go to Beijing they also cause the risk of Revolution so they sent them back recent years and even some of of them would put into black jaar but now we have the weo so I called weo petition people just use the cell phone to tweet so your sad stories by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters professors or celebrities one of that is yaan she's most popular micro blogger in China who has about 21 million followers they're almost like a national TV station if you st sad story will pick up by her so this wo social media even in the censorship still gave Chinese a real chance for 300 million people every day chatting together talking to together it's like a big Tad right but also it is like the first time of public sphere happened in China Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people but also the cat the sensorship is not sleeping it's so hard to post some sensitive words in the Chinese we for for example you can't post the name of the president huin and also you can't post the city of chonging name and until recently you can't search the surname of top top leaders so the Chinese are very good that there palms and alternative wording and even memes the even Nam you know use the name of this world changing batter between the grma horse and River craft grma horse is T it's the photogram for  it's n call River crap is is the phonogram for harmonization for sensorship so that's kind of Aima versus the her that's very good but so that's in when some very political exciting moment happened you can see on the way you still a lot of very weird stories happened weird phrases and words even you have a PhD of Chinese language you can't understand them but you can you expect more no because Chinese signal weor one he was funded is exactly one month after the official blocking of twitter.com that means from the very beginning the weor already has already convinced the Chinese government we will not be become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime for example anything you want to post like get together or meet up or work it will automatically will recorded and data mined and reported to a pool for further an political analysing even you want to have some gathering before you go there the place is already waiting for you why because they have the data they have everything in their hand so so they you can they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the disident so the Crackdown is very serious but I want you notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse the cat is the censorship but Chinese is not only one cat but I also have local cats Central cat and local cats you know server is in the local cat's hands so it let when the Nan criticize local government local government has no any access of the data in Beijing without bribing the central cast he can do nothing only apologize so this three year in the past three years social movement about micro blogging really changed local government they can more become more and more transparent because they can't access the data the server is in Beijing the story about TR crash maybe the question is not about why 10 million criticism in 5 days but why Chinese central government allow the five days of freedom of speech online it never happened before answer is very simple because even the top leaders was fed up with this guy this independent Kingdom so they want excuse so public opinion is very good excuse to punish him but also the Bosa case recently very big news he's princeling but in from the febrary to the April in this year W really become a Marketplace of rumors you can almost joke everything about this princelings everything it's almost you are living in the United States but if you dare to retreat or mention any fake coup about Beijing in Beijing you definitely will be arrested so this kind of freedom is targeted and precise window so Chinese in China censorship is normal something you find is freedom is weird something will happen behind because he was very popular leftist leader so central government want to purge him they need very cute to convince the all the Chinese people why he's so bad so the the wayo 300 million public sphere become very good convenient tour for political fight but this technology is very new but technique is very old it made Famous by chairman ma maon because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the cultural revolution to destroy every local government it's very simple because Chinese central government don't need even lead the public opinion they just give them a Target window no censor people not censoring in China become a political toour so that's the update about this game cat and the mouse social media change Chinese mindset more and more chinesee intend to embrace freedom speech and human rights as their Birthright not some important American privilege but also it gave Chinese a national public Sphere for people to it's like a training of their citizenship preparing for the future democracy but it didn't change Chinese political system and also Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen his power to control the local government and the different factions so what's the future but after all we are the mouse whatever the future is we should fight against the mouse there is not only in China but also in the United States there are know some very small cute but bad cats so P ecta TPP and itu you and also like Facebook and the Google they claim they are friends of the mouse but sometimes we see them dating with the cats so my conclusion is very simple we Chinese fight our for our freedom you just watch your bad cats don't let them to hook with the Chinese cats only in this in the future we will achieve achieve the dreams of the mouse that we can can treat anytime anywhere without fear thank you

you can see on the way you still a lot of very weird stories happened weird phrases and words even you have a PhD of Chinese language you can't understand them but you can you expect more no because Chinese signal weor one he was funded is exactly one month after the official blocking of twitter.com that means from the very beginning the weor already has already convinced the Chinese government we will not be become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime for example anything you want to post like get together or meet up or work it will automatically will recorded and data mined and reported to a pool for further an political analysing even you want to have some gathering before you go there the place is already waiting for you why because they have the data they have everything in their hand so so they you can they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the disident so the Crackdown is very serious but I want you notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse the cat is the censorship but Chinese is not only one cat but I also have local cats Central cat and local cats you know server is in the local cat's hands so it let when the Nan criticize local government local government has no any access of the data in Beijing without bribing the central cast he can do nothing only apologize so this three year in the past three years social movement about micro blogging really changed local government they can more become more and more transparent because they can't access the data the server is in Beijing the story about TR crash maybe the question is not about why 10 million criticism in 5 days but why Chinese central government allow the five days of freedom of speech online it never happened before answer is very simple because even the top leaders was fed up with this guy this independent Kingdom so they want excuse so public opinion is very good excuse to punish him but also the Bosa case recently very big news he's princeling but in from the febrary to the April in this year W really become a Marketplace of rumors you can almost joke everything about this princelings everything it's almost you are living in the United States but if you dare to retreat or mention any fake coup about Beijing in Beijing you definitely will be arrested so this kind of freedom is targeted and precise window so Chinese in China censorship is normal something you find is freedom is weird something will happen behind because he was very popular leftist leader so central government want to purge him they need very cute to convince the all the Chinese people why he's so bad so the the wayo 300 million public sphere become very good convenient tour for political fight but this technology is very new but technique is very old it made Famous by chairman ma maon because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the cultural revolution to destroy every local government it's very simple because Chinese central government don't need even lead the public opinion they just give them a Target window no censor people not censoring in China become a political toour so that's the update about this game cat and the mouse social media change Chinese mindset more and more chinesee intend to embrace freedom speech and human rights as their Birthright not some important American privilege but also it gave Chinese a national public Sphere for people to it's like a training of their citizenship preparing for the future democracy but it didn't change Chinese political system and also Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen his power to control the local government and the different factions so what's the future but after all we are the mouse whatever the future is we should fight against the mouse there is not only in China but also in the United States there are know some very small cute but bad cats so P ecta TPP and itu you and also like Facebook and the Google they claim they are friends of the mouse but sometimes we see them dating with the cats so my conclusion is very simple we Chinese fight our for our freedom you just watch your bad cats don't let them to hook with the Chinese cats only in this in the future we will achieve achieve the dreams of the mouse that we can can treat anytime anywhere without fear thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] in the past several days I heard people talking about China and also I talked to friends about China and Chinese internet something is very challenging to me I want to make my friends still understand China is complicated so I always want to tell the story like one hand it is there the other hand is that you can't just tell one side story I give you example China is a brick Country Brick country means Brazil Russia India and China this emerging economy really is helping Revival of the world economy but at the same time on the other hand China is a sick country the the terminology calleded by Facebook IPO paper five he said the sick country means Syria Iran China and North Korea the four countries have no access to Facebook so basically China is a sick break country another project was build to watch China and Chinese internet but now now today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past sever years from that war so if you are a fan of the game of thron you definitely know how important a big war for Old Kingdom it prevent weird things from the north same was true for China in the north there was a great War Junction it protect China from Invaders for 2,000 years but China also have a great fire War that's the biggest Digital Boundary in the whole world it's not only to defend Chinese regime from the overc from the universal value but also prevent Chinese own citizen to access the global free internet and even separate themselves into blocks not United so basically internet has two internets one is the internet the other is the China net but if you think the China net is something like a dead land Roost land I think is wrong but we also use very simple metaphor the cat and the mouse game to describe in the past 15 years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship government censorship the cat and the Chinese internet users that mean us the mouse but sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple so today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version in China we have 500 million internet users that's biggest population of natien Internet users in the whole world so if even Chinese is a totally censored internet but still Chinese internet Society is really booming how make it it's simple you have Google we have Buu you have Twitter we have weo you have Facebook we have renen you have YouTube we have yuku and Twitter Chinese government blocked every single International Web Two P services and we Chinese copycat everyone so that's kind of the thing I called SM censorship so that's not only to censor you sometimes that's Chinese National internet policy is very simple block and clone on the one hand he want to satisfy people's need of social network which is very important people really love social networking but on the other hand they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data anytime they want that's also the reason Google was pulled out from China because they can't accept the fact Chinese government want to keep the server sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands for example Mubarak he shut down the internet he want to prevent neens to criticize him but once Nan can't go online they go on street and now the result is very simple we all know Mubarak is technically dead but also Ben Ani Tunisia president didn't follow the second rule that means keep the server in your hand he allowed Facebook a us-based services service to continue stay on inside Tunisia so he can't prevented his own citizens to post critical video against his corruption the same thing happened he was the first to tobert joing the Arab spray but those two very smart you know National censorship policy didn't prevent Chinese social media become a really public spere a b feere of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials because we have 300 million micro bloggers in China is the entire population of United States so when these 300 million people Michel blogger even they block the tweet in a censored platform but itself is China L but it can create very powerful energy which is never happened in the Chinese history 2011 the July two briding trains crashed in wo a sou city right after the train crash authorities literally want to cover up the train bury the train so it's anger the Chinese Naes the first five days after the train crash there were 10 million critism of the posting on the social media which never happened in Chinese history and later later this year the real Minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years and also very recently very funny debate between the Beijing environment Ministry and American Embassy in Beijing because the ministry blame American Embassy for intervening Chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of Beijing so the app is the embassy data the PM 2.5 he show 148 they show is dangerous for sensitive group so suggestion is not good to go outside but the D is the Ministries data he shows 50 he said it's good it's good to go outside but 99% of Chinese micro bloggers stand firmly on the embassy side I live in Beijing every day I just watch the American Embassy data to decide whether I should open my window why Chinese social networking even within the censorship is so boming part of the reason is Chinese languages you know ttor and trt clones have a kind of a limitation 14 characters but in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link maybe in Germany a German language maybe just AA but in Chinese language is really about 140 characters means a paragraph a story you can almost have all the journalistic elements to there for example this is the Hamlet of the Shakespeare the same content one you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets Chinese is always cheating right so because of this Chinese really regard this micro blogging as a media not only headline to media and also the Clone Signal Company is the guy who cloned the Twitter they even has their own name with with weo weo is Chinese translation for mic blog it has owned the Innovation at the commenting area make the Chinese weor more like Facebook rather than original Twitter so these Innovations and clones as the wo and micro blogging when they come to China in 2009 the immediately become the media platform itself it become a media platform of 300 million readers it become the media if anything not mentioned in weo it does not appear to exist for Chinese public but also Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindset and Chinese life for example they give the voiceless people a China to make your voice heard we had a petition system is a remedy outside the judicial system because Chinese central government want to keep a miss the emperor is good but all the local officials are sucks so that's why the petitioner the victims of the pant went to take the train to Beijing to petition to central government want the emperor want to settle the problem but when more and more people go to Beijing they also cause the risk of Revolution so they sent them back recent years and even some of of them would put into black jaar but now we have the weo so I called weo petition people just use the cell phone to tweet so your sad stories by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters professors or celebrities one of that is yaan she's most popular micro blogger in China who has about 21 million followers they're almost like a national TV station if you st sad story will pick up by her so this wo social media even in the censorship still gave Chinese a real chance for 300 million people every day chatting together talking to together it's like a big Tad right but also it is like the first time of public sphere happened in China Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people but also the cat the sensorship is not sleeping it's so hard to post some sensitive words in the Chinese we for for example you can't post the name of the president huin and also you can't post the city of chonging name and until recently you can't search the surname of top top leaders so the Chinese are very good that there palms and alternative wording and even memes the even Nam you know use the name of this world changing batter between the grma horse and River craft grma horse is T it's the photogram for  it's n call River crap is is the phonogram for harmonization for sensorship so that's kind of Aima versus the her that's very good but so that's in when some very political exciting moment happened you can see on the way you still a lot of very weird stories happened weird phrases and words even you have a PhD of Chinese language you can't understand them but you can you expect more no because Chinese signal weor one he was funded is exactly one month after the official blocking of twitter.com that means from the very beginning the weor already has already convinced the Chinese government we will not be become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime for example anything you want to post like get together or meet up or work it will automatically will recorded and data mined and reported to a pool for further an political analysing even you want to have some gathering before you go there the place is already waiting for you why because they have the data they have everything in their hand so so they you can they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the disident so the Crackdown is very serious but I want you notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse the cat is the censorship but Chinese is not only one cat but I also have local cats Central cat and local cats you know server is in the local cat's hands so it let when the Nan criticize local government local government has no any access of the data in Beijing without bribing the central cast he can do nothing only apologize so this three year in the past three years social movement about micro blogging really changed local government they can more become more and more transparent because they can't access the data the server is in Beijing the story about TR crash maybe the question is not about why 10 million criticism in 5 days but why Chinese central government allow the five days of freedom of speech online it never happened before answer is very simple because even the top leaders was fed up with this guy this independent Kingdom so they want excuse so public opinion is very good excuse to punish him but also the Bosa case recently very big news he's princeling but in from the febrary to the April in this year W really become a Marketplace of rumors you can almost joke everything about this princelings everything it's almost you are living in the United States but if you dare to retreat or mention any fake coup about Beijing in Beijing you definitely will be arrested so this kind of freedom is targeted and precise window so Chinese in China censorship is normal something you find is freedom is weird something will happen behind because he was very popular leftist leader so central government want to purge him they need very cute to convince the all the Chinese people why he's so bad so the the wayo 300 million public sphere become very good convenient tour for political fight but this technology is very new but technique is very old it made Famous by chairman ma maon because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the cultural revolution to destroy every local government it's very simple because Chinese central government don't need even lead the public opinion they just give them a Target window no censor people not censoring in China become a political toour so that's the update about this game cat and the mouse social media change Chinese mindset more and more chinesee intend to embrace freedom speech and human rights as their Birthright not some important American privilege but also it gave Chinese a national public Sphere for people to it's like a training of their citizenship preparing for the future democracy but it didn't change Chinese political system and also Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen his power to control the local government and the different factions so what's the future but after all we are the mouse whatever the future is we should fight against the mouse there is not only in China but also in the United States there are know some very small cute but bad cats so P ecta TPP and itu you and also like Facebook and the Google they claim they are friends of the mouse but sometimes we see them dating with the cats so my conclusion is very simple we Chinese fight our for our freedom you just watch your bad cats don't let them to hook with the Chinese cats only in this in the future we will achieve achieve the dreams of the mouse that we can can treat anytime anywhere without fear thank you

[Music] [Music] [Applause] in the past several days I heard people talking about China and also I talked to friends about China and Chinese internet something is very challenging to me I want to make my friends still understand China is complicated so I always want to tell the story like one hand it is there the other hand is that you can't just tell one side story I give you example China is a brick Country Brick country means Brazil Russia India and China this emerging economy really is helping Revival of the world economy but at the same time on the other hand China is a sick country the the terminology calleded by Facebook IPO paper five he said the sick country means Syria Iran China and North Korea the four countries have no access to Facebook so basically China is a sick break country another project was build to watch China and Chinese internet but now now today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past sever years from that war so if you are a fan of the game of thron you definitely know how important a big war for Old Kingdom it prevent weird things from the north same was true for China in the north there was a great War Junction it protect China from Invaders for 2,000 years but China also have a great fire War that's the biggest Digital Boundary in the whole world it's not only to defend Chinese regime from the overc from the universal value but also prevent Chinese own citizen to access the global free internet and even separate themselves into blocks not United so basically internet has two internets one is the internet the other is the China net but if you think the China net is something like a dead land Roost land I think is wrong but we also use very simple metaphor the cat and the mouse game to describe in the past 15 years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship government censorship the cat and the Chinese internet users that mean us the mouse but sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple so today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version in China we have 500 million internet users that's biggest population of natien Internet users in the whole world so if even Chinese is a totally censored internet but still Chinese internet Society is really booming how make it it's simple you have Google we have Buu you have Twitter we have weo you have Facebook we have renen you have YouTube we have yuku and Twitter Chinese government blocked every single International Web Two P services and we Chinese copycat everyone so that's kind of the thing I called SM censorship so that's not only to censor you sometimes that's Chinese National internet policy is very simple block and clone on the one hand he want to satisfy people's need of social network which is very important people really love social networking but on the other hand they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data anytime they want that's also the reason Google was pulled out from China because they can't accept the fact Chinese government want to keep the server sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands for example Mubarak he shut down the internet he want to prevent neens to criticize him but once Nan can't go online they go on street and now the result is very simple we all know Mubarak is technically dead but also Ben Ani Tunisia president didn't follow the second rule that means keep the server in your hand he allowed Facebook a us-based services service to continue stay on inside Tunisia so he can't prevented his own citizens to post critical video against his corruption the same thing happened he was the first to tobert joing the Arab spray but those two very smart you know National censorship policy didn't prevent Chinese social media become a really public spere a b feere

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about how bloggers post about sensitive information without using censored words. The correct answer is that bloggers use puns and alternative wording to reference censored words.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is about the "cat and mouse game" referring to China's internet censorship, which is related to the topic of censorship and sensitive information. However, it does not directly address the question of how bloggers post about sensitive information.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

readers it become the media if anything not mentioned in weo it does not appear to exist for Chinese public but also Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindset and Chinese life for example they give the voiceless people a China to make your voice heard we had a petition system is a remedy outside the judicial system because Chinese central government want to keep a miss the emperor is good but all the local officials are sucks so that's why the petitioner the victims of the pant went to take the train to Beijing to petition to central government want the emperor want to settle the problem but when more and more people go to Beijing they also cause the risk of Revolution so they sent them back recent years and even some of of them would put into black jaar but now we have the weo so I called weo petition people just use the cell phone to tweet so your sad stories by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters professors or celebrities one of that is yaan she's most popular micro blogger in China who has about 21 million followers they're almost like a national TV station if you st sad story will pick up by her so this wo social media even in the censorship still gave Chinese a real chance for 300 million people every day chatting together talking to together it's like a big Tad right but also it is like the first time of public sphere happened in China Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people but also the cat the sensorship is not sleeping it's so hard to post some sensitive words in the Chinese we for for example you can't post the name of the president huin and also you can't post the city of chonging name and until recently you can't search the surname of top top leaders so the Chinese are very good that there palms and alternative wording and even memes the even Nam you know use the name of this world changing batter between the grma horse and River craft grma horse is T it's the photogram for  it's n call River crap is is the phonogram for harmonization for sensorship so that's kind of Aima versus the her that's very good but so that's in when some very political exciting moment happened you can see on the way you still a lot of very weird stories happened weird phrases and words even you have a PhD of Chinese language you can't understand them but you can you expect more no because Chinese signal weor one he was funded is exactly one month after the official blocking of twitter.com that means from the very beginning the weor already has already convinced the Chinese government we will not be become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime for example anything you want to post like get together or meet up or work it will automatically will recorded and data mined and reported to a pool for further an political analysing even you want to have some gathering before you go there the place is already waiting for you why because they have the data they have everything in their hand so so they you can they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the disident so the Crackdown is very serious but I want you notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse the cat is the censorship but Chinese is not only one cat but I also have local cats Central cat and local cats you know server is in the local cat's hands so it let when the Nan criticize local government local government has no any access of the data in Beijing without bribing the central cast he can do nothing only apologize so this three year in the past three years social movement about micro blogging really changed local government they can more become more and more transparent because they can't access the data the server is in Beijing the story about TR crash maybe the question is not about why 10 million criticism in 5 days but why Chinese central government allow the five days of freedom of speech online it never happened before answer is very simple because even the top leaders was fed up with this guy this independent Kingdom so they want excuse so public opinion is very good excuse to punish him but also the Bosa case recently very big news he's princeling but in from the febrary to the April in this year W really become a Marketplace of rumors you can almost joke everything about this princelings everything it's almost you are living in the United States but if you dare to retreat or mention any fake coup about Beijing in Beijing you definitely will be arrested so this kind of freedom is targeted and precise window so Chinese in China censorship is normal something you find is freedom is weird something will happen behind because he was very popular leftist leader so central government want to purge him they need very cute to convince the all the Chinese people why he's so bad so the the wayo 300 million public sphere become very good convenient tour for political fight but this technology is very new but technique is very old it made Famous by chairman ma maon because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the cultural revolution to destroy every local government it's very simple because Chinese central government don't need even lead the public opinion they just give them a Target window no censor people not censoring in China become a political toour so that's the update about this game cat and the mouse social media change Chinese mindset more and more chinesee intend to embrace freedom speech and human rights as their Birthright not some important American privilege but also it gave Chinese a national public Sphere for people to it's like a training of their citizenship preparing for the future democracy but it didn't change Chinese political system and also Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen his power to control the local government and the different factions so what's the future but after all we are the mouse whatever the future is we should fight against the mouse there is not only in China but also in the United States there are know some very small cute but bad cats so P ecta TPP and itu you and also like Facebook and the Google they claim they are friends of the mouse but sometimes we see them dating with the cats so my conclusion is very simple we Chinese fight our for our freedom you just watch your bad cats don't let them to hook with the Chinese cats only in this in the future we will achieve achieve the dreams of the mouse that we can can treat anytime anywhere without fear thank you

Mysteries of vernacular: Gorgeous, beautiful or very attractive. The source of the word gorgeous can be found in the Latin word, gurges, used by the Romans to describe a whirling, swirling whirlpool. Thanks to the aquatic phenomenon's cylindrical shape and gurgling form, gurges also came to mean throat. By the time gurges reached England in the 14th century, it had been altered to gorge. This, to the English, seemed like an appropriate way to describe a steep and rocky ravine, a metaphorical extension of the words referenced to the throat. The French, however, transformed gorge into gorgias and used it to describe one of the most fashionable trends of the Middle Ages, also known as a wimple. This popular article of clothing revealed only the madame's visage, covering her shoulders, head, and, of course, her throat . A stylish and intricate gorgias was so telling of class and affluence that the word soon came to mean fond of dress and elegant. This newly fashioned adjective voyaged into Middle English as gorgayse, where it was fully anglicized as gorgeous. Since then, it has been linked to all things of exceptionally graceful allure.

**Transcript**:
Would you believe that walruses, rattlesnakes, and parakeets all once lived in the same house? Let's go back about 350 million years. Look around. Steamy swamps and rain forests
of horsetails and ferns cover the region. Amphibians are the dominant
land vertebrates. They range in size from newts to crocodiles. And all require water
to do their egg laying. If they don't go to the water, their shell-less, jelly-like
eggs will dry out. Because of this hazard, they spend most of their time living in or near fresh water. That is, until a breakthrough in evolution changes everything: the amniotic egg. The amniotic egg is shelled, waterproof, and can be laid on dry land. It is produced by the amniotes, a new group of animals named
after their revolutionary egg. The first amniote is a tetrapod, a four-legged animal, resembling a small lizard. While some amphibians
can walk around on land and bury their eggs in wet
soil or highly humid areas, nothing before the amniotes
has the ability to lay its eggs on completely dry land. Because of this evolved egg, the amniotes are the first animals with the ability to live
a fully terrestrial life. But, despite their move inland, the amniotes have not abandoned their pond-dwelling upbringing. In fact, the amniotic egg
brings the pond with them by enclosing the aquatic
environment within its shell. This is achieved by four main upgrades that are unique to amniotic eggs. Let's take a closer look. The first development is the most obvious: the egg's protective shell. It's tough but flexible, and has a leathery surface, still seen in reptile eggs today. The shell protects
the eggs from predators, bacteria, damage, and drying out. But, unlike the walls of a fish tank, the shell of the amniotic egg is porous, allowing oxygen to pass through so that the growing amniote
inside doesn't suffocate. The next two developments
are two separate membranes that work together like a pair of lungs. They bring oxygen into the embryo while removing carbon dioxide. The first is the chorion, which is the protective layer
that oxygen passes through after entering the shell's tiny pores. You may recognize the chorion as the thin skin you peel
away on a hard boiled egg. Think of this waterproof membrane as the in and out doors of the egg. It's the entrance for oxygen and exit for carbon dioxide. The membrane working with the chorion is the allantois. If the chorion is the doors, then the allantois is essentially
the lobby of the building. It directs the oxygen and carbon dioxide while simultaneously storing unneeded waste from the embryo. The chorion and the allantois
make sure the embryo has everything it needs and gets rid of anything it doesn't. The last and perhaps
the most important development is the amnion, the membrane
for which the egg is named. The amnion is also contained
within the chroion and holds the fluid
in which the embryo floats. Because it has left the watery
world of the amphibians, the amnion is necessary for preventing the embryo from drying out. It is the transportable pond that allows the amniote
to lay the egg on dry land. Its fluid also protects the embryo from any collisions or rough landings, like a shock absorber on your bike or car. Together, the shell
and these four membranes create a safe, watery environment for the embryo to grow and develop. The new amniote offspring will continue the process of vertebrate evolution as it explores new land
away from the water. They will spend the next million years splitting into two distinct groups: the synapsids and sauropsids. Synapsida is the group of animals that contain mammals, while sauropsida
is the group that contains reptiles, birds, and dinosaurs. These two amniotic groups
collectively contain the walruses, rattlesnakes, and parakeets we know today. Like a family reunion, with relatives of every shape and size, coming together from different
corners of the Earth, these animals can all call one place home: the amniotic egg.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the time when the amniotic egg evolved. While none of the generated MCQs ask about the specific time of evolution, Question 2 asks about the name of the egg that is shelled, waterproof, and can be laid on dry land, which is related to the concept of the amniotic egg.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ based on the transcript content, I would suggest that there is no matching generated MCQ. But if I really had to choose, I would say Question 2, as it is the only question that talks about the characteristics of the amniotic egg, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ.

away on a hard boiled egg. Think of this waterproof membrane as the in and out doors of the egg. It's the entrance for oxygen and exit for carbon dioxide. The membrane working with the chorion is the allantois. If the chorion is the doors, then the allantois is essentially
the lobby of the building. It directs the oxygen and carbon dioxide while simultaneously storing unneeded waste from the embryo. The chorion and the allantois
make sure the embryo has everything it needs and gets rid of anything it doesn't. The last and perhaps
the most important development is the amnion, the membrane
for which the egg is named. The amnion is also contained
within the chroion and holds the fluid
in which the embryo floats. Because it has left the watery
world of the amphibians, the amnion is necessary for preventing the embryo from drying out. It is the transportable pond that allows the amniote
to lay the egg on dry land. Its fluid also protects the embryo from any collisions or rough landings, like a shock absorber on your bike or car. Together, the shell
and these four membranes create a safe, watery environment for the embryo to grow and develop. The new amniote offspring will continue the process of vertebrate evolution as it explores new land
away from the water. They will spend the next million years splitting into two distinct groups: the synapsids and sauropsids. Synapsida is the group of animals that contain mammals, while sauropsida
is the group that contains reptiles, birds, and dinosaurs. These two amniotic groups
collectively contain the walruses, rattlesnakes, and parakeets we know today. Like a family reunion, with relatives of every shape and size, coming together from different
corners of the Earth, these animals can all call one place home: the amniotic egg.

**Transcript**:
Would you believe that walruses, rattlesnakes, and parakeets all once lived in the same house? Let's go back about 350 million years. Look around. Steamy swamps and rain forests
of horsetails and ferns cover the region. Amphibians are the dominant
land vertebrates. They range in size from newts to crocodiles. And all require water
to do their egg laying. If they don't go to the water, their shell-less, jelly-like
eggs will dry out. Because of this hazard, they spend most of their time living in or near fresh water. That is, until a breakthrough in evolution changes everything: the amniotic egg. The amniotic egg is shelled, waterproof, and can be laid on dry land. It is produced by the amniotes, a new group of animals named
after their revolutionary egg. The first amniote is a tetrapod, a four-legged animal, resembling a small lizard. While some amphibians
can walk around on land and bury their eggs in wet
soil or highly humid areas, nothing before the amniotes
has the ability to lay its eggs on completely dry land. Because of this evolved egg, the amniotes are the first animals with the ability to live
a fully terrestrial life. But, despite their move inland, the amniotes have not abandoned their pond-dwelling upbringing. In fact, the amniotic egg
brings the pond with them by enclosing the aquatic
environment within its shell. This is achieved by four main upgrades that are unique to amniotic eggs. Let's take a closer look. The first development is the most obvious: the egg's protective shell. It's tough but flexible, and has a leathery surface, still seen in reptile eggs today. The shell protects
the eggs from predators, bacteria, damage, and drying out. But, unlike the walls of a fish tank, the shell of the amniotic egg is porous, allowing oxygen to pass through so that the growing amniote
inside doesn't suffocate. The next two developments
are two separate membranes that work together like a pair of lungs. They bring oxygen into the embryo while removing carbon dioxide. The first is the chorion, which is the protective layer
that oxygen passes through after entering the shell's tiny pores. You may recognize the chorion as the thin skin you peel
away on a hard boiled egg. Think of this waterproof membrane as the in and out doors of the egg. It's the entrance for oxygen and exit for carbon dioxide. The membrane working with the chorion is the allantois. If the chorion is the doors, then the allantois is essentially
the lobby of the building. It directs the oxygen and carbon dioxide while simultaneously storing unneeded waste from the embryo. The chorion and the allantois
make sure the embryo has everything it needs and gets rid of anything it doesn't. The last and perhaps
the most important development is the amnion, the membrane
for which the egg is named. The amnion is also contained
within the chroion and holds the fluid
in which the embryo floats. Because it has left the watery
world of the amphibians, the amnion is necessary for preventing the embryo from drying out. It is the transportable pond that allows the amniote
to lay the egg on dry land. Its fluid also protects the embryo from any collisions or rough landings, like a shock absorber on your bike or car. Together, the shell

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Around 1469, a wealthy money changer commissioned a young painter named Sandro Botticelli to paint an altar piece. Botticelli would, of course, become known as one of the greatest painters of the High Renaissance, producing works like "La Primavera" and "The Birth of Venus." But, in 1469, he had not yet earned this reputation. The scene this young artist set out to paint was well-known: the Three Wise Men, or Magi, arriving at the birth place of Jesus Christ. Botticelli would aspire to take this common theme and produce an entirely original work, while asserting himself among the most important citizens of Florence. Many earlier paintings illustrate the Magi arriving at a stable, stately manger, fitting for the son of God. The young Botticelli, however, chose to place the scene in the dilapidated Roman ruin. At the center of this structure, he placed a sturdy rock for Mary and Jesus to sit high above their visitors. With this decision, Botticelli seemed to say Christianity will be built on sturdier stuff than Rome. Botticelli then populated the space with important men from his city. On the right side, he paints the man who paid for this work, Gaspare del Lama, looking out at the viewer and confidently pointing at himself so that there is no question who is responsible for this masterpiece. Though born the son of a barber, del Lama amassed a good sum of money through currency exchange in his lifetime. He earned enough money to buy a burial chapel and decorate it with a pretty painting. The Three Wise Men appear at the center of this painting, kneeling to Mary and Jesus. As models for these important figures, Botticelli used members of the important Medici family. Del Lama's career as a money changer would not have been possible without the help of the powerful Medici family, in particular Cosimo de' Medici, who appears prominently at Mary's feet. The other wise men can be identified as Piero and Giovanni de' Medici, Cosimo's two sons. The business of money exchange had dubious ethical and legal associations, so the friendship of this powerful family was important. And the young heir to Medici power, Lorenzo, could not be omitted from this painting's composition. He appears to the left of the manger. This painting seems to say the Medici legacy, with its many healthy heirs, will be built on sturdier stuff than Rome. Botticelli then filled the rest of the space with other friends and powerful figures from Florence. And, among the Florentine elite, the young, confident artist painted himself looking directly at the viewer. Botticelli's presence in this painting illustrates a radical shift in the perception of artists during this time period. Botticelli did not view himself as a common craftsman hired for a simple job. He viewed himself as a friend to the powerful families of Florence. Paintings like "The Adoration of the Magi" reveal much more than a simple retelling of a biblical story. They can tell the story of, among other things, a modestly-born money changer attempting to spend his money virtuously by making a local chapel more beautiful, or the story of an ambitious young painter, elevating the reputation of his craft to stand among the wealthy elite of his city.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 4, as it also asks about the identification of a specific individual in the painting.

However, since none of the generated MCQs have the same intent as the ground truth MCQ, a more suitable approach would be to create a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ. 

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but with significant differences in the options and the specific individuals being asked about.

A new MCQ could be generated to match the ground truth MCQ, such as:

Question: Which two individuals in Botticelli's painting "The Adoration of the Magi" look directly out at the viewer?
Options: A. Botticelli and del Lama, B. Lorenzo il Magnifico and Jesus, C. Giovanni and Piero

This new MCQ would be a more direct match to the ground truth MCQ.

I'd like to tell you about two games of chess the first happened in 1997 which Garry Kasparov a human lost a deep-blue a machine to many this was the dawn of a new era one where man would be dominated by machine but here we are 20 years on and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the iPad not how the second game was a freestyle chess tournament in 2005 and which man and machine could enter together as partners rather than adversaries if they so chose at first the results were predictable even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster with a relatively weak laptop the surprise came at the end who won not a grandmaster with the supercomputer but actually two American amateurs using three relatively weak laptops their ability to coach and manipulate their computers to deeply explore specific positions effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge of the grandmasters in the superior computational power of other adversaries this is an astonishing result average men average machines beating the best man the best machine and anyways isn't it supposed to be man versus machine instead it's about cooperation and the right type of cooperation we've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years it's a sexy vision for sure many of embraces become the dominant school of thought computer science but as we enter the era of big data of network systems of open platforms and embedded technology I'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time I'm talking about JCR Licklider z' human-computer symbiosis perhaps better termed intelligence augmentation I a wick lighter was a computer science Titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology in the Internet his vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate in making decisions in controlling complex situations without the inflexible dependence on predetermined programs note that word cooperate Lickliter encourages us to take a toaster and make it data from Star Trek but to take a human and make her more capable humans are so amazing how we think our nonlinear approaches our creativity iterative hypotheses all very difficult if possible all for computers to do Lickliter intuitively realized this contemplating humans setting the goals formulating the hypotheses determining the criteria and performing the evaluation of course in other ways humans are so limited were terrible at scale computation and volume we require high-end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing Licklider for saw computers doing all of the routinize herbal work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision-making silently without much fanfare this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess protein folding a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe this is a world-changing problem with huge implications for our ability to understand and treat disease and for this task supercomputer fueled brute force simply isn't enough fully a game created by computer scientists illustrates the value of the approach non technical non biologists amateurs play a video game in which they visually arranged the structure of the protein allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues this approach beats supercomputers 50% of the time and tied 30% of the time folded recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure of the Mason Fischer monkey virus a protease that had eluded determination for ever 10 years was solved by three players in a matter of days perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing the video game last year on the side of the twin towers a 9/11 memorial opened it displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called meaningful adjacency places the names and next to each other based on the relationships to one another friends families co-workers when you put it all together it's quite a computational challenge 3,500 victims 1,800 to JCCC requests the importance of the overall physical specifications in the final aesthetics when first reported by the media full credit for such a feat was given to an algorithm from the New York City design firm local projects the truth is a bit more nuanced while an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework humans use that framework to design the final result so in this case a computer I've evaluated millions of possible layouts manage a complex relational system and kept track of a very large set of measurements and variables allowing the humans to focus on design and compositional choices so the more you look around you the more you see Licklider vision everywhere whether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car or human-computer symbiosis is making us more capable so if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis what can you do you can start by designing the human into the process instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem design the solution around what the human will do as well when you do this you'll quickly realize that you spend all of your time on the interface between man and machine specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction in fact this friction is more important than the power of the man or the power of the machine in determining overall capability that's why two amateurs with a few laptops handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster what Kasparov calls processes a byproduct of friction the better the process the less the friction and minimizing friction turns out to be this isof variable or take another example Big Data every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever-growing array of sensors your phone credit card computer the result is big data and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition the major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on how do I store this data how do I search this data how do i process this data these are necessary but insufficient questions the imperative is not to figure out how to compute but what to compute how do you impose human intuition on data at this scale again we start by designing the human to the process when PayPal was first starting as a business their biggest challenge was not how do I send money back and forth online it was how do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime why so challenging because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns they can't learn to do that based on patterns they've never seen before an organized crime has a lot in common with this audience brilliant people relentlessly resourceful entrepreneurial spirit and one huge and important difference purpose and so while computers alone can catch all about the cleverest fraudsters catching the cleverest it's the difference between success and failure there's a whole class of problems like this ones with adaptive adversaries they rarely if ever present with the repeatable pattern that's discernable to computers instead there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption and increasingly these problems are buried in big data for example terrorism terrorists are always adapting in minor and major ways to new circumstances and despite what you might see on TV these adaptations and the detection of them are fundamentally human computers don't detect novel patterns or new behaviors or humans do humans using technology testing hypotheses searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence he was caught by dedicated resourceful brilliant people in partnerships with various technologies as appealing as it might sound you cannot algorithmically data-mine your way to the answer there is no find terrorists button and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems the less effective data mining can be instead people will have to look at data and search for insight and as Licklider foresaw long ago the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation and as Kasparov realized that means minimizing friction at the interface now this approach makes possible things like combing through all available data from very different sources identifying key relationships and putting of that in one place something that's been nearly impossible to do before the salm this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications to others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance that must be acknowledged and they can't be swept aside even with the best of intense so let's explore through a couple of examples the impact that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis have had in recent time in October 2007 US and coalition forces raided an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar on the Syrian border of Iraq they found a treasure trove of documents 700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters these foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf the Levant in North Africa to join al-qaeda in Iraq these records were human resource forms the foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization it turns out that al-qaeda too is not without its bureaucracy they answered questions like who recruited you what's your hometown what occupation do you seek and that last question a surprising insight was revealed the vast majority of foreign fighters were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom hugely important since between 2003 and 2007 Iraq had thirteen hundred and eighty two suicide bombings a major source of instability analyzing this data was hard the originals were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated the friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational timeframe using humans PDFs and tenacity alone the researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper to explore non-obvious hypotheses and in fact insights emerged 20% of the foreign fighters were from Libya 50% of those from a single town in Libya hugely important since prior statistics but that figure at 3% it also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in Al Quaida Abu Yahya al-libi a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group in March of 2007 he gave a speech after worship was a surge and participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters perhaps most clever of all though and least obvious by flipping the data on its head the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria that were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border these were networks of mercenaries not ideologues who were in the coordination business for profit for example they charged Saudi foreign fighters substantially more than Libyans money that would have otherwise gone to al Qaeda perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they were cheating would-be jihadists in January 2010 a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti third deadliest earthquake of all time left 1 million people 10% of the population homeless one seemingly small aspect of the overall relief ever became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water soccer rolling January and February the dry months in Haiti yet many of the camps had developed standing water the only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's floodplains had been leveled in the earthquake leadership inside so the question is which camps are at risk how many people in these camps what's the timeline for flooding and give it very limited resources infrastructure how do we prioritize the relocation the data was incredibly disparate US Army had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country there was data online from a 2006 environmental risk conference others geospatial data not have been integrated the human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need the computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospatial information social media data and relief organization information to answer this question by implementing a superior process what was otherwise a task for 40 people over three months became a simple job for three people in 40 hours all victories for human-computer symbiosis were more than 50 years into lick lighters vision for the future and the data suggest that we should be quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems man and machine in cooperation together thank you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the closest match would be a question that involves the 2005 freestyle chess tournament or the concept of human-computer symbiosis.

If I had to choose from the generated MCQs, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but it's still not a good match. Question 4 asks about the key to great results in human-computer symbiosis, which is related to the concept of the 2005 freestyle chess tournament, but it doesn't ask about the winners of the tournament.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ. For example:

Question: What was the surprising outcome of the 2005 freestyle chess tournament?
Options: A. A grandmaster with a supercomputer won, B. An amateur with a supercomputer won, C. Amateurs with average machines won, D. A grandmaster with an average machine won

This question is a closer match to the ground truth MCQ, but it's still not among the generated MCQs.

Index: None (or 4, if you consider it a weak match)

compute how do you impose human intuition on data at this scale again we start by designing the human to the process when PayPal was first starting as a business their biggest challenge was not how do I send money back and forth online it was how do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime why so challenging because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on

despite what you might see on TV these adaptations and the detection of them are fundamentally human computers don't detect novel patterns or new behaviors or humans do humans using technology testing hypotheses searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence he was caught by dedicated resourceful brilliant people in partnerships with various technologies as appealing as it might sound you cannot algorithmically data-mine your way to the answer there is no find terrorists button and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems the less effective data mining can be instead people will have to look at data and search for insight and as Licklider foresaw long ago the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation and as Kasparov realized that means minimizing friction at the interface now this approach makes possible things like combing through all available data from very different sources identifying key relationships and putting of that in one place something that's been nearly impossible to do before the salm this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications to others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance that must be acknowledged and they can't be swept aside even with the best of intense so let's explore through a couple of examples the impact that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis have had in recent time in October 2007 US and coalition forces raided an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar on the Syrian border of Iraq they found a treasure trove of documents 700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters these foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf the Levant in North Africa to join al-qaeda in Iraq these records were human resource forms the foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization it turns out that al-qaeda too is not without its bureaucracy they answered questions like who recruited you what's your hometown what occupation do you seek and that last question a surprising insight was revealed the vast majority of foreign fighters were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom hugely important since between 2003 and 2007 Iraq had thirteen hundred and eighty two suicide bombings a major source of instability analyzing this data was hard the originals were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated the friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational timeframe using humans PDFs and tenacity alone the researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper to explore non-obvious hypotheses and in fact insights emerged 20% of the foreign fighters were from Libya 50% of those from a single town in Libya hugely important since prior statistics but that figure at 3% it also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in Al Quaida Abu Yahya al-libi a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group in March of 2007 he gave a speech after worship was a surge and participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters perhaps most clever of all though and least obvious by flipping the data on its head the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria that were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border these were networks of mercenaries not ideologues who were in the coordination business for profit for example they charged Saudi foreign fighters substantially more than Libyans money that would have otherwise gone to al Qaeda perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they were cheating would-be jihadists in January 2010 a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti third deadliest earthquake of all time left 1 million people 10% of the population homeless one seemingly small aspect of the overall relief ever became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water soccer rolling January and February the dry months in Haiti yet many of the camps had developed standing water the only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's floodplains had been leveled in the earthquake leadership inside so the question is which camps are at risk how many people in these camps what's the timeline for flooding and give it very limited resources infrastructure how do we prioritize the relocation the data was incredibly disparate US Army had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country there was data online from a 2006 environmental risk conference others geospatial data not have been integrated the human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need the computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospatial information social media data and relief organization information to answer this question by implementing a superior process what was otherwise a task for 40 people over three months became a simple job for three people in 40

the less the friction and minimizing friction turns out to be this isof variable or take another example Big Data every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever-growing array of sensors your phone credit card computer the result is big data and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition the major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on how do I store this data how do I search this data how do i process this data these are necessary but insufficient questions the imperative is not to figure out how to compute but what to compute how do you impose human intuition on data at this scale again we start by designing the human to the process when PayPal was first starting as a business their biggest challenge was not how do I send money back and forth online it was how do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime why so challenging because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns they can't learn to do that based on patterns they've never seen before an organized crime has a lot in common with this audience brilliant people relentlessly resourceful entrepreneurial spirit and one huge and important difference purpose and so while computers alone can catch all about the cleverest fraudsters catching the cleverest it's the difference between success and failure there's a whole class of problems like this ones with adaptive adversaries they rarely if ever present with the repeatable pattern that's discernable to computers instead there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption and increasingly these problems are buried in big data for example terrorism terrorists are always adapting in minor and major ways to new circumstances and despite what you might see on TV these adaptations and the detection of them are fundamentally human computers don't detect novel patterns or new behaviors or humans do humans using technology testing hypotheses searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence he was caught by dedicated resourceful brilliant people in partnerships with various technologies as appealing as it might sound you cannot algorithmically data-mine your way to the answer there is no find terrorists button and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems the less effective data mining can be instead people will have to look at data and search for insight and as Licklider foresaw long ago the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation and as Kasparov realized that means minimizing friction at the interface now this approach makes possible things like combing through all available data from very different sources identifying key relationships and putting of that in one place something that's been nearly impossible to do before the salm this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications to others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance that must be acknowledged and they can't be swept aside even with the best of intense so let's explore through a couple of examples the impact that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis have had in recent time in October 2007 US and coalition forces raided an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar on the Syrian border of Iraq they found a treasure trove of documents 700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters these foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf the Levant in North Africa to join al-qaeda in Iraq these records were human resource forms the foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization it turns out that al-qaeda too is not without its bureaucracy they answered questions like who recruited you what's your hometown what occupation do you seek and that last question a surprising insight was revealed the vast majority of foreign fighters were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom hugely important since between 2003 and 2007 Iraq had thirteen hundred and eighty two suicide bombings a major source of instability analyzing this data was hard the originals were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated the friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational timeframe using humans PDFs and tenacity alone the researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper to explore non-obvious hypotheses and in fact insights emerged 20% of the foreign fighters were from Libya 50% of those from a single town in Libya hugely important since prior statistics but that figure at 3% it also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in Al Quaida Abu Yahya al-libi a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group in March of 2007 he gave a speech after worship was a surge and participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters perhaps most clever of all though and least obvious by flipping the data on its head the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria that were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border these were networks of mercenaries not ideologues who were in the coordination business for profit for example they charged Saudi foreign fighters substantially more than Libyans money that would have otherwise gone to al Qaeda perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they were cheating would-be jihadists in January 2010 a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti third deadliest earthquake of all time left 1 million people 10% of the population homeless one seemingly small aspect of the overall relief ever became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water soccer rolling January and February the dry months in Haiti yet many of the camps had developed standing water the only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's floodplains had been leveled in the earthquake leadership inside so the question is which camps are at risk how many people in these camps what's the timeline for flooding and give it very limited resources infrastructure how do we prioritize the relocation the data was incredibly disparate US Army had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country there was data online from a 2006 environmental risk conference others geospatial data not have been integrated the human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need the computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospatial information social media data and relief organization information to answer this question by implementing a superior process what was otherwise a task for 40 people over three months became a simple job for three people in 40 hours all victories for human-computer symbiosis were more than 50 years into lick lighters vision for the future and the data suggest that we should be quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems man and machine in cooperation together thank you

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 10: What was the seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort in Haiti that became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the task that was efficiently completed with human and computer partnerships following the earthquake in Haiti, and the correct answer is "Prioritizing relocation of camps based on flood risk." Question 10 mentions the relocation of camps, which is related to the correct answer of the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 10 is the most similar, but it would be better to generate new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Window, an opening constructed in a wall to emit light or air. When the Scandinavian settlers invaded England in the Middle Ages, they brought with them a whole slew of words whose modern descendants have become part of our everyday vernacular. Their word for window was related to the Old Norse word for the same architectural feature, vindauga. Vindauga was a compound, composed of two separate words: vindr, meaning wind and auga, meaning eye. The word vindauga was probably quite old, having come into being long before windows were made of glass. This type of metaphoric compound, called a kenning, was very popular in both Norse and Old English. The beautiful literary trope was used in the Norse word for ship, literally "wave stead." And, in the epic poem, "Beowulf," where the sea is described as a whale road and blood is described as battle sweat and slaughter dew. From its literal yet lyrical beginning, the word window has expanded beyond its concrete definition as a construction or design element to be used figuratively in phrases like the poetic "window of opportunity."

[Music] [Applause] look i had second thoughts really about whether i could talk about this to such a vital and a live audience as you guys but then i remember the quote from gloria steinem which goes the truth will set you free but first it will piss you off [Laughter] so so with that in mind i'm going to set about trying to do those things here and talk about dying in the 21st century now the first thing that will piss you off undoubtedly is that all of us are in fact going to die in the 21st century there will be no exceptions to that um there are apparently about one in eight of you who think you're immortal on surveys but unfortunately that doesn't this isn't going to happen um while i give this talk in the next 10 minutes 100 million of my cells will die and over the course of today 2000 of my brain cells will die and never come back so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece anyway the second thing i want to say about dying in the 21st century apart from what's going to happen to everybody is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on so there you go that's the truth no doubt that will piss you off and now let's see whether we can set you free i don't promise anything now as you heard in the intro i work in intensive care and i think i've kind of lived through the heyday of intensive care this has been a ride man this has been fantastic we have machines that go ping there's many of them up there and we have some wizard technology which i think has worked really well and over the course of the time i've worked in intensive care the death rate for males in australia has halved and intensive care has had something to do with that certainly a lot of the technologies that we use have got something to do with that so we have had tremendous success and we we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit and we started using expressions like life-saving i really apologize to everybody for doing that because obviously we don't what we do is prolong people's lives and delay death and redirect death but we we can't strictly speaking save lives on any sort of permanent basis and what's really happened over the period of time that i've been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the 70s 80s and 90s are now coming to die in the 21st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to in quite the way we did then so what's happening now is there's been a big shift in the way that people die and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable to what we can do as what it used to be like when i was doing this in the 80s and 90s so we kind of we kind of got a bit caught up with this and we haven't really squared with you guys about what's really happening now and it's about time we did i kind of woke up to this bit in the late 90s when i met this guy this guy is called jim jim smith and he looked like this i was called down to the ward to see him his is the little hand i was called down the wall to see him by a respiratory physician he he said look there's a guy down here he's got pneumonia and he looks like he needs intensive care his daughter's here and she wants everything possible to be done which is a familiar phrase to to us so i go down to the ward and see gym and his skin is translucent like this you can see his bones through the skin he's very very thin and he is indeed very very sick with pneumonia and he's too sick to talk to me so i talked to his daughter kathleen and i say to her did you and jim ever talk about what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation and she looked at me and said no of course not i thought okay take this steady um and i got talking to her and after a while she said to me you know we always thought there'd be time jim was 94. and i realized that something wasn't happening here there wasn't this dialogue going on that i imagined was happening so a group of us started doing survey work and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in newcastle in the newcastle area and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their heart stopped beating one in a hundred and only one in 500 of them had a plan about what to do if they became seriously ill i realized of course this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large and i work in acute care this is john hunter hospital and i thought surely we we do better than that so a colleague of mine from nursing called lisa shaw and i went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had any had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die and we didn't find a single record of any preference about goals treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient so we started to realize that we had a problem and the problem is more serious because of this what we know is that obviously we are all going to die but how we die is actually really important obviously not just to us but also to how that features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards how we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us and the stress created in families by dying is enormous and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else so dying in intensive care is not your top option if if you've got a choice and if that wasn't bad enough of course all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you in fact about one in 10 of you at this point will die in intensive care in the us it's one in five in miami it's three out of five people die in intensive care so this is the sort of momentum that we've got at the moment the reason why this is all happening is due to this and i do have to take you through what this is about these are the four ways to go so one of these will happen to all of us the ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical interest sudden death it's quite likely in an audience this size this won't happen to anybody here sudden death has become very rare the death of little nail and cordelia and all that sort of stuff just doesn't happen anymore the dying process of those with terminal illness that we've just seen occurs to younger people by the time you've reached 80 this is unlikely to happen to you only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer the big growth industry are these what you die of is increasing organ failure with your respiratory cardiac renal whatever organs packing up each of these would be an admission to an acute care hospital at the end of which or at some point during which somebody says enough is enough and we stop and this one's the biggest growth industry of all and at least six out of ten of the people in this room will die this form which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing frailty and frailty is an inevitable part of aging and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing that people die of now and the last few years or last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability unfortunately enjoying it so far sorry i just feel such a i feel such a cassandra here um what can i say that's positive what's positive is that this is happening at very great age now we are we are all most of us living to to reach this point you know historically we didn't do that this is what happens to you when you live to be a great age and unfortunately increasing longevity does mean more old age not more youth i'm sorry to say that um what we did anyway look what we did we didn't just take this lying down at john hunter hospital and elsewhere we've started a whole series of projects to try and look about whether we could in fact involve people much more in the way that in the way that things happen to them but we realize of course that we are dealing with cultural issues um and this is i love this climped painting because if the more you look at it the more you kind of get the whole issue that's going on here which is clearly the death the separation of death from the living and the fear like if you actually look there's one woman there who has her eyes open she's the one he's looking at and he's the one he's coming for can you see that she looks terrified it's an amazing picture anyway we had a major cultural issue clearly people didn't want us to talk about death oh we thought that so with loads of funding from the federal government and the local health service we introduced the thing that john hunter called respecting patient choices we trained hundreds of people to go to the wards and talk to people about the fact that they would die and what would they prefer under those circumstances they loved it the families and the patients they loved it nine uh 98 of people really thought this just should be normal practice and that this is how things should work and when they express wishes all of those wishes came true as it were we were able to make that happen for them but then when the funding ran out we went back to look six months later and everybody had stopped again and nobody was having these conversations anymore so that was really kind of heartbreaking for us because we thought this was going to really take off the cultural issue had reasserted itself so here's the pitch i think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway to icu without thinking hard about whether or not that's where we all want to end up particularly as we come older and increasingly frail and icu has less and less and less to offer us there has to be a little side road off there for people who don't want to go on that track and i have one small idea and uh one big idea about what could happen and this is a small idea the small idea is let's all of us engage with more with this in the way that jason has illustrated why can't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this there are a couple of things you can do one of them is um you can er just ask this simple question this this question never fails in the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself who would you like to speak for you that's a really important question to ask people because giving people the control over who that is produces an amazing outcome the second thing you can say is have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we can got a better idea of what it is we can do so that's a little idea the big idea i think is more political i think we have to get onto this i i suggested we should have occupied death my wife said i said rio right sitting's in the mortuary yeah yeah sure so that one didn't really run but i did i was very struck by this now i'm in aging hippie is i don't know i don't think i look like that anymore but um i had two two of my kids were born at home in the in the 80s when home birth was a big thing and now we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation so if you just replace all these all these words of birth i like peace love natural death as a as an option i do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which it's going now listen that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia i want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all i hate euthanasia i think it's a sideshow i don't think euthanasia matters i actually think that that in country in places like oregon where you can have physician-assisted suicide you take a poisonous dose of stuff only half a percent of people ever do that i'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent of people who don't want to do that i think most people don't want to be dead but i do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds so i'm an opponent of euthanasia but i do think we have to give people back some control it deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply i think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all this is a quote from from dame sicily saunders whom i met when i was a medical student she she founded the hospice movement and she says you matter because you are and you matter to the last moment of your life and i firmly believe that that's the message that we have to carry forward thank you [Music]

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of Peter Saul's cells that died while watching the talk. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs address this specific topic.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is vaguely related to the topic of cells or death, I would suggest Question 2: "According to the speaker, what is the most common reason for death in people over 80?" This question is not directly related to the number of cells that died, but it does address the topic of death and aging, which is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

Please note that this is a weak match, and I would not recommend using Question 2 as a substitute for the ground truth MCQ.

intensive care has had something to do with that certainly a lot of the technologies that we use have got something to do with that so we have had tremendous success and we we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit and we started using expressions like life-saving i really apologize to everybody for doing that because obviously we don't what we do is prolong people's lives and delay death and redirect death but we we can't strictly speaking save lives on any sort of permanent basis and what's really happened over the period of time that i've been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the 70s 80s and 90s are now coming to die in the 21st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to in quite the way we did then so what's happening now is there's been a big shift in the way that people die and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable to what we can do as what it used to be like when i was doing this in the 80s and 90s so we kind of we kind of got a bit caught up with this and we haven't really squared with you guys about what's really happening now and it's about time we did i kind of woke up to this bit in the late 90s when i met this guy this guy is called jim jim smith and he looked like this i was called down to the ward to see him his is the little hand i was called down the wall to see him by a respiratory physician he he said look there's a guy down here he's got pneumonia and he looks like he needs intensive care his daughter's here and she wants everything possible to be done which is a familiar phrase to to us so i go down to the ward and see gym and his skin is translucent like this you can see his bones through the skin he's very very thin and he is indeed very very sick with pneumonia and he's too sick to talk to me so i talked to his daughter kathleen and i say to her did you and jim ever talk about what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation and she looked at me and said no of course not i thought okay take this steady um and i got talking to her and after a while she said to me you know we always thought there'd be time jim was 94. and i realized that something wasn't happening here there wasn't this dialogue going on that i imagined was happening so a group of us started doing survey work and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in newcastle in the newcastle area and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their heart stopped beating one in a hundred and only one in 500 of them had a plan about what to do if they became seriously ill i realized of course this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large and i work in acute care this is john hunter hospital and i thought surely we we do better than that so a colleague of mine from nursing called lisa shaw and i went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had any had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die and we didn't find a single record of any preference about goals treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient so we started to realize that we had a problem and the problem is more serious because of this what we know is that obviously we are all going to die but how we die is actually really important obviously not just to us but also to how that features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards how we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us and the stress created in families by dying is enormous and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else so dying in intensive care is not your top option if if you've got a choice and if that wasn't bad enough of course all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you in fact about one in 10 of you at this point will die in intensive care in the us it's one in five in miami it's three out of five people die in intensive care so this is the sort of momentum that we've got at the moment the reason why this is all happening is due to this and i do have to take you through what this is about these are the four ways to go so one of these will happen to all of us the ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical interest sudden death it's quite likely in an audience this size this won't happen to anybody here sudden death has become very rare the death of little nail and cordelia and all that sort of stuff just doesn't happen anymore the dying process of those with terminal illness that we've just seen occurs to younger people by the time you've reached 80 this is unlikely to happen to you only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer the big growth industry are these what you die of is increasing organ failure with your respiratory cardiac renal whatever organs packing up each of these would be an admission to an acute care hospital at the end of which or at some point during which somebody says enough is enough and we stop and this one's the biggest growth industry of all and at least six out of ten of the people in this room will die this form which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing frailty and frailty is an inevitable part of aging and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing that people die of now and the last few years or last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability unfortunately enjoying it so far sorry i just feel such a i feel such a cassandra here um what can i say that's positive what's positive is that this is happening at very great age now we are we are all most of us living to to reach this point you know historically we didn't do that this is what happens to you when you live to be a great age and unfortunately increasing longevity does mean more old age not more youth i'm sorry to say that um what we did anyway look what we did we didn't just take this lying down at john hunter hospital and elsewhere we've started a whole series of projects to try and look about whether we could in fact involve people much more in the way that in the way that things happen to them but we realize of course that we are dealing with cultural issues um and this is i love this climped painting because if the more you look at it the more you kind of get the whole issue that's going on here which is clearly the death the separation of death from the living and the fear like if you actually look there's one woman there who has her eyes open she's the one he's looking at and he's the one he's coming for can you see that she looks terrified it's an amazing picture anyway we had a major cultural issue clearly people didn't want us to talk about death oh we thought that so with loads of funding from the federal government and the local health service we introduced the thing that john hunter called respecting patient choices we trained hundreds of people to go to the wards and talk to people about the fact that they would die and what would they prefer under those circumstances they loved it the families and the patients they loved it nine uh 98 of people really thought this just should be normal practice and that this is how things should work and when they express wishes all of those wishes came true as it were we were able to make that happen for them but then when the funding ran out we went back to look six months later and everybody had stopped again and nobody was having these conversations anymore so that was really kind of heartbreaking for us because we thought this was going to really take off the cultural issue had reasserted itself so here's the pitch i think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway to icu without thinking hard about whether or not that's where we all want to end up particularly as we come older and increasingly frail and icu has less and less and less to offer us there has to be a little side road off there for people who don't want to go on that track and i have one small idea and uh one big idea about what could happen and this is a small idea the small idea is let's all of us engage with more with this in the way that jason has illustrated why can't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this there are a couple of things you can do one of them is um you can er just ask this simple question this this question never fails in the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself who would you like to speak for you that's a really important question to ask people because giving people the control over who that is produces an amazing outcome the second thing you can say is have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we can got a better idea of what it is we can do so that's a little idea the big idea i think is more political i think we have to get onto this i i suggested we should have occupied death my wife said i said rio right sitting's in the mortuary yeah yeah sure so that one didn't really run but i did i was very struck by this now i'm in aging hippie is i don't know i don't think i look like that anymore but um i had two two of my kids were born at home in the in the 80s when home birth was a big thing and now we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation so if you just replace all these all these words of birth i like peace love natural death as a as an option i do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which it's going now listen that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia i want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all i hate euthanasia i think it's a sideshow i don't think euthanasia matters i actually think that that in country in places like oregon where you can have physician-assisted suicide you take a poisonous dose of stuff only half a percent of people ever do that i'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent of people who don't want to do that i think most people don't want to be dead but i do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds so i'm an opponent of euthanasia but i do think we have to give people back some control it deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply i think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all this is a quote from from dame sicily saunders whom i met when i was a medical student she she founded the hospice movement and she says you matter because you are and you matter to the last moment of your life and i firmly believe that that's the message that we have to carry forward thank you [Music]

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can suggest a match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what surprised Peter Saul during his interaction with Jim and Kathleen. The correct answer is that Jim and Kathleen had never discussed the possibility of Jim's becoming sick or dying.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, as it discusses the issue of people not wanting to discuss death. However, it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 9 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about Peter Saul's interaction with Jim and Kathleen.

Index: 9 (Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be required to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.)

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] look i had second thoughts really about whether i could talk about this to such a vital and a live audience as you guys but then i remember the quote from gloria steinem which goes the truth will set you free but first it will piss you off [Laughter] so so with that in mind i'm going to set about trying to do those things here and talk about dying in the 21st century now the first thing that will piss you off undoubtedly is that all of us are in fact going to die in the 21st century there will be no exceptions to that um there are apparently about one in eight of you who think you're immortal on surveys but unfortunately that doesn't this isn't going to happen um while i give this talk in the next 10 minutes 100 million of my cells will die and over the course of today 2000 of my brain cells will die and never come back so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece anyway the second thing i want to say about dying in the 21st century apart from what's going to happen to everybody is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on so there you go that's the truth no doubt that will piss you off and now let's see whether we can set you free i don't promise anything now as you heard in the intro i work in intensive care and i think i've kind of lived through the heyday of intensive care this has been a ride man this has been fantastic we have machines that go ping there's many of them up

80s and 90s so we kind of we kind of got a bit caught up with this and we haven't really squared with you guys about what's really happening now and it's about time we did i kind of woke up to this bit in the late 90s when i met this guy this guy is called jim jim smith and he looked like this i was called down to the ward to see him his is the little hand i was called down the wall to see him by a respiratory physician he he said look there's a guy down here he's got pneumonia and he looks like he needs intensive care his daughter's here and she wants everything possible to be done which is a familiar phrase to to us so i go down to the ward and see gym and his skin is translucent like this you can see his bones through the skin he's very very thin and he is indeed very very sick with pneumonia and he's too sick to talk to me so i talked to his daughter kathleen and i say to her did you and jim ever talk about what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation and she looked at me and said no of course not i thought okay take this steady um and i got talking to her and after a while she said to me you know we always thought there'd be time jim was 94. and i realized that something wasn't happening here there wasn't this dialogue going on that i imagined was happening so a group of us started doing survey work and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in newcastle in the newcastle area and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their heart stopped beating one in a hundred and only one in 500 of them had a plan about what to do if they became seriously ill i realized of course this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large and i work in acute care this is john hunter hospital and i thought surely we we do better than that so a colleague of mine from nursing called lisa shaw and i went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had any had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die and we didn't find a single record of any preference about goals treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient so we started to realize that we had a problem and the problem is more serious because of this what we know is that obviously we are all going to die but how we die is actually really important obviously not just to us but also to how that features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards how we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us and the stress created in families by dying is enormous and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else so dying in intensive care is not your top option if if you've got a choice and if that wasn't bad enough of course all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you in fact about one in 10 of you at this point will die in intensive care in the us it's one in five in miami it's three out of five people die in intensive care so this is the sort of momentum that we've got at the moment the reason why this is all happening is due to this and i do have to take you through what this is about these are the four ways to go so one of these will happen to all of us the ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical interest sudden death it's quite likely in an audience this size this won't happen to anybody here sudden death has become very rare the death of little nail and cordelia and all that sort of stuff just doesn't happen anymore the dying process of those with terminal illness that we've just seen occurs to younger people by the time you've reached 80 this is unlikely to happen to you only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer the big growth industry are these what you die of is increasing organ failure with your respiratory cardiac renal whatever organs packing up each of these would be an admission to an acute care hospital at the end of which or at some point during which somebody says enough is enough and we stop and this one's the biggest growth industry of all and at least six out of ten of the people in this room will die this form which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing frailty and frailty is an inevitable part of aging and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing that people die of now and the last few years or last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability unfortunately enjoying it so far sorry i just feel such a i feel such a cassandra here um what can i say that's positive what's positive is that this is happening at very great age now we are we are all most of us living to to reach this point you know historically we didn't do that this is what happens to you when you live to be a great age and unfortunately increasing longevity does mean more old age not more youth i'm sorry to say that um what we did anyway look what we did we didn't just take this lying down at john hunter hospital and elsewhere we've started a whole series of projects to try and look about whether we could in fact involve people much more in the way that in the way that things happen to them but we realize of course that we are dealing with cultural issues um and this is i love this climped painting because if the more you look at it the more you kind of get the whole issue that's going on here which is clearly the death the separation of death from the living and the fear like if you actually look there's one woman there who has her eyes open she's the one he's looking at and he's the one he's coming for can you see that she looks terrified it's an amazing picture anyway we had a major cultural issue clearly people didn't want us to talk about death oh we thought that so with loads of funding from the federal government and the local health service we introduced the thing that john hunter called respecting patient choices we trained hundreds of people to go to the wards and talk to people about the fact that they would die and what would they prefer under those circumstances they loved it the families and the patients they loved it nine uh 98 of people really thought this just should be normal practice and that this is how things should work and when they express wishes all of those wishes came true as it were we were able to make that happen for them but then when the funding ran out we went back to look six months later and everybody had stopped again and nobody was having these conversations anymore so that was really kind of heartbreaking for us because we thought this was going to really take off the cultural issue had reasserted itself so here's the pitch i think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway to icu without thinking hard about whether or not that's where we all want to end up particularly as we come older and increasingly frail and icu has less and less and less to offer us there has to be a little side road off there for people who don't want to go on that track and i have one small idea and uh one big idea about what could happen and this is a small idea the small idea is let's all of us engage with more with this in the way that jason has illustrated why can't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this there are a couple of things you can do one of them is um you can er just ask this simple question this this question never fails in the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself who would you like to speak for you that's a really important question to ask people because giving people the control over who that is produces an amazing outcome the second thing you can say is have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we can got a better idea of what it is we can do so that's a little idea the big idea i think is more political i think we have to get onto this i i suggested we should have occupied death my wife said i said rio right sitting's in the mortuary yeah yeah sure so that one didn't really run but i did i was very struck by this now i'm in aging hippie is i don't know i don't think i look like that anymore but um i had two two of my kids were born at home in the in the 80s when home birth was a big thing and now we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation so if you just replace all these all these words of birth i like peace love natural death as a as an option i do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which it's going now listen that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia i want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all i hate euthanasia i think it's a sideshow i don't think euthanasia matters i actually think that that in country in places like oregon where you can have physician-assisted suicide you take a poisonous dose of stuff only half a percent of people ever do that i'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent of people who don't want to do that i think most people don't want to be dead but i do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds so i'm an opponent of euthanasia but i do think we have to give people back some control it deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply i think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all this is a quote from from dame sicily saunders whom i met when i was a medical student she she founded the hospice movement and she says you matter because you are and you matter to the last moment of your life and i firmly believe that that's the message that we have to carry forward thank you [Music]

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: Why did the speaker think that the project "Respecting Patient Choices" was not sustainable? Options: A. Lack of funding, B. Lack of support from healthcare staff, C. Cultural issues, D. All of the above**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the reaction to the Respecting Patient Choices program.

A more suitable match would be:

**Question 3: What was the name of the project introduced at John Hunter Hospital to involve patients in their care? Options: A. Respecting Patient Choices, B. Patient-Centered Care, C. Dying with Dignity, D. End-of-Life Care**

But this question is about the name of the project, not the reaction to it.

If I had to choose one, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not among the provided options, but if I had to choose one, I would say:

**None of the above, but Question 4 is the closest.**

However, I can try to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ:

**New Question: What was the reaction of patients and their families to the Respecting Patient Choices program at John Hunter Hospital? Options: A. They were uncomfortable with the idea of discussing death, B. They appreciated the program and thought it should be normal hospital practice, C. They were so enthusiastic about the program that they continued the dialogue even after funding ran out, D. They voiced frustration at the hospital’s inability to fulfill their wishes**

This new question matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one from the original list, I would say:

**Index: 4 (but not a perfect match)**

[Music] [Applause] look i had second thoughts really about whether i could talk about this to such a vital and a live audience as you guys but then i remember the quote from gloria steinem which goes the truth will set you free but first it will piss you off [Laughter] so so with that in mind i'm going to set about trying to do those things here and talk about dying in the 21st century now the first thing that will piss you off undoubtedly is that all of us are in fact going to die in the 21st century there will be no exceptions to that um there are apparently about one in eight of you who think you're immortal on surveys but unfortunately that doesn't this isn't going to happen um while i give this talk in the next 10 minutes 100 million of my cells will die and over the course of today 2000 of my brain cells will die and never come back so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece anyway the second thing i want to say about dying in the 21st century apart from what's going to happen to everybody is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on so there you go that's the truth no doubt that will piss you off and now let's see whether we can set you free i don't promise anything now as you heard in the intro i work in intensive care and i think i've kind of lived through the heyday of intensive care this has been a ride man this has been fantastic we have machines that go ping there's many of them up there and we have some wizard technology which i think has worked really well and over the course of the time i've worked in intensive care the death rate for males in australia has halved and intensive care has had something to do with that certainly a lot of the technologies that we use have got something to do with that so we have had tremendous success and we we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit and we started using expressions like life-saving i really apologize to everybody for doing that because obviously we don't what we do is prolong people's lives and delay death and redirect death but we we can't strictly speaking save lives on any sort of permanent basis and what's really happened over the period of time that i've been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the 70s 80s and 90s are now coming to die in the 21st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to in quite the way we did then so what's happening now is there's been a big shift in the way that people die and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable to what we can do as what it used to be like when i was doing this in the 80s and 90s so we kind of we kind of got a bit caught up with this and we haven't really squared with you guys about what's really happening now and it's about time we did i kind of woke up to this

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Bedirhan Cinar
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Dynamite, an explosive consisting of nitroglycerin, typically molded into sticks. Dynamite, which coincidentally is closely related to the word dynasty, has as much to do with familial persuasion as it does etymology. Following in the footsteps of his inventor father, Alfred Nobel took up engineering. In 1850, he was exposed to the work of Ascanio Sobrero, the chemist who invented nitroglycerin. More powerful than gun powder and extremely unpredictable, this highly explosive liquid captivated Alfred. Working closely with his father, he began experimenting with nitroglycerin, searching for a practical application for the compound. After several explosions, including one that killed Alfred's brother, authorities banned nitroglycerin tests within Stockholm city limits. Undeterred, Alfred moved his lab and began experimenting with additives, eventually finding one that transformed the dangerous liquid into malleable paste, easier to handle and perfect for construction sites. He named this material dynamite, from the Greek dunamis, meaning power, and the common scientific suffix -ite. Explosives made Alfred a very wealthy man. And, in an effort to balance the destruction caused by his invention, he created an endowment that would award Nobel Prizes to authors, scientists, and advocates of world peace for generations to come.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What was Alfred Nobel's profession?
Options: A. He was a chemist and an inventor, B. Though he was formally trained in chemistry, he was a laboratory technician and an inventor, C. He was an engineer and an inventor, D. He was a medical doctor and an inventor
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQs**:
Question 1: What is the primary component of dynamite? Options: A. Nitroglycerin Correct Option: None
Question 2: Who is credited with inventing nitroglycerin? Options:  Correct Option: None
Question 3: Why was nitroglycerin initially difficult to handle? Options:  Correct Option: None
Question 4: What was the result of Alfred Nobel's collaboration with his father? Options:  Correct Option: None

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Alfred Nobel's profession, and the correct option is "He was an engineer and an inventor." Among the generated MCQs, Question 4: "What was the result of Alfred Nobel's collaboration with his father?" is the closest in terms of relevance to Alfred Nobel's profession. However, it does not directly ask about his profession.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about Alfred Nobel's profession or background. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs match this criteria. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4 (with a note that it's not a good match)

To improve the matching, I would suggest generating new MCQs that directly ask about Alfred Nobel's profession, background, or education. This would increase the chances of finding a better match with the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby In the 11th and 12th centuries, most English commoners were illiterate. Since they had no way to learn the Bible, the clergy came up with an inventive solution: they'd create plays out of certain Bible stories so even people who couldn't read could learn them. These were called mystery plays because they revealed the mystery of God's word. At about the same time, the clergy also developed plays about the saints of the church, called miracle plays. In the beginning, the clergy members acted out Bible stories on the steps outside the cathedral. The audience reacted so well that soon they needed to move out to the street around the town square. By building moving carts to put on each play and by lining up one after the other, they could put on cycles of stories, which would take the viewer from Genesis to Revelation. These movable carts, called pageants, looked like huge boxes on wheels. Each was two stories tall. The bottom story was curtained off and was used for costumes, props, and dressing. The top platform was the stage for the performance. Spectators assembled in various corners of the town, and the pageant would move around in the cycle until the villagers had seen the entire series. Soon, the plays required more actors than the clergy could supply. So, by the 13th century, different guilds were asked to be responsible for acting out different parts of the cycle. The assignments were meant to reflect the guilds' professions. For example, the carpenter's guild might put on the story of Noah's Ark, and the baker's guild might put on The Last Supper. Can you imagine what might happen to the story if the butcher's guild put on The Crucifixion of Christ? Yes, without the clergy, the plays soon started changing from their true Bible stories. By the end of the 14th century, a new form of drama, called the morality play, had evolved. Faith, truth, charity, and good deeds all became characters on the stage. And, at the same time, the opposite virtues of falsehood, covetousness, worldly flesh, and the devil became the antagonists. The morality plays were allegorical stories in which these characters battled for the control of the soul. Audiences loved the immoral characters, and spectators were encouraged to interact with the actors. Throwing rotten food and even getting into scuffles with other spectators became very common. The character of the devil often would roam through the crowds and pull unsuspecting watchers into a hell that was depicted as a dragon's mouth. The virtuous Biblical stories had morphed into crude and sometimes comic stories. The clergy intended to teach against immorality. How ironic, then, that the morality plays actually encouraged vices as more popular than virtues. By the mid-15th century, the church started to outlaw these performances. Town charters required that any theater must be built outside the city wall. One of the first theaters was built like a larger version of a pageant, with tiers of gallery seating encircling a grassy area in front of the stage. Sound familiar? A young William Shakespeare developed his craft here at the theater that was eventually renamed The Globe. The medieval morality play had led to Renaissance playwrights who were inspired by the inner struggles and the conscience of man. And that, in essence, is how drama emerged as a literary art form.

However, the correct answer in the generated MCQ does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable generated MCQ would directly ask about the group that began drama in England.

A more suitable match can be found in the transcript content that mentions "the clergy came up with an inventive solution: they'd create plays out of certain Bible stories so even people who couldn't read could learn them." This is similar to Question 1, but it does not directly ask about the group.

If we were to choose from the existing generated MCQs, the closest match would be Question 1, as it mentions the clergy's solution, which implies that they are the group that began drama in England.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the order in which the plays were developed, with options including Mystery, Miracle, and Morality plays.

While there isn't a direct match, I found that Question 5: "What was the new form of drama that evolved by the end of the 14th century?" is somewhat related, as it mentions the evolution of a new form of drama, which could be linked to the development of different types of plays.

However, a closer match would be a question that asks about the different types of plays and their order of development. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would suggest Question 5, but with a note that it's not a direct match.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby These are grizzly bears. As you can see, they have big teeth and giant claws. But once you get to know them better, they're not as ferocious as you might think. They play a critical role in the function of our ecosystems, but, unfortunately, their habitat is dwindling fast. In order to protect them, it's important to know why do grizzlies choose certain areas to inhabit in the first place? Let's look at a threatened population of bears living in the rocky mountains of Canada. Remember those giant claws? Well, they're not for what you might think. They have evolved specifically for digging up energy-rich roots. It turns out that grizzlies eat a lot of plants. The ones that live here are almost vegetarians. You see, unlike other predators, grizzlies have diverse diets that can include up to 90% vegetation. However, maintaining a diet of plants can be difficult. In these northern latitudes, you have distinct seasons where it's really nice and green for part of the year and really cold for the other part. If you eat plants, you have almost nothing to eat for the cold part of the year. So, you either have to migrate like geese or hibernate like ground squirrels. Grizzly bears hibernate. Their behaviors are closely synchronized with the seasons. During the summer, they have to pack on enough body fat to survive the winter. Without it, they would either starve or not have enough energy to successfully produce offspring. But when you eat mostly plants, it's hard to gain a lot of weight. You need to be a highly effective forager. So, bears tightly follow the schedule of the plants and harvest them like crops at the point in time when they are at the most nutritious. This will happen in different places at different times. In autumn, a large male grizzly can eat up to 200,000 berries in a single day. Therefore, to protect these bears, researchers want to take a closer look at the seasonal interaction between grizzlies and plants to identify areas of the highest quality habitat. This begins 700 kilometers up in space. Up here, two NASA satellites carry sensors that are sensitive to the light reflected by vegetation. Every species of plant reflects a unique combination of wave lengths, called spectral signatures that act like different chords on a piano but use light instead of sound. These signatures are recorded by the satellites every day and are combined like frames in a movie so you can watch the vegetation grow over an entire summer. Simultaneously, the movements of bears wearing GPS collars are monitored to see how they respond to the ebb and flow of nutrition throughout their habitat. Now, instead of ordinary, static habitat maps, these dynamic, time-lapse habitat maps could be used for grizzly bear conservation in a number of ways. First, they help calculate the carrying capacity of the study area. In other words, how many bears can the remaining habitat support? Is there enough food to go around? Second, the maps show where bears will be foraging at specific times. We can prevent disturbing the bears and stressing them out by avoiding these areas during important feeding periods. Finally, the maps can be used to predict the effects of climate change, where shifting annual temperatures will alter the rate of plant growth, throwing the bears' precise foraging schedule out of whack. This provides less food and increases competition between bears. Grizzlies are charismatic symbols of the wilderness. These habitat maps made from satellite imagery can not only help conserve grizzly bears but all sorts of different species. They aid us in understanding how ecosystems function, where they are threatened, and how we can try to keep our fragile, amazing planet intact.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: Why do grizzly bears need to hibernate during the winter? 

Although the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question intent is similar. The ground truth MCQ asks what an animal that eats plants does when winter comes and there's nothing to eat, and the correct answer is that they either migrate or hibernate. Question 2 asks why grizzly bears need to hibernate during the winter, and the correct answer (not provided) would be related to the lack of food during the winter.

However, a more similar question is not present in the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would choose Question 2, but I would like to note that the similarity is not very high.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby These are grizzly bears. As you can see, they have big teeth and giant claws. But once you get to know them better, they're not as ferocious as you might think. They play a critical role in the function of our ecosystems, but, unfortunately, their habitat is dwindling fast. In order to protect them, it's important to know why do grizzlies choose certain areas to inhabit in the first place? Let's look at a threatened population of bears living in the rocky mountains of Canada. Remember those giant claws? Well, they're not for what you might think. They have evolved specifically for digging up energy-rich roots. It turns out that grizzlies eat a lot of plants. The ones that live here are almost vegetarians. You see, unlike other predators, grizzlies have diverse diets that can include up to 90% vegetation. However, maintaining a diet of plants can be difficult. In these northern latitudes, you have distinct seasons where it's really nice and green for part of the year and really cold for the other part. If you eat plants, you have almost nothing to eat for the cold part of the year. So, you either have to migrate like geese or hibernate like ground squirrels. Grizzly bears hibernate. Their behaviors are closely synchronized with the seasons. During the summer, they have to pack on enough body fat to survive the winter. Without it, they would either starve or not have enough energy to successfully produce offspring. But when you eat mostly plants, it's hard to gain a lot of weight. You need to be a highly effective forager. So, bears tightly follow the schedule of the plants and harvest them like crops at the point in time when they are at the most nutritious. This will happen in different places at different times. In autumn, a large male grizzly can eat up to 200,000 berries in a single day. Therefore, to protect these bears, researchers want to take a closer look at the seasonal interaction between grizzlies and plants to identify areas of the highest quality habitat. This begins 700 kilometers up in space. Up here, two NASA satellites carry sensors that are sensitive to the light reflected by vegetation. Every species of plant reflects a unique combination of wave lengths, called spectral signatures that act like different chords on a piano but use light instead of sound. These signatures are recorded by the satellites every day and are combined like frames in a movie so you can watch the vegetation grow over an entire summer. Simultaneously, the movements of bears wearing GPS collars are monitored to see how they respond to the ebb and flow of nutrition throughout their habitat. Now, instead of ordinary, static habitat maps, these dynamic, time-lapse habitat maps could be used for grizzly bear conservation in a number of ways. First, they help calculate the carrying capacity of the study area. In other words, how many bears can the remaining habitat support? Is there enough food to go around? Second, the maps show where bears will be foraging at specific times. We can prevent disturbing the bears and stressing them out by avoiding these areas during important feeding periods. Finally, the maps can be used to predict the effects of climate change, where shifting annual temperatures will alter the rate of plant growth, throwing the bears' precise foraging schedule out of whack. This provides less food and increases competition between bears. Grizzlies are charismatic symbols of the wilderness. These habitat maps made from satellite imagery can not only help conserve grizzly bears but all sorts of different species. They aid us in understanding how ecosystems function, where they are threatened, and how we can try to keep our fragile, amazing planet intact.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the purpose of grizzly bears' long claws, and the correct answer is "digging." 

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the information provided in the transcript, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match. It talks about the unique way grizzly bears eat plants, mentioning that they "tightly follow the schedule of the plants and harvest them like crops at the point in time when they are at the most nutritious." This question is related to the fact that grizzly bears have evolved long claws for digging up energy-rich roots, but it does not directly ask about the purpose of their claws.

Therefore, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 7, but please note that it is not a direct match.

gotcha mosquitoes I hate them don't you that awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives me absolutely crazy knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood that's awful right in fact there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes when they fly into our bedroom at night they prefer to bite my wife but that's fascinating right why does she receive more bites than I do and the answer is smell the smell of our body and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitoes some of us are just more attractive than others so my wife smells nicer than I do or I just stink more than she does either way either way mosquitoes find us in the dark by sniffing us out they smell us and during my PhD I wanted to know exactly what chemicals from our skin mosquitoes used African malaria mosquitoes use to track us down at night there's a whole range of compounds that they do use and this was not going to be an easy task and therefore we set up various experiments why did we set up these experiments because half the world's population runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria through a simple mosquito bite every 30 seconds somewhere on this planet a child dies of malaria and Paula levy this morning he was talking about the metaphor of the 77 crashing in the United States well in Africa we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 747 crashing every day perhaps if we can attract these mosquitoes to traps bait it with our smell we may be able to stop transmission of disease now solving this puzzle was not an easy thing because we produced hundreds of difference of chemicals on the skin but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed first we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body strange so we set up an experiment whereby we put a naked volunteer in a large cage and in that case we release mosquitoes to see where they were biting on the body of that person and we found some remarkable differences on the left here you see the bites by the Dutch malaria mosquito on this person there's a very strong preference for biting on the face in contrast the African malaria mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person and that of course we should have known all along because they're called mosquitoes you see that's right and so and so we started focusing on the smell of feet on the smell of human feet until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse think of it and this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment we tried with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese which smells badly after feet to attract African malaria mosquitoes and you know what it worked in fact it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that were using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be 2 to 3 times more attractive to mosquitoes than humans Limburg be proud of your cheese as it is now used in the fight against malaria that's the cheese just to show you my second story it's remarkable as well it's about man's best friend it's about dogs and I will show you how we can use dogs and the fight against malaria one of the best ways of killing mosquitoes is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmitted disease it's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae why because they're just like the CIA in that pool of water these larvae are concentrated they're all together there they are in mobile they can't escape from the water they can't fly and and they're accessible you can actually walk up to that tool and you can kill them there right so the problem that we face with this is that throughout the landscape all these pools are falta with a larvae they're scattered all over the place which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides the last year we thought very very hard how can we resolve this problem until we realized that just like us we have unique smell that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell and so we set up another crazy experiment because we collected the smell of these larvae put it on pieces of cloth and then did something very remarkable here we have a bar with four holes and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole whoo that was very quick and then you see the dog it's called tweet it's a border collie he's examining these holes and now he's got it all ready he's going back to check the control holes again but he's coming back to the first one and now he's locking into that smell which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitoes in the field and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria this lady is Alan from Goss wave she's one of the best dog trainers in the world and she believes that we can do a lot more since we also know that people that carry malaria parasite smell different compared to people that are uninfected she's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite that means that in the population where malaria has gone down all the way and there's food few people remaining with parasites that the dogs can find these people we can treat them with anti malarial drugs and give a final blow to malaria man's best friend in the fight against malaria my third story is perhaps even more remarkable and I should say has never been shown to the public until today yeah it's a crazy story but I believe it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge against mosquitoes ever in fact people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes and the question of course is what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes and the answer I have right here in my pocket if I get it it's a tongueless simple tablet and when I take it with water it does miracles thank you now let me show you how this works here in this box I have a cage there's several hundred hungry female mosquitoes that I'm just about to release just kidding just kidding what I'm going to show you is I'm gonna stick my arm into it and I will show you how quickly they will bite there we go don't worry I do this all the time in the lab there we go okay now on the video on the video here I'm gonna show you exactly the same thing except that what I'm showing you in the video happened one hour after I took the tablet have a look that doesn't work okay sorry about that I'm sticky getting my arm I'm giving them a big juicy blunt meal I'm shaking them off and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very very sick indeed here shown in fast motion and three hours later what we see on the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitoes very dead mosquitoes and I'm going to say ladies and gentlemen we have swapped the cards with mosquitoes they don't kill us we kill them now Maslak vp prayers now think of what we can do with this we can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases of epidemics right and better still imagine what would happen if in a very large area everyone would take this drugs this drug for just three weeks that would gives an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease so cheese dorks and a pill to kill mosquitoes that's the kind of out-of-the-box science that I love doing for the betterment of mankind but especially for her so that she can grow up in the world without malaria thank you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of malaria and its impact.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of children who die each hour from malaria. While there isn't a direct match, I found that Question 9: "What would happen if everyone in a large area took the tablet for three weeks?" is related to the topic of malaria and its potential elimination.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent, I would suggest Question 8: "What is the potential use of the tablet in containing outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases?" This question is related to the topic of malaria and its control, although it doesn't directly ask about the number of children who die from the disease.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that specifically asks about the number of children who die from malaria each hour would be a more accurate match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 8 (with the caveat that it's not a direct match)

United States well in Africa we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 747 crashing every day perhaps if we can attract these mosquitoes to traps bait it with our smell we may be able to stop transmission of disease now solving this puzzle was not an easy thing because we produced hundreds of difference of chemicals on the skin but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed first we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body strange so we set up an experiment whereby we put a naked volunteer in a large cage and in that case we release mosquitoes to see where they were biting on the body of that person and we found some remarkable differences on the left here you see the bites by the Dutch malaria mosquito on this person there's a very strong preference for biting on the face in contrast the African malaria mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person and that of course we should have known all along because they're called mosquitoes you see that's right and so and so we started focusing on the smell of feet on the smell of human feet until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse think of it and this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment we tried with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese which smells badly after feet to attract African malaria mosquitoes and you know what it worked in fact it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that were using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be 2 to 3 times more attractive to mosquitoes than humans Limburg be proud of your cheese as it is now used in the fight against malaria that's the cheese just to show you my second story it's remarkable as well it's about man's best friend it's about dogs and I will show you how we can use dogs and the fight against malaria one of the best ways of killing mosquitoes is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmitted disease it's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae why because they're just like the CIA in that pool of water these larvae are concentrated they're all together there they are in mobile they can't escape from the water they can't fly and and they're accessible you can actually walk up to that tool and you can kill them there right so the problem that we face with this is that throughout the landscape all these pools are falta with a larvae they're scattered all over the place which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides the last year we thought very very hard how can we resolve this problem until we realized that just like us we have unique smell that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell and so we set up another crazy experiment because we collected the smell of these larvae put it on pieces of cloth and then did something very remarkable here we have a bar with four holes and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole whoo that was very quick and then you see the dog it's called tweet it's a border collie he's examining these holes and now he's got it all ready he's going back to check the control holes again but he's coming back to the first one and now he's locking into that smell which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitoes in the field and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria this lady is Alan from Goss wave she's one of the best dog trainers in the world and she believes that we can do a lot more since we also know that people that carry malaria parasite smell different compared to people that are uninfected she's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite that means that in the population where malaria has gone down all the way and there's food few people remaining with parasites that the dogs can find these people we can treat them with anti malarial drugs and give a final blow to malaria man's best friend in the fight against malaria my third story is perhaps even more remarkable and I should say has never been shown to the public until today yeah it's a crazy story but I believe it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge against mosquitoes ever in fact people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes and the question of course is what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes and the answer I have right here in my pocket if I get it it's a tongueless simple tablet and when I take it with water it does miracles thank you now let me show you how this works here in this box I have a cage there's several hundred hungry female mosquitoes that I'm just about to release just kidding just kidding what I'm going to show you is I'm gonna stick my arm into it and I will show you how quickly they will bite there we go don't worry I do this all the time in the lab there we go okay now on the video on the video here I'm gonna show you exactly the same thing except that what I'm showing you in the video happened one hour after I took the tablet have a look that doesn't work okay sorry about that I'm sticky getting my arm I'm giving them a big juicy blunt meal I'm shaking them off and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very very sick indeed here shown in fast motion and three hours later what we see on the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitoes very dead mosquitoes and I'm going to say ladies and gentlemen we have swapped the cards with mosquitoes they don't kill us we kill them now Maslak vp prayers now think of what we can do with this we can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases of epidemics right and better still imagine what would happen if in a very large area everyone would take this drugs this drug for just three weeks that would gives an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease so cheese dorks and a pill to kill mosquitoes that's the kind of out-of-the-box science that I love doing for the betterment of mankind but especially for her so that she can grow up in the world without malaria thank you

gotcha mosquitoes I hate them don't you that awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives me absolutely crazy knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood that's awful right in fact there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes when they fly into our bedroom at night they prefer to bite my wife but that's fascinating right why does she receive more bites than I do and the answer is smell the smell of our body and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitoes some of us are just more attractive than others so my wife smells nicer than I do or I just stink more than she does either way either way mosquitoes find us in the dark by sniffing us out they smell us and

I always wanted to become a walking on the bar to a social engagement to to resonate other people's feelings thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them as a scientist I always wanted to measure that residence that sense of the other that happened so quickly in a blink of an eye when to its have the people's feelings we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen we're always in the stands of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity we do that all the time we just can't shake it off it's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves to understand the world around them is shaped by that test we are we are social to the core so my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long state hospitals this is a long time ago and for them autism was devastating they had profound intellectual disabilities they didn't talk but most of all they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them from their environment and from the people in fact at the time if you walked into a school for individuals of autism you hear a lot of noise plenty of commotion actions people doing things but they're always doing things by themselves so they may be looking at the light in the ceiling or they may be isolated in the corner or they might be engaged in this repetitive movements in self-stimulatory movements that let them know we're extremely extremely isolated well now we know that autism is this disruption the disruption of this resonance that I'm telling you these are survival skills these are survival skills that we inherited over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of other fragility without the caregiver they wouldn't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with this mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver from the first days and weeks of life babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as they looking at people they look at people's eyes because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away well they oriented the caregiver they can't give a 6 to baby and is out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind the social mind the social brain the panel we always think about autism as as something that happens later on in life it doesn't it begins at the beginning of life as babies engage with caregivers they soon realize that um well there is something in between the ears that is very important is invisible you can't see that is really critical and that thing is called attention and they learn soon enough even before they can utter one word that it can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want they also learn to follow other people's gaze because whatever people are looking at is what they're thinking about and soon enough they start to learn about the meaning of things because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something then I'm just getting a directional cue they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing the attitude and soon enough they start building this body of meanings but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction those are meanings that are acquired as part of their share experiences with others well this is a little 50 month old little girl and she has autism and I am coming so close to her that I'm maybe 2 inches from her face and she's quite oblivious to me imagine if I did that to you and I came 2 inches from your face you do probably two things wouldn't you you would recoil you call the police you do something because it's virtually impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get that reaction we do so remember intuitively effortlessly this is our body wisdom is not something that is mediated by a language our body just knows that and we've known that for a long time and this is not something that happens to humans only it happens to some of our palliative cousins because if you're a monkey and you look at another monkey and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal threat well you are not going to be alive for long so something that in other species our survival mechanisms without them they wouldn't they wouldn't basically live we bring into the context of human beings and this is what we need to simply act act socially now she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her and you think hell maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you well a few minutes later she goes to the corner of the room and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an M&M so I could not attract her attention but something a thing did now most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people now for this girl that division line is not so clear and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences now what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating himself further and further so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic the brain determines we were going to be but in fact the brain also becomes we are and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction this is what's happening with their mind and this is what's happening with a brain well autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders and it's a brain disorder is a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born we now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted now those individuals who don't talk at all there are those individuals who talk too much there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school you see them running the periphery fence of the school day if you let them to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage repeatedly relentlessly but often in an awkward fashion without that immediate resonance well this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time when I started in this field we thought that they were for individuals of autism for 10,000 a very rare condition well now we now it's more like 1 in 100 there are millions of individuals of autism all around the societal cost of this condition is huge in the US alone maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars and you know what most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled individuals who need wraparound services services that are very very intensive and those services can cost in excess of 60 to $80,000 a year those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment because now we know that what doesn't create itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you were we to be able to identify this condition that at earlier point and intervene and treat I can tell you and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past ten years this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition also we have a window of opportunity because the brain is malleable for just so long and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life it's not that that window closes it doesn't but it diminishes considerably and yet the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years and in disadvantaged populations the populations that don't have access to clinical services rural populations minorities the age of diagnosis is later still which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals of autism whose condition is going to be more severe so I feel that we have a bio ethical imperative the science is there but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact you see and we just can't afford that missed opportunity because children reporters and become adults with autism and we feel that those things that we can do for these children for those families early on will have lifetime consequences for the child for the family and for the community at large so this is our view of autism there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe that there going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism and genetic anomaly is much more than just genes and we actually have a bit of a question here because if there are so many different causes of autism how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome because people like myself when we walk into a play room we recognize the child does have a autism so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity and the answer is what lies in between which is development and in fact we are very interested in those first two years of life because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism autism creates itself where we to be able to intervene during those years of life we might attenuate person and God knows maybe even prevent for others so how do we do that how do we enter that feeling of resonance how do we enter another person's being I remember when I interacted with that 50 month older that the things that came to my mind was how do you how do you come into her world is she thinking about me is she thinking about that'ss well um it's hard to do that so we had to create the technologies we had to basically step inside a body we had to see the world through her eyes and so in the past many years we've been sort of building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with well this is my colleague Warren Jones with whom we've been building this methods the studies for the past 12 years and you see there I'm happy five-month older it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world his mom the caregiver but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his in his day care what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that we had to create this very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies how newborns engage with the world moment by moment what is important and what is not well we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention you're watching a video those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds and we freeze one frame and this is what the typical children are doing in this scan pass in green here are two-year-olds of autism so on that frame the children who are typical are watching this the emotional expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl what are the children of autism doing they are focusing on the revolving door opening and shutting well I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen all in our 5-minute experiments it happens moment by moment in the real lives and their minds are being formed and our brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with the typical peers well we took a construct from our pediatrician friends the concept of growth charts you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and so you have physical height and weight what we decided they were going to create growth charts of social engagement and we saw children from the time that they are born and what you see here on the x-axis is 2 3 4 5 6 months and 9 until about the age of 24 months and this is the percent of their viewing time that they're focusing on people's eyes and this is their growth chart they start over here they love people's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months now let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic it's something very different it starts way up here but that it's a freefall it's very much like they brought into this world a reflex that Orient's them to people but he has no traction it's almost as if that stimulus you you are not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives now we we thought that those data were were so powerful in a way that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life because if you will in turn if you interact with a two and a three month older you be surprised by how social those babies are and what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily and using this kinds of measures and many others what we found out is that our science could in fact identify this condition early on we didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge and the second year of life if we measure things that are evolutionarily highly conserved and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months and that's what we are doing now now we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community now we want those devices of course to be deployed by those who are in the trenches our colleagues the primary care physicians who see every child and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice because they have to see so many children and we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention for treatment we need to be able to work with the families to support the families to manage those first years with them we need to be able to really go from Universal screening to universal access to treatment because those treatments are going to change this children's in those families lives now when we think about what we can't do in those first years I I can tell you having been in this field for so long one feels really rejuvenated there is a sense that the science the one worked on can actually have an impact on reality's preventing in fact those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition no longer we can do a great deal of things and the idea is not to cure autism that's not the idea what we want is to make sure that those individuals of autism can be free from the devastating consequences the comma beta times the profound intellectual disabilities the lack of language the profound profound isolation we feel the individuals of autism in fact have a very special perspective on the world and we need diversity and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength predictable situations situations that can be defined because after all they learn about the world almost like about it rather than learning how to function in it but this is a strength if you're working for example in technology and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities we want them to be free of that we want the next generations of individuals of autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise well

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: What is the significance of the speaker's interaction with the 50-month-old girl with autism?**

Although the question itself does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, one of the options (C) mentions the difficulty of penetrating someone's physical space without their consent, which is related to the idea of the noise at a school for individuals with autism being an accumulation of isolated, individual sounds.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, I can suggest an alternative approach to create a more similar MCQ.

If I were to create a new MCQ based on the ground truth MCQ, I would rephrase it as follows:

**New Question: What was notable about the environment at a school for individuals with autism?**
Options: A. The noise was primarily from group conversations, B. The noise came from an accumulation of isolated, individual sounds, C. The environment was extremely quiet, D. The environment was identical to a typical school setting.

This new question more closely matches the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ.

Since I couldn't find a direct match among the generated MCQs, I will provide the index of the question that I found to be the most similar, albeit not a perfect match:

**Index: 3**

Please note that this is an approximation, and a more accurate match would require creating a new MCQ that directly addresses the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
I always wanted to become a walking on the bar to a social engagement to to resonate other people's feelings thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them as a scientist I always wanted to measure that residence that sense of the other that happened so quickly in a blink of an eye when to its have the people's feelings we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen we're always in the stands of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity we do that all the time we just can't shake it off it's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves to understand the world around them is shaped by that test we are we are social to the core so my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long state hospitals this is a long time ago and for them autism was devastating they had profound intellectual disabilities they didn't talk but most of all they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them from their environment and from the people in fact at the time if you walked into a school for individuals of autism you hear a lot of noise plenty of commotion actions people doing things but they're always doing things by themselves so they may be looking at the light in the ceiling or they may be isolated in the corner or they might be engaged in this repetitive movements in self-stimulatory movements that let them know we're extremely extremely isolated well now we know that autism is this disruption the disruption of this resonance that I'm telling you these are survival skills these are survival skills that we inherited over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of other fragility without the caregiver they wouldn't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with this mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver from the first days and weeks of life babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as they looking at people they look at people's eyes because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, I must note that Question 3 does not directly address the concept of babies learning about the world by following their caregivers' gaze. Instead, it discusses the speaker's interaction with a 50-month-old girl with autism.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ would be one that directly addresses the concept of babies learning about the world by following their caregivers' gaze. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 6 is a distant second, as it discusses the "funnel of attention" and the divergence in attention between typical and autistic children. However, this question does not directly address the concept of babies learning about the world by following their caregivers' gaze.

Therefore, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that directly addresses the concept of babies learning about the world by following their caregivers' gaze.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but with a low confidence score.

Index: 3 (with low confidence)

**Transcript**:
I always wanted to become a walking on the bar to a social engagement to to resonate other people's feelings thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them as a scientist I always wanted to measure that residence that sense of the other that happened so quickly in a blink of an eye when to its have the people's feelings we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen we're always in the stands of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity we do that all the time we just can't shake it off it's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves to understand the world around them is shaped by that test we are we are social to the core so my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long state hospitals this is a long time ago and for them autism was devastating they had profound intellectual disabilities they didn't talk but most of all they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them from their environment and from the people in fact at the time if you walked into a school for individuals of autism you hear a lot of noise plenty of commotion actions people doing things but they're always doing things by themselves so they may be looking at the light in the ceiling or they may be isolated in the corner or they might be engaged in this repetitive movements in self-stimulatory movements that let them know we're extremely extremely isolated well now we know that autism is this disruption the disruption of this resonance that I'm telling you these are survival skills these are survival skills that we inherited over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of other fragility without the caregiver they wouldn't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with this mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver from the first days and weeks of life babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as they looking at people they look at people's eyes because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away well they oriented the caregiver they can't give a 6 to baby and is out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind the social mind the social brain the panel we always think about autism as as something that happens later on in life it doesn't it begins at the beginning of life as babies engage with caregivers they soon realize that um well there is something in between the ears that is very important is invisible you can't see that is really critical and that thing is called attention and they learn soon enough even before they can utter one word that it can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want they also learn to follow other people's gaze because whatever people are looking at is what they're thinking about and soon enough they start to learn about the meaning of things because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something then I'm just getting a directional cue they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing the attitude and soon enough they start building this body of meanings but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction those are meanings that are acquired as part of their share experiences with others well this is a little 50 month old little girl and she has autism and I am coming so close to her that I'm maybe 2 inches from her face and she's quite oblivious to me imagine if I did that to you and I came 2 inches from your face you do probably two things wouldn't you you would recoil you call the police you do something because it's virtually impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get that reaction we do so remember intuitively effortlessly this is our body wisdom is not something that is mediated by a language our body just knows that and we've known that for a long time and this is not something that happens to humans only it happens to some of our palliative cousins because if you're a monkey and you look at another monkey and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal threat well you are not going to be alive for long so something that in other species our survival mechanisms without them they wouldn't they wouldn't basically live we bring into the context of human beings and this is what we need to simply act act socially now she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her and you think hell maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you well a few minutes later she goes to the corner of the room and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an M&M so I could not attract her attention but something a thing did now most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people now for this girl that division line is not so clear and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences now what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating himself further and further so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic the brain determines we were going to be but in fact the brain also becomes we are and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction this is what's happening with their mind and this is what's happening with a brain well autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders and it's a brain disorder is a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born we now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted now those individuals who don't talk at all there are those individuals who talk too much there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school you see them running the periphery fence of the school day if you let them to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage repeatedly relentlessly but often in an awkward fashion without that immediate resonance well this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time when I started in this field we thought that they were for individuals of autism for 10,000 a very rare condition well now we now it's more like 1 in 100 there are millions of individuals of autism all around the societal cost of this condition is huge in the US alone maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars and you know what most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled individuals who need wraparound services services that are very very intensive and those services can cost in excess of 60 to $80,000 a year those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment because now we know that what doesn't create itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you were we to be able to identify this condition that at earlier point and intervene and treat I can tell you and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past ten years this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition also we have a window of opportunity because the brain is malleable for just so long and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life it's not that that window closes it doesn't but it diminishes considerably and yet the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years and in disadvantaged populations the populations that don't have access to clinical services rural populations minorities the age of diagnosis is later still which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals of autism whose condition is going to be more severe so I feel that we have a bio ethical imperative the science is there but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact you see and we just can't afford that missed opportunity because children reporters and become adults with autism and we feel that those things that we can do for these children for those families early on will have lifetime consequences for the child for the family and for the community at large so this is our view of autism there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe that there going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism and genetic anomaly is much more than just genes and we actually have a bit of a question here because if there are so many different causes of autism how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome because people like myself when we walk into a play room we recognize the child does have a autism so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity and the answer is what lies in between which is development and in fact we are very interested in those first two years of life because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism autism creates itself where we to be able to intervene during those years of life we might attenuate person and God knows maybe even prevent for others so how do we do that how do we enter that feeling of resonance how do we enter another person's being I remember when I interacted with that 50 month older that the things that came to my mind was how do you how do you come into her world is she thinking about me is she thinking about that'ss well um it's hard to do that so we had to create the technologies we had to basically step inside a body we had to see the world through her eyes and so in the past many years we've been sort of building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with well this is my colleague Warren Jones with whom we've been building this methods the studies for the past 12 years and you see there I'm happy five-month older it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world his mom the caregiver but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his in his day care what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that we had to create this very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies how newborns engage with the world moment by moment what is important and what is not well we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention you're watching a video those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds and we freeze one frame and this is what the typical children are doing in this scan pass in green here are two-year-olds of autism so on that frame the children who are typical are watching this the emotional expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl what are the children of autism doing they are focusing on the revolving door opening and shutting well I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen all in our 5-minute experiments it happens moment by moment in the real lives and their minds are being formed and our brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with the typical peers well we took a construct from our pediatrician friends the concept of growth charts you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and so you have physical height and weight what we decided they were going to create growth charts of social engagement and we saw children from the time that they are born and what you see here on the x-axis is 2 3 4 5 6 months and 9 until about the age of 24 months and this is the percent of their viewing time that they're focusing on people's eyes and this is their growth chart they start over here they love people's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months now let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic it's something very different it starts way up here but that it's a freefall it's very much like they brought into this world a reflex that Orient's them to people but he has no traction it's almost as if that stimulus you you are not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives now we we thought that those data were were so powerful in a way that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life because if you will in turn if you interact with a two and a three month older you be surprised by how social those babies are and what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily and using this kinds of measures and many others what we found out is that our science could in fact identify this condition early on we didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge and the second year of life if we measure things that are evolutionarily highly conserved and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months and that's what we are doing now now we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community now we want those devices of course to be deployed by those who are in the trenches our colleagues the primary care physicians who see every child and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice because they have to see so many children and we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention for treatment we need to be able to work with the families to support the families to manage those first years with them we need to be able to really go from Universal screening to universal access to treatment because those treatments are going to change this children's in those families lives now when we think about what we can't do in those first years I I can tell you having been in this field for so long one feels really rejuvenated there is a sense that the science the one worked on can actually have an impact on reality's preventing in fact those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition no longer we can do a great deal of things and the idea is not to cure autism that's not the idea what we want is to make sure that those individuals of autism can be free from the devastating consequences the comma beta times the profound intellectual disabilities the lack of language the profound profound isolation we feel the individuals of autism in fact have a very special perspective on the world and we need diversity and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength predictable situations situations that can be defined because after all they learn about the world almost like about it rather than learning how to function in it but this is a strength if you're working for example in technology and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities we want them to be free of that we want the next generations of individuals of autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise well

in this scan pass in green here are two-year-olds of autism so on that frame the children who are typical are watching this the emotional expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl what are the children of autism doing they are focusing on the revolving door opening and shutting well I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen all in our 5-minute experiments it happens moment by moment in the real lives and their minds are being formed and our brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with the typical peers well we took a construct from our pediatrician friends the concept of growth charts you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and so you have physical height and weight what we decided they were going to create growth charts of social engagement and we saw children from the time that they are born and what you see here on the x-axis is 2 3 4 5 6 months and 9 until about the age of 24 months and this is the percent of their viewing time that they're focusing on people's eyes and this is their growth chart they start over here they love people's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months now let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic it's something very different it starts way up here but that it's a freefall it's very much like they brought into this world a reflex that Orient's them to people but he has no traction it's almost as if that stimulus you you are not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives now we we thought that those data were were so powerful in a way that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life because if you will in turn if you interact with a two and a three month older you be surprised by how social those babies are and what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily and using this kinds of measures and many others what we found out is that our science could in fact identify this condition early on we didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge and the second year of life if we measure things that are evolutionarily highly conserved and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months and that's what we are doing now now we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community now we want those devices of course to be deployed by those who are in the trenches our colleagues the primary care physicians who see every child and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice because they have to see so many children and we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention for treatment we need to be able to work with the families to support the families to manage those first years with them we need to be able to really go from Universal screening to universal access to treatment because those treatments are going to change this children's in those families lives now when we think about what we can't do in those first years I I can tell you having been in this field for so long one feels really rejuvenated there is a sense that the science the one worked on can actually have an impact on reality's preventing in fact those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition no longer we can do a great deal of things and the idea is not to cure autism that's not the idea what we want is to make sure that those individuals of autism can be free from the devastating consequences the comma beta times the profound intellectual disabilities the lack of language the profound profound isolation we feel the individuals of autism in fact have a very special perspective on the world and we need diversity and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength predictable situations situations that can be defined because after all they learn about the world almost like about it rather than learning how to function in it but this is a strength if you're working for example in technology and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities we want them to be free of that we want the next generations of individuals of autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise well

**Transcript**:
I always wanted to become a walking on the bar to a social engagement to to resonate other people's feelings thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them as a scientist I always wanted to measure that residence that sense of the other that happened so quickly in a blink of an eye when to its have the people's feelings we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen we're always in the stands of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity we do that all the time we just can't shake it off it's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves to understand the world around them is shaped by that test we are we are social to the core so my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long state hospitals this is a long time ago and for them autism was devastating they had profound intellectual disabilities they didn't talk but most of all they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them from their environment and from the people in fact at the time if you walked into a school for individuals of autism you hear a lot of noise plenty of commotion actions people doing things but they're always doing things by themselves so they may be looking at the light in the ceiling or they may be isolated in the corner or they might be engaged in this repetitive movements in self-stimulatory movements that let them know we're extremely extremely isolated well now we know that autism is this disruption the disruption of this resonance that I'm telling you these are survival skills these are survival skills that we inherited over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of other fragility without the caregiver they wouldn't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with this mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver from the first days and weeks of life babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as they looking at people they look at people's eyes because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away well they oriented the caregiver they can't give a 6 to baby and is out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind the social mind the social brain the panel we always think about autism as as something that happens later on in life it doesn't it begins at the beginning of life as babies engage with caregivers they soon realize that um well there is something in between the ears that is very important is invisible you can't see that is really critical and that thing is called attention and they learn soon enough even before they can utter one word that it can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want they also learn to follow other people's gaze because whatever people are looking at is what they're thinking about and soon enough they start to learn about the meaning of things because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something then I'm just getting a directional cue they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing the attitude and soon enough they start building this body of meanings but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction those are meanings that are acquired as part of their share experiences with others well this is a little 50 month old little girl and she has autism and I am coming so close to her that I'm maybe 2 inches from her face and she's quite oblivious to me imagine if I did that to you and I came 2 inches from your face you do probably two things wouldn't you you would recoil you call the police you do something because it's virtually impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get that reaction we do so remember intuitively effortlessly this is our body wisdom is not something that is mediated by a language our body just knows that and we've known that for a long time and this is not something that happens to humans only it happens to some of our palliative cousins because if you're a monkey and you look at another monkey and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal threat well you are not going to be alive for long so something that in other species our survival mechanisms without them they wouldn't they wouldn't basically live we bring into the context of human beings and this is what we need to simply act act socially now she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her and you think hell maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you well a few minutes later she goes to the corner of the room and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an M&M so I could not attract her attention but something a thing did now most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people now for this girl that division line is not so clear and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences now what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating himself further and further so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic the brain determines we were going to be but in fact the brain also becomes we are and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction this is what's happening with their mind and this is what's happening with a brain well autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders and it's a brain disorder is a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born we now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted now those individuals who don't talk at all there are those individuals who talk too much there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school you see them running the periphery fence of the school day if you let them to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage repeatedly relentlessly but often in an awkward fashion without that immediate resonance well this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time when I started in this field we thought that they were for individuals of autism for 10,000 a very rare condition well now we now it's more like 1 in 100 there are millions of individuals of autism all around the societal cost of this condition is huge in the US alone maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars and you know what most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled individuals who need wraparound services services that are very very intensive and those services can cost in excess of 60 to $80,000 a year those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment because now we know that what doesn't create itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you were we to be able to identify this condition that at earlier point and intervene and treat I can tell you and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past ten years this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition also we have a window of opportunity because the brain is malleable for just so long and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life it's not that that window closes it doesn't but it diminishes considerably and yet the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years and in disadvantaged populations the populations that don't have access to clinical services rural populations minorities the age of diagnosis is later still which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals of autism whose condition is going to be more severe so I feel that we have a bio ethical imperative the science is there but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact you see and we just can't afford that missed opportunity because children reporters and become adults with autism and we feel that those things that we can do for these children for those families early on will have lifetime consequences for the child for the family and for the community at large so this is our view of autism there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe that there going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism and genetic anomaly is much more than just genes and we actually have a bit of a question here because if there are so many different causes of autism how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome because people like myself when we walk into a play room we recognize the child does have a autism so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity and the answer is what lies in between which is development and in fact we are very interested in those first two years of life because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism autism creates itself where we to be able to intervene during those years of life we might attenuate person and God knows maybe even prevent for others so how do we do that how do we enter that feeling of resonance how do we enter another person's being I remember when I interacted with that 50 month older that the things that came to my mind was how do you how do you come into her world is she thinking about me is she thinking about that'ss well um it's hard to do that so we had to create the technologies we had to basically step inside a body we had to see the world through her eyes and so in the past many years we've been sort of building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with well this is my colleague Warren Jones with whom we've been building this methods the studies for the past 12 years and you see there I'm happy five-month older it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world his mom the caregiver but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his in his day care what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that we had to create this very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies how newborns engage with the world moment by moment what is important and what is not well we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention you're watching a video those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds and we freeze one frame and this is what the typical children are doing in this scan pass in green here are two-year-olds of autism so on that frame the children who are typical are watching this the emotional expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl what are the children of autism doing they are focusing on the revolving door opening and shutting well I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen all in our 5-minute experiments it happens moment by moment in the real lives and their minds are being formed and our brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with the typical peers well we took a construct from our pediatrician friends the concept of growth charts you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and so you have physical height and weight what we decided they were going to create growth charts of social engagement and we saw children from the time that they are born and what you see here on the x-axis is 2 3 4 5 6 months and 9 until about the age of 24 months and this is the percent of their viewing time that they're focusing on people's eyes and this is their growth chart they start over here they love people's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months now let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic it's something very different it starts way up here but that it's a

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] 15 years ago it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life back then 15 years ago we didn't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and Development Across the lifespan in the past decade or so mainly due to advances in brain imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging or MRI neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages and to track changes in brain structure and brain function so we use structural MRI if you like to take a snapshot a photograph at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain and we can ask questions like how much gray matter does does the brain contain and how does that change with age and we also use functional MRI called fmri to take a video a movie of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something so many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development but by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood and instead the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the 20s and 30s so adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological hormonal physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable independent role in society it can go on a long time one of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex so this is uh this is a model of the human brain and this is prefrontal cortex right at the front prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area it's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions things like decisionmaking planning planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year inhibiting inappropriate behav Behavior so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid it's also involved in social interaction understanding other people and self-awareness so MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence so if you look at gry matter volume for example gry matter volume across age from Age 4 to 22 years increases during childhood which is what you can see on this graph it PE peaks in early adolescence the arrows indicate Peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex you can see that that Peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls and that's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average and then during adolescence there's a significant decline in gry matter volume in prefrontal cortex now that might sound bad but actually this is a really important developmental process because gray matter contains cell bodies and connections between cells the copses and this decline in gry matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning the elimination of unwanted synapses this is a really important process it's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in in that synapses that are being used are strengthened and copses that aren't being used in that particular environment are pruned away you can think of it a bit like pruning a rose bush you prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining important branches can grow stronger and this process which effectively fine tunes brain tissue according to the species specific environment is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions During the period of human adolesence so a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the Adolescent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age so I'll just give you an example from my lab so my lab we're interested in the social brain that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people so I like to show a a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work so this is a soccer game Michael Owen has just missed a goal and he's lying on the ground and the first aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic and instinctive social emotional responses are so within a split second of Mich Owen missing this goal everyone is doing the same thing with their arms and the same thing with their face even mik Owen as he slides along the grass is doing the same thing with his arms and presumably has a similar facial expression and the only people who don't are the guys in yellow at the back and I I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium and they're doing another social emotional response that we all instantly recognize and that's the second aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates how good we are at reading other people Behavior their actions their gestures their facial expressions in terms of their underlying emotions and mental States so you don't have to ask any of these guys you have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling and thinking at this precise moment in time so that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab so we in my lab we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people their minds their mental States their emotions and one of the findings that we've found several times now as have other labs around the world is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex which is shown in Blue on the slide and it's um right in the middle of prefrontal Cortex in the in the midline of your head this region is more active in adolescence when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults and this is actually a metaanalysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world and they all show the same thing that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decre increases during the period of adolescence and we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach a different cognitive strategy to make social decisions and one way of looking at that is to do Behavioral Studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of Behavioral task and I'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab so imagine that you're the participant in one of our experiments you come to the lab you see this computerized task in the this task you see a set of shelves now there are objects on these shelves on some of them and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set of shelves and there are some objects that he can't see they're occluded from his point of view with a kind of gray piece of wood this is the same set of shelves from his point of view notice that there are only some objects that he can see whereas there are many more objects that you can see now your task is to move objects around the director standing behind the set of shells is going to direct you to move objects around but remember he's not going to ask you to move objects that he can't see this introduces a really interesting condition whereby there's a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director's perspective so imagine he tells you to move the top truck left there are three trucks there you're going to instinctively go for the white truck cuz that's the top truck from your perspective but then you have to remember oh he can't see that truck so he must mean me to move the blue truck which is the top truck from his perspective now believe it or not normal healthy intelligent adults like you make errors about 50% of the time on that kind of trial they move the white truck instead of the blue truck so we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults and we also have a control condition where there's no director and instead we give people a rule we tell them okay we're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there's no director instead you've got to ignore objects with a dark gray background you'll see that this is exactly the same condition only in the no director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule whereas in the director condition they have to remember to take into account the director's perspective in order to guide their ongoing Behavior okay so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood and what you're going to see is a percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions so the gray is the direct dor condition and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50% of the time whereas they make far fewer errors when there's no director present when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background developmentally these two conditions develop in exactly the same way between late childhood and midadolescence there's an improvement in other words a reduction of errors in both of these trials in both of these conditions but it's when you compare the last two groups the mid-adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting because there there is no continued Improvement in the no direct condition in other words everything you need to do to in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence whereas in contrast if you look at the last two gray bars there's still a significant Improvement in the directed condition between midadolescence and adulthood and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing Behavior which is something by the way that we do in everyday life all the time time is still developing in mid to late adolescence so if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you think you sometimes think they have problems taking other people's perspectives you're right they do and this is why so we we sometimes um laugh about teenagers we they're parodied sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage Behavior they take risks they're sometimes Moody they're very self-conscious I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine who said that the thing he noticed most about his teenage daughters before and after puberty was their level of embarrassment in front of him so he said before puberty if my two daughters were messing around in a shop I'd say hey stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing their favorite song after puberty that became the threat the very notion of their dad singing in public was enough to make them behave so people often ask well is adolescence a kind of recent phenomena is it something we've invented recently in the west and actually the answer is probably not there are lots of descriptions of adolescence in in history that sound very similar to the descriptions we Ed today so there's a famous uh quote by Shakespeare from the Winters Tale where he describes adolescence as follows I would there were no age between 10 and 3 and 20 or that youth would sleep out the rest for there's nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging the ancient tree stealing fighting he then goes on to say having said that would any but these boiled brains of 19 and 2 and20 hunt in this weather so almost 400 years ago Shakespeare was portraying Adolescence in a very similar light to the light that we portray them in today but today we try to understand their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain so for example take risk-taking we know that adoles an are have a tendency to take risks they do they take more risks than children or adults and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they're with their friends there's a important drive to become independent from one's parents and to impress one's friends in adolescence but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the lyic system so I'm going to show you the lyic system in red in the slide behind me and also on this brain so the lyic system is Right deep inside the brain and it's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing it gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things including taking risks it gives you the kick out of taking risks and this region the the regions within the lyic system have been found to be hyper sensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults and at the very same time the prefrontal cortex which you can see in blue in the slide here which stops us taking excessive risks is still very much in development in adolescence so brain research has shown that the Adolescent brain undergoes really quite profound development and this has implications for education for rehabilitation and intervention the environment including teaching can and does shape the developing adolescent brain and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been routinely educating teenagers in the west all four of my grandparents for examp example left school in their early adolescence they had no choice and that's still the case for many many teenagers around the world today 40% of teenagers don't have access to secondary school education and yet this is a period of life where the brain is particularly adaptable and malleable it's a fantastic opportunity for Learning and creativity so what's sometimes seen as the problem with adolescence heightened risk-taking poor impul s control self-consciousness shouldn't be stigmatized it actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and Social Development thank [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] 15 years ago it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life back then 15 years ago we didn't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and Development Across the lifespan in the past decade or so mainly due to advances in brain imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging or MRI neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages and to track changes in brain structure and brain function so we use structural MRI if you like to take a snapshot a photograph at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain and we can ask questions like how much gray matter does does the brain contain and how does that change with age and we also use functional MRI called fmri to take a video a movie of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something so many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development but by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood and instead the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the 20s and 30s so adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological hormonal physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable independent role in society it can go on a long time one of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex so this is uh this is a model of the human brain and this is prefrontal cortex right at the front prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area it's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions things like decisionmaking planning planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year inhibiting inappropriate behav Behavior so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid it's also involved in social interaction understanding other people and self-awareness so MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence so if you look at gry matter volume for example gry matter volume across age from Age 4 to 22 years increases during childhood which is what you can see on this graph it PE peaks in early adolescence the arrows indicate Peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex you can see that that Peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls and that's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average and then during adolescence there's a significant decline in gry matter volume in prefrontal cortex now that might sound bad but actually this is a really important developmental process because gray matter contains cell bodies and connections between cells the copses and this decline in gry matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning the elimination of unwanted synapses this is a really important process it's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in in that synapses that are being used are strengthened and copses that aren't being used in that particular environment are pruned away you can think of it a bit like pruning a rose bush you prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining important branches can grow stronger and this process which effectively fine tunes brain tissue according to the species specific environment is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions During the period of human adolesence so a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the Adolescent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age so I'll just give you an example from my lab so my lab we're interested in the social brain that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people so I like to show a a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work so this is a soccer game Michael Owen has just missed a goal and he's lying on the ground and the first aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic and instinctive social emotional responses are so within a split second of Mich Owen missing this goal everyone is doing the same thing with their arms and the same thing with their face even mik Owen as

adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people their minds their mental States their emotions and one of the findings that we've found several times now as have other labs around the world is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex which is shown in Blue on the slide and it's um right in the middle of prefrontal Cortex in the in the midline of your head this region is more active in adolescence when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults and this is actually a metaanalysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world and they all show the same thing that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decre increases during the period of adolescence and we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach a different cognitive strategy to make social decisions and one way of looking at that is to do Behavioral Studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of Behavioral task and I'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab so imagine that you're the participant in one of our experiments you come to the lab you see this computerized task in the this task you see a set of shelves now there are objects on these shelves on some of them and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set of shelves and there are some objects that he can't see they're occluded from his point of view with a kind of gray piece of wood this is the same set of shelves from his point of view notice that there are only some objects that he can see whereas there are many more objects that you can see now your task is to move objects around the director standing behind the set of shells is going to direct you to move objects around but remember he's not going to ask you to move objects that he can't see this introduces a really interesting condition whereby there's a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director's perspective so imagine he tells you to move the top truck left there are three trucks there you're going to instinctively go for the white truck cuz that's the top truck from your perspective but then you have to remember oh he can't see that truck so he must mean me to move the blue truck which is the top truck from his perspective now believe it or not normal healthy intelligent adults like you make errors about 50% of the time on that kind of trial they move the white truck instead of the blue truck so we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults and we also have a control condition where there's no director and instead we give people a rule we tell them okay we're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there's no director instead you've got to ignore objects with a dark gray background you'll see that this is exactly the same condition only in the no director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule whereas in the director condition they have to remember to take into account the director's perspective in order to guide their ongoing Behavior okay so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood and what you're going to see is a percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions so the gray is the direct dor condition and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50% of the time whereas they make far fewer errors when there's no director present when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background developmentally these two conditions develop in exactly the same way between late childhood and midadolescence there's an improvement in other words a reduction of errors in both of these trials in both of these conditions but it's when you compare the last two groups the mid-adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting because there there is no continued Improvement in the no direct condition in other words everything you need to do to in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence whereas in contrast if you look at the last two gray bars there's still a significant Improvement in the directed condition between midadolescence and adulthood and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing Behavior which is something by the way that we do in everyday life all the time time is still developing in mid to late adolescence so if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you think you sometimes think they have problems taking other people's perspectives you're right they do and this is why so we we sometimes um laugh about teenagers we they're parodied sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage Behavior they take risks they're sometimes Moody they're very self-conscious I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine who said that the thing he noticed most about his teenage daughters before and after puberty was their level of embarrassment in front of him so he said before puberty if my two daughters were messing around in a shop I'd say hey stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing their favorite song after puberty that became the threat the very notion of their dad singing in public was enough to make them behave so people often ask well is adolescence a kind of recent phenomena is it something we've invented recently in the west and actually the answer is probably not there are lots of descriptions of adolescence in in history that sound very similar to the descriptions we Ed today so there's a famous uh quote by Shakespeare from the Winters Tale where he describes adolescence as follows I would there were no age between 10 and 3 and 20 or that youth would sleep out the rest for there's nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging the ancient tree stealing fighting he then goes on to say having said that would any but these boiled brains of 19 and 2 and20 hunt in this weather so almost 400 years ago Shakespeare was portraying Adolescence in a very similar light to the light that we portray them in today but today we try to understand their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain so for example take risk-taking we know that adoles an are have a tendency to take risks they do they take more risks than children or adults and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they're with their friends there's a important drive to become independent from one's parents and to impress one's friends in adolescence but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the lyic system so I'm going to show you the lyic system in red in the slide behind me and also on this brain so the lyic system is Right deep inside the brain and it's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing it gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things including taking risks it gives you the kick out of taking risks and this region the the regions within the lyic system have been found to be hyper sensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults and at the very same time the prefrontal cortex which you can see in blue in the slide here which stops us taking excessive risks is still very much in development in adolescence so brain research has shown that the Adolescent brain undergoes really quite profound development and this has implications for education for rehabilitation and intervention the environment including teaching can and does shape the developing adolescent brain and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been routinely educating teenagers in the west all four of my grandparents for examp example left school in their early adolescence they had no choice and that's still the case for many many teenagers around the world today 40% of teenagers don't have access to secondary school education and yet this is a period of life where the brain is particularly adaptable and malleable it's a fantastic opportunity for Learning and creativity so what's sometimes seen as the problem with adolescence heightened risk-taking poor impul s control self-consciousness shouldn't be stigmatized it actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and Social Development thank [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] 15 years ago it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life back then 15 years ago we didn't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and Development Across the lifespan in the past decade or so mainly due to advances in brain imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging or MRI neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages and to track changes in brain structure and brain function so we use structural MRI if you like to take a snapshot a photograph at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain and we can ask questions like how much gray matter does does the brain contain and how does that change with age and we also use functional MRI called fmri to take a video a movie of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something so many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development but by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood and instead the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the 20s and 30s so adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological hormonal physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable independent role in society it can go on a long time one of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex so this is uh this is a model of the human brain and this is prefrontal cortex right at the front prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area it's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions things like decisionmaking planning planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year inhibiting inappropriate behav Behavior so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid it's also involved in social interaction understanding other people and self-awareness so MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence so if you look at gry matter volume for example gry matter volume across age from Age 4 to 22 years increases during childhood which is what you can see on this graph it PE peaks in early adolescence the arrows indicate Peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex you can see that that Peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls and that's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average and then during adolescence there's a significant decline in gry matter volume in prefrontal cortex now that might sound bad but actually this is a really important developmental process because gray matter contains cell bodies and connections between cells the copses and this decline in gry matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning the elimination of unwanted synapses this is a really important process it's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in in that synapses that are being used are strengthened and copses that aren't being used in that particular environment are pruned away you can think of it a bit like pruning a rose bush you prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining important branches can grow stronger and this process which effectively fine tunes brain tissue according to the species specific environment is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions During the period of human adolesence so a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the Adolescent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age so I'll just give you an example from my lab so my lab we're interested in the social brain that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people so I like to show a a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work so this is a soccer game Michael Owen has just missed a goal and he's lying on the ground and the first aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic and instinctive social emotional responses are so within a split second of Mich Owen missing this goal everyone is doing the same thing with their arms and the same thing with their face even mik Owen as he slides along the grass is doing the same thing with his arms and presumably has a similar facial expression and the only people who don't are the guys in yellow at the back and I I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium and they're doing another social emotional response that we all instantly recognize and that's the second aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates how good we are at reading other people Behavior their actions their gestures their facial expressions in terms of their underlying emotions and mental States so you don't have to ask any of these guys you have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling and thinking at this precise moment in time so that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab so we in my lab we bring

the wrong end of the stadium and they're doing another social emotional response that we all instantly recognize and that's the second aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates how good we are at reading other people Behavior their actions their gestures their facial expressions in terms of their underlying emotions and mental States so you don't have to ask any of these guys you have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling and thinking at this precise moment in time so that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab so we in my lab we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people their minds their mental States their emotions and one of the findings that we've found several times now as have other labs around the world is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex which is shown in Blue on the slide and it's um right in the middle of prefrontal Cortex in the in the midline of your head this region is more active in adolescence when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults and this is actually a metaanalysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world and they all show the same thing that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decre increases during the period of adolescence and we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach a different cognitive strategy to make social decisions and one way of looking at that is to do Behavioral Studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of Behavioral task and I'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab so imagine that you're the participant in one of our experiments you come to the lab you see this computerized task in the this task you see a set of shelves now there are objects on these shelves on some of them and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set of shelves and there are some objects that he can't see they're occluded from his point of view with a kind of gray piece of wood this is the same set of shelves from his point of view notice that there are only some objects that he can see whereas there are many more objects that you can see now your task is to move objects around the director standing behind the set of shells is going to direct you to move objects around but remember he's not going to ask you to move objects that he can't see this introduces a really interesting condition whereby there's a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director's perspective so imagine he tells you to move the top truck left there are three trucks there you're going to instinctively go for the white truck cuz that's the top truck from your perspective but then you have to remember oh he can't see that truck so he must mean me to move the blue truck which is the top truck from his perspective now believe it or not normal healthy intelligent adults like you make errors about 50% of the time on that kind of trial they move the white truck instead of the blue truck so we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults and we also have a control condition where there's no director and instead we give people a rule we tell them okay we're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there's no director instead you've got to ignore objects with a dark gray background you'll see that this is exactly the same condition only in the no director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule whereas in the director condition they have to remember to take into account the director's perspective in order to guide their ongoing Behavior okay so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood and what you're going to see is a percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions so the gray is the direct dor condition and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50% of the time whereas they make far fewer errors when there's no director present when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background developmentally these two conditions develop in exactly the same way between late childhood and midadolescence there's an improvement in other words a reduction of errors in both of these trials in both of these conditions but it's when you compare the last two groups the mid-adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting because there there is no continued Improvement in the no direct condition in other words everything you need to do to in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence whereas in contrast if you look at the last two gray bars there's still a significant Improvement in the directed condition between midadolescence and adulthood and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing Behavior which is something by the way that we do in everyday life all the time time is still developing in mid to late adolescence so if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you think you sometimes think they have problems taking other people's perspectives you're right they do and this is why so we we sometimes um laugh about teenagers we they're parodied sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage Behavior they take risks they're sometimes Moody they're very self-conscious I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine who said that the thing he noticed most about his teenage daughters before and after puberty was their level of embarrassment in front of him so he said before puberty if my two daughters were messing around in a shop I'd say hey stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing their favorite song after puberty that became the threat the very notion of their dad singing in public was enough to make them behave so people often ask well is adolescence a kind of recent phenomena is it something we've invented recently in the west and actually the answer is probably not there are lots of descriptions of adolescence in in history that sound very similar to the descriptions we Ed today so there's a famous uh quote by Shakespeare from the Winters Tale where he describes adolescence as follows I would there were no age between 10 and 3 and 20 or that youth would sleep out the rest for there's nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging the ancient tree stealing fighting he then goes on to say having said that would any but these boiled brains of 19 and 2 and20 hunt in this weather so almost 400 years ago Shakespeare was portraying Adolescence in a very similar light to the light that we portray them in today but today we try to understand their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain so for example take risk-taking we know that adoles an are have a tendency to take risks they do they take more risks than children or adults and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they're with their friends there's a important drive to become independent from one's parents and to impress one's friends in adolescence but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the lyic system so I'm going to show you the lyic system in red in the slide behind me and also on this brain so the lyic system is Right deep inside the brain and it's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing it gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things including taking risks it gives you the kick out of taking risks and this region the the regions within the lyic system have been found to be hyper sensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults and at the very same time the prefrontal cortex which you can see in blue in the slide here which stops us taking excessive risks is still very much in development in adolescence so brain research has shown that the Adolescent brain undergoes really quite profound development and this has implications for education for rehabilitation and intervention the environment including teaching can and does shape the developing adolescent brain and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been routinely educating teenagers in the west all four of my grandparents for examp example left school in their early adolescence they had no choice and that's still the case for many many teenagers around the world today 40% of teenagers don't have access to secondary school education and yet this is a period of life where the brain is particularly adaptable and malleable it's a fantastic opportunity for Learning and creativity so what's sometimes seen as the problem with adolescence heightened risk-taking poor impul s control self-consciousness shouldn't be stigmatized it actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and Social Development thank [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby We often hear that studying literature involves finding a deeper meaning to a text. When writing about literary works, we're expected to mentally dive below the surface in order to come back up with big ideas. But you may find yourself looking at the flat page of a book, wondering how deep it can really go? How do we reach those ideas that turn into great essays? Well, there are two crucial thinking steps that can lead us in the right direction: practicing insight and acknowledging complexity. Insight is the ability to arrive at an intuitive understanding of a big idea using only small clues to get there. If you're practicing insight, you'll able to use observations about character behavior to figure out their true emotions and motivations. Pay attention to little things because they add up to what is really meaningful. For example, if you consider a character like Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice, who openly declares his dislike for Miss Lizzy Bennet, you might, at first, assume he's just a mean guy. But, using your powers of insight, you're noticing other smaller things - how Darcy's eyes linger on Lizzy's face and how he seems all flustered when she's around. Add to the mix your knowledge that Mr. Darcy is in a much higher social class than Lizzy, and your sense of insight should be telling you that there's something more here. In this case, it will tell you that Darcy's surface behavior is in conflict with his true feelings of attraction because the difference in wealth between himself and Lizzy makes him feel that it'll never work. Thinking about all those small clues gives us insight about some of the big, abstract ideas within the novel that we can approach in an essay: appearances versus reality, the power of wealth and social stratification, and the unpredictable nature of love and attraction. Look at that! Deeper meaning. The second step to a sophisticated analysis is acknowledging complexity. Let's face it. In both life and literature, situations are complicated due to social forces like relationships, moral codes, personal desires, and power structures. This means that there are, at any given time, multiple factors that shape what is true. In order to acknowledge complexity in your writing, refrain from making broad generalizations about a text or establishing quick, simple judgements about a character. Explore each facet of your subject carefully and make sure to consider multiple influences on events. Explain the tension of multiple forces that create the story. For example, a basic analysis of Toni Morrison's Beloved, where the protagonist has killed her own child rather than allow her to grow up in slavery, might sound like this, "Sethe murdered her own daughter. This act was wrong, and causes the ghost of the child to haunt her throughout the novel." These observations are simplistic. They don't acknowledge all the different forces that contribute to what the character has done. Try something like this instead, "A culture of slavery disturbs the ability to determine what is morally right. Sethe's past experiences with violence reinforce the fear she has for her child's fate, and transform the murder into a protective act. As the novel progresses, Sethe is haunted both by the angry spirit of her daughter and by the memories of everything else slavery took from her." Here, we see those influential forces at work, and we've shown off our ability to understand the complicated nature of the human experience, which, again, allows us to access those big ideas that reveal the deeper meaning of a story, ideas, in this case, like the parameters of maternal instinct, the consequences of injustice, and the question of whether or not ethics can even exist in a corrupted moral system. It's impossible to sit down and write an amazing essay about literature without first thinking about it. Before you hit the keys, go back to the text and fish out the small moments, the complicated moments in the story. Line them up in your mind, practice insight, acknowledge complexity, arrive at some big ideas. Before you know it, the deeper meaning will be close at hand.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby We often hear that studying literature involves finding a deeper meaning to a text. When writing about literary works, we're expected to mentally dive below the surface in order to come back up with big ideas. But you may find yourself looking at the flat page of a book, wondering how deep it can really go? How do we reach those ideas that turn into great essays? Well, there are two crucial thinking steps that can lead us in the right direction: practicing insight and acknowledging complexity. Insight is the ability to arrive at an intuitive understanding of a big idea using only small clues to get there. If you're practicing insight, you'll able to use observations about character behavior to figure out their true emotions and motivations. Pay attention to little things because they add up to what is really meaningful. For example, if you consider a character like Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice, who openly declares his dislike for Miss Lizzy Bennet, you might, at first, assume he's just a mean guy. But, using your powers of insight, you're noticing other smaller things - how Darcy's eyes linger on Lizzy's face and how he seems all flustered when she's around. Add to the mix your knowledge that Mr. Darcy is in a much higher social class than Lizzy, and your sense of insight should be telling you that there's something more here. In this case, it will tell you that Darcy's surface behavior is in conflict with his true feelings of attraction because the difference in wealth between himself and Lizzy makes him feel that it'll never work. Thinking about all those small clues gives us insight about some of the big, abstract ideas within the novel that we can approach in an essay: appearances versus reality, the power of wealth and social stratification, and the unpredictable nature of love and attraction. Look at that! Deeper meaning. The second step to a sophisticated analysis is acknowledging complexity. Let's face it. In both life and literature, situations are complicated due to social forces like relationships, moral codes, personal desires, and power structures. This means that there are, at any given time, multiple factors that shape what is true. In order to acknowledge complexity in your writing, refrain from making broad generalizations about a text or establishing quick, simple judgements about a character. Explore each facet of your subject carefully and make sure to consider multiple influences on events. Explain the tension of multiple forces that create the story. For example, a basic analysis of Toni Morrison's Beloved, where the protagonist has killed her own child rather than allow her to grow up in slavery, might sound like this, "Sethe murdered her own daughter. This act was wrong, and causes the ghost of the child to haunt her throughout the novel." These observations are simplistic. They don't acknowledge all the different forces that contribute to what the character has done. Try something like this instead, "A culture of slavery disturbs the ability to determine what is morally right. Sethe's past experiences with violence reinforce the fear she has for her child's fate, and transform the murder into a protective act. As the novel progresses, Sethe is haunted both by the angry spirit of her daughter and by the memories of everything else slavery took from her." Here, we see those influential forces at work, and we've shown off our ability to understand the complicated nature of the human experience, which, again, allows us to access those big ideas that reveal the deeper meaning of a story, ideas, in this case, like the parameters of maternal instinct, the consequences of injustice, and the question of whether or not ethics can even exist in a corrupted moral system. It's impossible to sit down and write an amazing essay about literature without first thinking about it. Before you hit the keys, go back to the text and fish out the small moments, the complicated moments in the story. Line them up in your mind, practice insight, acknowledge complexity, arrive at some big ideas. Before you know it, the deeper meaning will be close at hand.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest the generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about identifying a potential "big idea" to discuss within a text, and the correct option is the one that is NOT an example of a big idea. The generated MCQs do not directly ask about identifying big ideas, but some of them relate to the concept of big ideas or deeper understanding of a text.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, as it asks about the main idea of the transcript, which is related to the concept of big ideas. However, the options in Question 8 do not match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

A more relevant generated MCQ is Question 10, which asks about the result of practicing insight and acknowledging complexity in literary analysis. The correct option in Question 10 mentions "A deeper understanding of the text and access to big ideas," which is related to the concept of big ideas. However, the question intent and options in Question 10 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Given the available options, I would suggest that Question 10 is the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ, although it is not an exact match.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby How big was that fish you caught? This big? This big? This big? Without photographic evidence, there's nothing that proves you caught a whopper, and that's been true since the dawn of fishing. In fact, hundreds of years ago, long before photography could capture the moment, Japanese fishermen invented their own way to record trophy catches. They called it Gyotaku. Gyotaku is the ancient art of printing fish that originated in Japan as a way to record trophy catches prior to the modern day camera. Gyo means fish and taku means impression. There are several different stories about how Gyotaku came about, but it basically started with fishermen needing a way to record the species and size of the fish they caught over 100 years ago. Fishermen took paper, ink, and brushes out to sea with them. They told stories of great adventures at sea. Since the Japanese revered certain fish, the fishermen would take a rubbing from these fish and release them. To make the rubbing, they would paint the fish with non-toxic sumi-e ink and print them on rice paper. This way they could be released or cleaned and sold at market. The first prints like this were for records only with no extra details. It wasn't until the mid 1800's that they began painting eye details and other embellishments onto the prints. One famous nobleman, Lord Sakai, was an avid fisherman, and, when he made a large catch, he wanted to preserve the memory of the large, red sea bream. To do so, he commissioned a fisherman to print his catch. After this, many fisherman would bring their Gyotaku prints to Lord Sakai, and if he liked their work, he would hire them to print for him. Many prints hung in the palace during the Edo period. After this period, Gyotaku was not as popular and began to fade away. Today, Gyotaku has become a popular art form, enjoyed by many. And the prints are said to bring good luck to the fishermen. But the art form is quite different than it used to be. Most artists today learn on their own by trial and error. Before the artist begins to print, the fish needs to be prepared for printing. First, the artist places the fish on a hollowed out surface. Then the artist spreads the fins out and pins them down on the board to dry. They then clean the fish with water. When it comes time to print, there are two different methods. The indirect method begins with pasting moist fabric or paper onto the fish using rice paste. Then, the artist uses a tompo, or a cotton ball covered in silk, to put ink on the fabric or paper to produce the print. This method requires more skill and great care needs to be taken when pulling the paper off the fish so the paper doesn't tear. In the direct method, the artist paints directly on the fish, and then gently presses the moist fabric or paper into the fish. With both of these methods, no two prints are exactly alike, but both reveal dramatic images of the fish. For the final touch, the artist uses a chop, or a stamp, and signs their work, and can hold it up to say, "The fish was exactly this big!"

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The next time you see a news report of a hurricane or a tropical storm showing high winds battering trees and houses, ask yourself, "How did the wind get going so fast?" Amazingly enough, this is a motion that started more than five billion years ago. But, to understand why, we need to understand spin. In physics, we talk about two types of motion. The first is straight-line motion. You push on something, and it moves forward. The second type, spin, involves an object rotating, or turning on its axis in place. An object in straight-line motion will move forever unless something, like the friction of the ground beneath it, causes it to slow down and stop. The same thing happens when you get something spinning. It will keep on spinning until something stops it. But the spin can speed up. If an ice skater is gliding across the ice in straight-line motion and she pulls her arms in, she keeps on gliding at the same speed. But if she is spinning on the ice and she pulls her arms in, you know what happens next. She spins faster. This is called the conservation of angular momentum. Mathematically, angular momentum is a product of two numbers, one that gives the spin rate and one that gives the distance of the mass from the axis. If something is freely spinning, as one number gets bigger, the other gets smaller. Arms closer, spin faster. Arms farther, spin slower. Spin causes other effects, too. If you are riding on a spinning merry-go-round and you toss a ball to a friend, it will appear to follow a curving path. It doesn't actually curve, though. It really goes in a straight line. You were the one who was following a curving path, but, from your point of view, the ball appears to curve. We call this the coriolis effect. Oh, and you are riding on a speeding merry-go-round right now at this very moment. We call it the Earth. The Earth spins on its axis once each day. But why does the Earth spin? Now, that's a story that starts billions of years ago. A cloud of dust and gas that form the Sun and the Earth and the planets and you and me started to collapse as gravity pulled it all together. Before it started to collapse, this cloud had a very gentle spin. And, as it collapsed, like that ice skater pulling her arms in, the spin got faster and faster. And everything that formed out of the cloud, the Sun and the planets around the Sun and the moons around the planets, all inherited this spin. And this inherited spin is what gives us night and day. And this day-night cycle is what drives our weather. The Earth is warm on the daytime side, cool on the nighttime side, and it's warmer at the equator than at the poles. The differences in temperature make differences in air pressure, and the differences in air pressure make air move. They make the wind blow. But, because the Earth spins, the moving air curves to the right in the Northern Hemisphere because of the coriolis effect. If there's a region of low pressure in the atmosphere, air is pushed toward it, like water going down a drain. But the air curves to the right as it goes, and this gives it a spin. With the dramatic low pressure in a storm, the air gets pulled in tighter and tighter, so it gets going faster and faster, and this is how we get the high winds of a hurricane. So, when you see a spinning storm on a weather report, think about this: The spin ultimately came from the spin of the Earth, and the Earth's spin is a remnant, a fossil relic, of the gentle spin of the cloud of dust and gas that collapsed to make the Earth some five billion years ago. You are watching something, the spin, that is older than dirt, that's older than rocks, that's older than the Earth itself.

None of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, the most similar generated MCQ is:

Question 3: According to the conservation of angular momentum, what happens to the spin rate of an object when its arms are pulled in? 

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable generated MCQ should be related to the motion of an object in a straight line.

A possible match could be a generated MCQ that asks about the behavior of an object moving in a straight line with no forces acting on it. Unfortunately, such a question does not exist among the provided generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the least dissimilar question, I would choose:

Question 2: What happens to the spin of an object when it is slowed down by friction?

However, please note that this is a very weak match and does not accurately represent the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I will provide the index of the least dissimilar question:

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The next time you see a news report of a hurricane or a tropical storm showing high winds battering trees and houses, ask yourself, "How did the wind get going so fast?" Amazingly enough, this is a motion that started more than five billion years ago. But, to understand why, we need to understand spin. In physics, we talk about two types of motion. The first is straight-line motion. You push on something, and it moves forward. The second type, spin, involves an object rotating, or turning on its axis in place. An object in straight-line motion will move forever unless something, like the friction of the ground beneath it, causes it to slow down and stop. The same thing happens when you get something spinning. It will keep on spinning until something stops it. But the spin can speed up. If an ice skater is gliding across the ice in straight-line motion and she pulls her arms in, she keeps on gliding at the same speed. But if she is spinning on the ice and she pulls her arms in, you know what happens next. She spins faster. This is called the conservation of angular momentum. Mathematically, angular momentum is a product of two numbers, one that gives the spin rate and one that gives the distance of the mass from the axis. If something is freely spinning, as one number gets bigger, the other gets smaller. Arms closer, spin faster. Arms farther, spin slower. Spin causes other effects, too. If you are riding on a spinning merry-go-round and you toss a ball to a friend, it will appear to follow a curving path. It doesn't actually curve, though. It really goes in a straight line. You were the one who was following a curving path, but, from your point of view, the ball appears to curve. We call this the coriolis effect. Oh, and you are riding on a speeding merry-go-round right now at this very moment. We call it the Earth. The Earth spins on its axis once each day. But why does the Earth spin? Now, that's a story that starts billions of years ago. A cloud of dust and gas that form the Sun and the Earth and the planets and you and me started to collapse as gravity pulled it all together. Before it started to collapse, this cloud had a very gentle spin. And, as it collapsed, like that ice skater pulling her arms in, the spin got faster and faster. And everything that formed out of the cloud, the Sun and the planets around the Sun and the moons around the planets, all inherited this spin. And this inherited spin is what gives us night and day. And this day-night cycle is what drives our weather. The Earth is warm on the daytime side, cool on the nighttime side, and it's warmer at the equator than at the poles. The differences in temperature make differences in air pressure, and the differences in air pressure make air move. They make the wind blow. But, because the Earth spins, the moving air curves to the right in the Northern Hemisphere because of the coriolis effect. If there's a region of low pressure in the atmosphere, air is pushed toward it, like water going down a drain. But the air curves to the right as it goes, and this gives it a spin. With the dramatic low pressure in a storm, the air gets pulled in tighter and tighter, so it gets going faster and faster, and this is how we get the high winds of a hurricane. So, when you see a spinning storm on a weather report, think about this: The spin ultimately came from the spin of the Earth, and the Earth's spin is a remnant, a fossil relic, of the gentle spin of the cloud of dust and gas that collapsed to make the Earth some five billion years ago. You are watching something, the spin, that is older than dirt, that's older than rocks, that's older than the Earth itself.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. However, the options provided for Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match can be found in Question 5, option C, which states that the Earth's spin is "a remnant of the spin of the cloud of dust and gas that collapsed to make the Earth." This option directly relates to the content of the ground truth MCQ.

However, an even more suitable match is not explicitly listed among the generated MCQs. But if we were to choose the closest one, it would be Question 5, as it discusses the origin of the Earth's spin, which is related to the content of the ground truth MCQ.

But since the options provided for Question 5 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and Question 3 is a more general match. We could say that the closest match would be Question 3 if it had an option related to the cloud of dust and gas.

However, among the provided options, Question 5, option C is the closest match.

So the answer would be Question 5.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The healthy liver cell divides only when it's stressed. The healthy hair cell divides frequently. And the cancer cell divides even more frequently and recklessly. "The first draft that I saw was, like, four days before it was supposed to go online or something like that, and I hadn't heard, you know I hadn't heard, so, I was like, 'Hey, guys, just wondering if you need me for anything?' You know? And so she floods my inbox with emails, being like, 'Yes, we actually need you for a bunch of stuff!' And it was great. Like, when I first saw it, I mean, you immediately get the whole natural versus unnatural technique." "Not good for you?" "Right, yes, there you go, good for you and not good for you. Seeing that, actually, was really cool because, I mean, I had no idea. Writing the script, you have no idea what it's going to turn out like in the end. But you get this, like, intuitive feel of 'Okay, like, yeah, I get why this is a cancer cell, and I get why this is a healthy cell.' And, actually, I showed it to, I showed an early draft to the professor with whom I was fact-checking the script who is a cancer researcher at MIT, and he said that it was one of the best visualizations of cancer cells that he'd ever seen. So, that was really cool to hear as well." "When you get a script, do you make a storyboard or not?" "I guess it depends on the method that we use to produce the piece because, for example, things that would definitely be character-heavy, like 'Ladder of Inference', we worked with a storyboard from beginning to end because we were dealing with character animation. And something like that is much different than stop-motion, for example. But, also, I mean Biljana and I have also worked together for, like, nearly ten years or something absurd so we don't need as much of a, you know, a piece of paper to tell us what to do, whereas, if I were working with someone new, then I would really want to work with a storyboard, but we kind of trust each other." "So, you, like, finish... ...each other's sentences." "We can try that again." "No, we definitely shouldn't use that, it's too cheesy." "So, there was a part in the video where we had to represent how the cells reproduce and how chemotherapy affects it. And it became quite complicated for me to visualize, so I actually had to ask you to draw little doodles for me to actually explain that. How was that for you? How was that experience?" "I mean, it was pretty difficult for me to visualize, too, so, it was interesting. Doing the storyboard actually helped me clarify in my head, like, how it actually works because when you have to explain something to someone else, with anything, obviously, you have to, like, really figure it out yourself. And, then, when you have to draw it, that requires you to take an extra level of abstraction and figure out, like, okay, like, what are the parts of this drawing that are really important? What do I have to show clearly, and how do I show it? And, so, doing that on a legal pad, which is, I think, how I ended up sending it to you guys, taking a picture of myself on camera, really helped, you know, me understand the crucial, and that's the crucial part of why chemotherapy actually works. So, it was a really interesting experience." "Yeah, we actually started that on a, we had a whiteboard, and I was trying to figure out that process. I think we started at the beginning from cell division and multiplying and, you know, chemotherapy working. But then it became so crazy that I had to pull back and start from the end and go in a different direction. So, that became quite a challenge, too, figuring it out." "We ended up using the visual that you gave us on the storyboard, which is really cool to have that sort of collaboration with the educator with whom you're working." "And I can't draw, so that should be noted. It was a very rough storyboard." "It was good enough." "Good enough!"

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: Analytical Question**

Although the question stems are not identical, the intent and content of Question 4 are closest to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions relate to the process of creating a TED-Ed Lesson and the role of the educator in that process. The options in Question 4 also touch on the idea of collaboration and trust between the educator and the animator, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about a specific step in the process of creating a TED-Ed Lesson, whereas the generated MCQs are more focused on the collaboration and visualization aspects of the process.

If I had to choose an index, I would say:

**Index: 4**

Please keep in mind that this is an approximate match, and the generated MCQs may not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

so wouldn't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do as we're walking around being able to to point the phone at anything and then haven't actually recognized images and objects like the human brain and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of knowledge and experiences and ideas well traditionally that was seen as science fiction but now we've moved to a world where actually this has become possible so the best way of explaining it is to just show it what you can see over here is tomorrow who's holding my phone that's now plugged in so let me start with this what we have here is a painting of the great poet Robbie Burns and it's just a normal image but if we now switch inputs over to the phone running our technology you can see effectively what tamiya seeing on the screen and when she points at this image something magical happens I no matter blinks and now what's great about this is there's no trickery here there's no there's nothing done to this image and what's great about this is the technologies that she allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like other human brain does not only that but as I move the object around the book it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly again the thing that's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become all the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself now this is applications everywhere whether in things like art museums like you just saw or in the world of say advertising or print journalism so a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed here is this morning's newspaper and we have some Wimbledon news which is great now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin ring you adapt and you you have to be flexible you have to be willing to change direction at a split-second and she does all that she's won this title and that linking of the the digital content is something that's physical is what we call an aura and I'll be using that term Anila as we go through the talk so what's great about this is it isn't just a faster more convenient way to get information in the real world but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible so what I have here is a wireless fruta and my American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router so that everyone here understands but nonetheless here is the device so now what I can do is rather than getting the instructions for the device online I can simply pointed it the device is recognized and then begin by plugging in the grate it yourself cable then connect the power finally the yellow Ethernet cable congratulations you have now completed setup awesome thank you the incredible work that made that possible was done here in the UK by by scientists at Cambridge and they work in our offices and I've got a lovely picture of them here they couldn't all be on stage but we're going to bring that over to the stage so here they are they're not very animated so this was the fourth take I'm told ok so as we're talking about Cambridge let's now move on to technical advancements because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones are less than less than 12 months ago the speed and the processor in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate and that means that I can now take cinema quality 3d models and place them in the world around me so I have one over here tomorrow would you like to jump in as sleepin so then after the fun comes the more emotional side of what we do because effectively this technology allows you to see the world through someone's eyes and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world what's great about this is the tools to do this are free they're open and they're available to everyone within our application and educators have really got on board with with the classrooms so we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks teachers who've tagged up school classrooms and a great example of this is a school in the UK I have a picture here from a video and we're now going to play it now move the other side see what happens move away from it and come back to it have you got it again so it's not magic it's available for everyone to do and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right now so I sort of I'm told it's called a stadium wave so we're gonna start from this side of the room on the count of three and go over to here tomorrow are you recording okay so you all ready one two three go fellows are really good now okay now we're going to switch back into the Aurasma plication and what tomorrow's gonna do is is tag that video that we just took onto my my badge so that I can remember it forever now we have lots of people who are doing this already and we've talked a little about the educational side on the emotional side we have people who've done things like sent postcards and Christmas cards back to their family with with little messages on we have people who have for example taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more you can point and discover the information we're all very very familiar with the Internet in the last 20 years it's really changed the way that we live and work and the way that we see the world and what's great is we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift because now we can literally take the content that we share we discover and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us it's completely free to download this application if you have a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G this process is very very quick I'll play up we can save it now it's just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint and the great thing is if you're a professional user so in newspaper the tools are pretty much identical to what we've just used to create this administration the only difference is that you've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content you're now ready okay so I'm Toby ready which means we can now point at the image and there you all are well done creeping around my thankee

**Transcript**:
I know, insects, it's really weird, but bear with me. Now, I am an entomologist. I confess to that. And, when I look at the planet, the reason I'm an entomologist is because out of the 1.9 million species that are described on planet Earth, over 1 million of them are insects. And I truly believe as a scientist today we live in the best of times because here we are enjoying TED, and Facebook, and YouTube, and this wonderful theater, healthcare, longer life spans. But we also live in the worst of times because we are on a planet
with 7 billion people with a lot of problems. And for those of us
who look at biodiversity, it's a heart-wrenching
and wonderful time all together because we see the links
between nature and people, and we're losing them at the same time. Both honeybees and humans
originate in East Africa. And, here in Kenya, a wonderful
relationship exists where a bird called
a honeyguide, up there, has this interesting phenomenon where it actually leads either humans, which it's done for thousands of years, 77,000 year old paintings from Tanzania, and the honey badger to the wild honeybee colony. Now, for a long time
we thought this relationship first evolved between the honeyguide and the honey badger. But it turns out that it actually evolved between the human and the honeyguide, and the badger's a parasite. Now, when we look at bees, there is this amazing diversity out there, 20,000 species. And one in three bites of food that we eat is thanks to an insect pollinator. So one of the things I'm working on is looking at those links between nature and sustainable human life. And here are just
a few of the beautiful bees that we have in Kenya, in fact, not far from Nairobi. Now, how many of you like coffee? Yeah, I actually can't drink it because if I do, my hands shake, and I can't pick up ants and bees. Chocolate? I love chocolate, the darker the better, so I really like chocolate. Now the thing is,
without insect pollinators, there would be very little coffee and no chocolate on the planet. Could you imagine that? That's really scary! Now, I want to show you out of thousands of examples that I could have brought here today to show you how insects
are connected to your life, to every single human being on the planet. Here are two colleagues and friends. Domina is a farmer in Mwanza in western Tanzania, and Peter is from the Kerio Valley in northwestern Kenya. Now, Domina grows pigeon feed, cow feed, a whole wide range of legumes. And she feeds her family, she survives in a very remote area based off of these amazing crops, legumes, a lot of traditional vegetables, and all of them are pollinated by these different wild bee species. Now, Peter grows five varieties
of mango on his farm, and he actually paid for his education by growing and selling mangoes. And I really like mangoes and so it's really a great
pleasure working on the farm with five different varieties of mango. And if you look at all these
different fruits and crops here, one thing that connects us to biodiversity and one thing we do as a scientist, we write papers. We do research, and we write papers. Nobody ever reads them, but here's one of my papers. It's on the African violet. This is in the U.S. This florist sells
about 10,000 dollars worth of violets a year. It's worth about 6
billion dollars in trade. It originates in East Africa, and we never knew what pollinated it. Well, I went off and studied this. One thing to say about pollinators is it comes done to being about sex. And how many of you like sex? Where are we, the Vatican? So what happens when insects
help plants have sex is there's really good sex. This is an example of really good sex. So basically the bee comes along, it vibrates the flower at a specific frequency, 11 to 12 hertz, pollen is released, and the plant survives in the wild. This is one of the world's most endangered
plants. We go up into the deserts
of northern Kenya, which are now very famous because of the discovery of oil. But I will tell you
a little different story. These animals, the camel, which allow life in this
very remote community, are browsing off of a shrub
called indigofera, and indigofera is 100%
dependent on bee pollination. So all these wild bees
produce the indigofera, which the camels and goats eat. And we look at a community like this, Nalaray, northern Samburu, and people will look at these children and say they are poor. And I disagree because over lunch we collected
30 different bee species in the Acacia where they had their lunch and 400 pollinator species
in the Acacia tortilis where their classroom is located. So I want to leave you
with a radical piece of technology called the bee hotel that you can innovate
and build for yourself. Create a habitat where
bees can nest and live in your own backyard. But more importantly, please create space in your hearts for insects. Spend five minutes a day
with them if you can. And I believe that if the one lesson we can learn from insects is that meek shall inherit the Earth.

without insect pollinators, there would be very little coffee and no chocolate on the planet. Could you imagine that? That's really scary! Now, I want to show you out of thousands of examples that I could have brought here today to show you how insects
are connected to your life, to every single human being on the planet. Here are two colleagues and friends. Domina is a farmer in Mwanza in western Tanzania, and Peter is from the Kerio Valley in northwestern Kenya. Now, Domina grows pigeon feed, cow feed, a whole wide range of legumes. And she feeds her family, she survives in a very remote area based off of these amazing crops, legumes, a lot of traditional vegetables, and all of them are pollinated by these different wild bee species. Now, Peter grows five varieties
of mango on his farm, and he actually paid for his education by growing and selling mangoes. And I really like mangoes and so it's really a great
pleasure working on the farm with five different varieties of mango. And if you look at all these
different fruits and crops here, one thing that connects us to biodiversity and one thing we do as a scientist, we write papers. We do research, and we write papers. Nobody ever reads them, but here's one of my papers. It's on the African violet. This is in the U.S. This florist sells
about 10,000 dollars worth of violets a year. It's worth about 6
billion dollars in trade. It originates in East Africa, and we never knew what pollinated it. Well, I went off and studied this. One thing to say about pollinators is it comes done to being about sex. And how many of you like sex? Where are we, the Vatican? So what happens when insects
help plants have sex is there's really good sex. This is an example of really good sex. So basically the bee comes along, it vibrates the flower at a specific frequency, 11 to 12 hertz, pollen is released, and the plant survives in the wild. This is one of the world's most endangered
plants. We go up into the deserts
of northern Kenya, which are now very famous because of the discovery of oil. But I will tell you
a little different story. These animals, the camel, which allow life in this
very remote community, are browsing off of a shrub
called indigofera, and indigofera is 100%
dependent on bee pollination. So all these wild bees
produce the indigofera, which the camels and goats eat. And we look at a community like this, Nalaray, northern Samburu, and people will look at these children and say they are poor. And I disagree because over lunch we collected
30 different bee species in the Acacia where they had their lunch and 400 pollinator species
in the Acacia tortilis where their classroom is located. So I want to leave you
with a radical piece of technology called the bee hotel that you can innovate
and build for yourself. Create a habitat where
bees can nest and live in your own backyard. But more importantly, please create space in your hearts for insects. Spend five minutes a day
with them if you can. And I believe that if the one lesson we can learn from insects is that meek shall inherit the Earth.

I know, insects, it's really weird, but bear with me. Now, I am an entomologist. I confess to that. And, when I look at the planet, the reason I'm an entomologist is because out of the 1.9 million species that are described on planet Earth, over 1 million of them are insects. And I truly believe as a scientist today we live in the best of times because here we are enjoying TED, and Facebook, and YouTube, and this wonderful theater, healthcare, longer life spans. But we also live in the worst of times because we are on a planet
with 7 billion people with a lot of problems. And for those of us
who look at biodiversity, it's a heart-wrenching
and wonderful time all together because we see the links
between nature and people, and we're losing them at the same time. Both honeybees and humans
originate in East Africa. And, here in Kenya, a wonderful
relationship exists where a bird called
a honeyguide, up there, has this interesting phenomenon where it actually leads either humans, which it's done for thousands of years, 77,000 year old paintings from Tanzania, and the honey badger to the wild honeybee colony. Now, for a long time
we thought this relationship first evolved between the honeyguide and the honey badger. But it turns out that it actually evolved between the human and the honeyguide, and the badger's a parasite. Now, when we look at bees, there is this amazing diversity out there, 20,000 species. And one in three bites of food that we eat is thanks to an insect pollinator. So one of the things I'm working on is looking at those links between nature and sustainable human life. And here are just
a few of the beautiful bees that we have in Kenya, in fact, not far from Nairobi. Now, how many of you like coffee? Yeah, I actually can't drink it because if I do, my hands shake, and I can't pick up ants and bees. Chocolate? I love chocolate, the darker the better, so I really like chocolate. Now the thing is,

**Transcript**:
If you wake up one morning with 1,000 times the strength
you had the night before, how will you handle
delicate day-to-day tasks? Everything must seem so fragile to you since the scale of your strength has expanded one thousand times. You'd have to be very careful when you're shaking someone's hand so you don't end up breaking their bones or crushing everyone you hug. And using a fork to pick
up a piece of broccoli from a Styrofoam plate without driving the fork through the plate is going to be as difficult
as brain surgery. Say the day comes and you get the chance
to save a damsel in distress falling from a helicopter. So, you hold out your arms, hoping to catch her. Seconds later, you will find yourself holding her lifeless body. What happened? Well, pressure is force divided by area. The smaller the area, the bigger the pressure. This is why we can lift heavy objects without breaking our skin, but a tiny needle can make us bleed with just a little poke. The pressure that will be
exerted on her body can be calculated by force divided by the area
on the top of your arms that comes in contact with her. It doesn't matter if your arms
are strong enough to catch her body
without breaking your bones. Her spine is not strong enough to be caught by you without being damaged. Even if you rip off the nearest door to provide a bigger
area to catch her with, you still wouldn't be
able to save her anyway. Remember, it's not
the fall that kills her, but the sudden stop at the bottom. Let's say she's falling
from a 32 story building, about 300 feet, and you are 6 feet tall, maybe 10 feet on your tippy-toes, with your arms above your head holding a door, in hopes of distributing the pressure across a larger surface area, but all you're doing is essentially moving the ground up by 10 feet. So, she's now falling from 290 feet, instead of 300 feet, reaching the speed of 173 feet per second just before impact, not counting air resistance. It's the equivalent of crashing
at 94 miles per hour into a wall with a door in front of it. The only thing that could
save her is flying. But that power comes with its
own host of scientific issues. If you could fly, what you must do is fly up to her, start flying down at the speed
she is falling, hold on to her, then gradually slow down until you come to a complete stop. This process requires
a lot of cushion space between the point she starts
falling and the ground. Every second you waste on changing into your superhero costume and flying up to her height, her head is getting that much
closer to the pavement! If she's falling from a high place, and you can't get to her until she's only a few feet
above the ground, there's really nothing you can do other than magically turn the pavement into marshmellow to allow her enough time
to slowly come to a stop. Then, break out the chocolate
and graham crackers and you've got s'mores. Mmmm, delicious! Now, which superpower physics lesson will you explore next? Shifting body size and content, super speed, flight, super strength, immortality, and invisibility.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
If you wake up one morning with 1,000 times the strength
you had the night before, how will you handle
delicate day-to-day tasks? Everything must seem so fragile to you since the scale of your strength has expanded one thousand times. You'd have to be very careful when you're shaking someone's hand so you don't end up breaking their bones or crushing everyone you hug. And using a fork to pick
up a piece of broccoli from a Styrofoam plate without driving the fork through the plate is going to be as difficult
as brain surgery. Say the day comes and you get the chance
to save a damsel in distress falling from a helicopter. So, you hold out your arms, hoping to catch her. Seconds later, you will find yourself holding her lifeless body. What happened? Well, pressure is force divided by area. The smaller the area, the bigger the pressure. This is why we can lift heavy objects without breaking our skin, but a tiny needle can make us bleed with just a little poke. The pressure that will be
exerted on her body can be calculated by force divided by the area
on the top of your arms that comes in contact with her. It doesn't matter if your arms
are strong enough to catch her body
without breaking your bones. Her spine is not strong enough to be caught by you without being damaged. Even if you rip off the nearest door to provide a bigger
area to catch her with, you still wouldn't be
able to save her anyway. Remember, it's not
the fall that kills her, but the sudden stop at the bottom. Let's say she's falling
from a 32 story building, about 300 feet, and you are 6 feet tall, maybe 10 feet on your tippy-toes, with your arms above your head holding a door, in hopes of distributing the pressure across a larger surface area, but all you're doing is essentially moving the ground up by 10 feet. So, she's now falling from 290 feet, instead of 300 feet, reaching the speed of 173 feet per second just before impact, not counting air resistance. It's the equivalent of crashing
at 94 miles per hour into a wall with a door in front of it. The only thing that could
save her is flying. But that power comes with its
own host of scientific issues. If you could fly, what you must do is fly up to her, start flying down at the speed
she is falling, hold on to her, then gradually slow down until you come to a complete stop. This process requires
a lot of cushion space between the point she starts
falling and the ground. Every second you waste on changing into your superhero costume and flying up to her height, her head is getting that much
closer to the pavement! If she's falling from a high place, and you can't get to her until she's only a few feet
above the ground, there's really nothing you can do other than magically turn the pavement into marshmellow to allow her enough time
to slowly come to a stop. Then, break out the chocolate
and graham crackers and you've got s'mores. Mmmm, delicious! Now, which superpower physics lesson will you explore next? Shifting body size and content, super speed, flight, super strength, immortality, and invisibility.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Some superheroes can grow to the size of a building at will. That's very intimidating! But a scientist must ask where the extra material is coming from. The Law of Conservation of Mass implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, which means that our hero's mass will not change just
because his size changes. For instance, when we bake
a fluffy sponge cake, even though the resulting delicious treat is much bigger in size
than the cake batter that went into the oven, the weight of the cake
batter should still equal the weight of the cake plus the moisture that has evaporated. In a chemical equation, molecules rearrange to make new compounds, but all the components should
still be accounted for. When our hero expands from 6 feet tall to 18 feet tall, his height triples. Galileo's Square Cube Law says his weight will be 27 - 3 times 3 times 3 equals 27 - times his regular weight since he has to expand
in all three dimensions. So, when our superhero
transforms into a giant, we are dealing with two possibilities. Our hero towering at 18 feet still only weighs 200 pounds, the original weight in this human form. Now, option two, our hero
weighs 5,400 pounds - 200 pounds times 27
equals 5,400 pounds - when he is 18 feet tall, which means he also weighs 5,400 pounds when he is 6 feet tall. Nobody can get in the same
elevator with him without the alarm going off. Now, option two seems a little more scientifically plausible, but it begs the question, how does he ever walk through the park without sinking into the ground since the pressure
he is exerting on the soil is calculated by his mass divided by the area
of the bottom of his feet? And what kind of super
socks and super shoes is he putting on his feet
to withstand all the friction that results from dragging
his 5,400 pound body against the road when he runs? And can he even run? And I won't even ask how he finds pants flexible enough to withstand
the expansion. Now, let's explore the density of the two options mentioned above. Density is defined as mass
divided by volume. The human body is made
out of bones and flesh, which has a relatively set density. In option one, if the hero
weighs 200 pounds all the time, then he would be bones
and flesh at normal size. When he expands to a bigger size while still weighing 200 pounds, he essentially turns himself into a giant, fluffy teddy bear. In option two, if the hero weighs 5,400 pounds all the time, then he would be bones
and flesh at 18 feet with 5,400 pounds of weight
supported by two legs. The weight would be
exerted on the leg bones at different angles as he moves. Bones, while hard, are not malleable, meaning they do not bend, so they break easily. The tendons would also
be at risk of tearing. Tall buildings stay standing because they have steel frames and do not run and jump
around in the jungle. Our hero, on the other hand, one landing at a bad angle and he's down. Assuming his bodily function
is the same as any mammal's, his heart would need to pump
a large amount of blood throughout his body
to provide enough oxygen for him to move 5,400 pounds
of body weight around. This would take tremendous energy, which he would need to provide by consuming 27 times 3,000
calories of food every day. Now, that is roughly 150 Big Macs. 27 times 3,000 calculated equals 81,000 calculated slash 550 calories equals 147. He wouldn't have time to fight crime because he would be eating all the time and working a 9-to-5 job in order to afford all the food he eats. And what about superheroes who can turn their bodies
into rocks or sand? Well, everything on Earth
is made out of elements. And what defines each element is the number of protons in the nucleus. That is how our periodic
table is organized. Hydrogen has one proton, helium, two protons, lithium, three protons, and so on. The primary component
of the most common form of sand is silicon dioxide. Meanwhile, the human body consists of 65% oxygen, 18% carbon, 10% hydrogen, and 7% of various other elements including 0.002% of silicon. In a chemical reaction, the elements recombine
to make new compounds. So, where is he getting all this silicon necessary to make the sand? Sure, we can alter elements by nuclear fusion or nuclear fission. However, nuclear fusion
requires so much heat, the only natural occurrence
of this process is in stars. In order to utilize fusion
in a short amount of time, the temperature of the area needs to be hotter than the Sun. Every innocent bystander
will be burned to a crisp. Rapid nuclear fission is not any better since it often results
in many radioactive particles. Our hero would become a walking, talking nuclear power plant, ultimately harming
every person he tries to save. And do you really want the heat of the Sun or a radioactive nuclear
plant inside of your body? Now, which superpower physics lesson will you explore next? Shifting body size and content, super speed, flight, super strength, immortality, and invisibility.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 4, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 5
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Some superheroes can grow to the size of a building at will. That's very intimidating! But a scientist must ask where the extra material is coming from. The Law of Conservation of Mass implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, which means that our hero's mass will not change just
because his size changes. For instance, when we bake
a fluffy sponge cake, even though the resulting delicious treat is much bigger in size
than the cake batter that went into the oven, the weight of the cake
batter should still equal the weight of the cake plus the moisture that has evaporated. In a chemical equation, molecules rearrange to make new compounds, but all the components should
still be accounted for. When our hero expands from 6 feet tall to 18 feet tall, his height triples. Galileo's Square Cube Law says his weight will be 27 - 3 times 3 times 3 equals 27 - times his regular weight since he has to expand
in all three dimensions. So, when our superhero
transforms into a giant, we are dealing with two possibilities. Our hero towering at 18 feet still only weighs 200 pounds, the original weight in this human form. Now, option two, our hero
weighs 5,400 pounds - 200 pounds times 27
equals 5,400 pounds - when he is 18 feet tall, which means he also weighs 5,400 pounds when he is 6 feet tall. Nobody can get in the same
elevator with him without the alarm going off. Now, option two seems a little more scientifically plausible, but it begs the question, how does he ever walk through the park without sinking into the ground since the pressure
he is exerting on the soil is calculated by his mass divided by the area
of the bottom of his feet? And what kind of super
socks and super shoes is he putting on his feet
to withstand all the friction that results from dragging
his 5,400 pound body against the road when he runs? And can he even run? And I won't even ask how he finds pants flexible enough to withstand
the expansion. Now, let's explore the density of the two options mentioned above. Density is defined as mass
divided by volume. The human body is made
out of bones and flesh, which has a relatively set density. In option one, if the hero
weighs 200 pounds all the time, then he would be bones
and flesh at normal size. When he expands to a bigger size while still weighing 200 pounds, he essentially turns himself into a giant, fluffy teddy bear. In option two, if the hero weighs 5,400 pounds all the time, then he would be bones
and flesh at 18 feet with 5,400 pounds of weight
supported by two legs. The weight would be
exerted on the leg bones at different angles as he moves. Bones, while hard, are not malleable, meaning they do not bend, so they break easily. The tendons would also
be at risk of tearing. Tall buildings stay standing because they have steel frames and do not run and jump
around in the jungle. Our hero, on the other hand, one landing at a bad angle and he's down. Assuming his bodily function
is the same as any mammal's, his heart would need to pump
a large amount of blood throughout his body
to provide enough oxygen for him to move 5,400 pounds
of body weight around. This would take tremendous energy, which he would need to provide by consuming 27 times 3,000
calories of food every day. Now, that is roughly 150 Big Macs. 27 times 3,000 calculated equals 81,000 calculated slash 550 calories equals 147. He wouldn't have time to fight crime because he would be eating all the time and working a 9-to-5 job in order to afford all the food he eats. And what about superheroes who can turn their bodies
into rocks or sand? Well, everything on Earth
is made out of elements. And what defines each element is the number of protons in the nucleus. That is how our periodic
table is organized. Hydrogen has one proton, helium, two protons, lithium, three protons, and so on. The primary component
of the most common form of sand is silicon dioxide. Meanwhile, the human body consists of 65% oxygen, 18% carbon, 10% hydrogen, and 7% of various other elements including 0.002% of silicon. In a chemical reaction, the elements recombine
to make new compounds. So, where is he getting all this silicon necessary to make the sand? Sure, we can alter elements by nuclear fusion or nuclear fission. However, nuclear fusion
requires so much heat, the only natural occurrence
of this process is in stars. In order to utilize fusion
in a short amount of time, the temperature of the area needs to be hotter than the Sun. Every innocent bystander
will be burned to a crisp. Rapid nuclear fission is not any better since it often results
in many radioactive particles. Our hero would become a walking, talking nuclear power plant, ultimately harming
every person he tries to save. And do you really want the heat of the Sun or a radioactive nuclear
plant inside of your body? Now, which superpower physics lesson will you explore next? Shifting body size and content, super speed, flight, super strength, immortality, and invisibility.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine yourself standing on a beach, looking out over the ocean, waves crashing against the shore, blue as far as your eyes can see. Let it really sink in, the sheer scope and size of it all. Now, ask yourself, "How big is it? How big is the ocean?" First thing, we need to understand
that there really is only one ocean, consisting of five component
basins that we call the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian,
the Arctic, and the Southern. Each of these five, while generally referred to as oceans in and of themselves, are really and truly a part of a single,
massive body of water, one ocean, which defines the very face
of planet Earth. The ocean covers roughly 71%
of our planet's surface, some 360 million square kilometers, an area in excess
of the size of 36 USAs. It’s such a vast spread,
when viewed from space, the ocean is, by far,
the dominant feature of our planet. Speaking of space, the ocean currently
holds over 1.3 billion— that’s billion with a “b”— cubic kilometers of water. Put another way, that’s enough water to immerse
the entire United States under a body of salt water
over 132 kilometers tall— a height well beyond the reach
of the highest clouds and extending deep
into the upper atmosphere. With all that volume, the ocean represents 97%
of Earth’s total water content. On top of all that, the ocean contains upwards of 99%
of the world’s biosphere, that is, the spaces and places
where life exists. Now let that sink in for a second. The immediate world as we know it, indeed the totality
of all the living space encompassed by the continents themselves, all of that represents only 1%
of the biosphere— 1%! The ocean is everything else. So, the ocean is physically massive. It's importance to life
is practically unparalleled. It also happens to hold the greatest
geological features of our planet. Quickly, here are four
of the most notable. The ocean contains
the world's largest mountain range, the mid-ocean ridge. At roughly 65,000 kilometers long, this underwater range is some 10 times
longer than the longest mountain chain found purely on dry land—
the Andes. Beneath the Denmark Strait exists
the world’s largest waterfall. This massive cataract carries
roughly 116 times more water per second over its edge
than the Congo River’s Inga Falls, the largest waterfall by volume on land. The world's tallest mountain
is actually found in the ocean, hiding in plain sight. While 4,200 meters of Hawaii’s Mauna Kea
sit above sea level, its sides plummet beneath the waves
for another 5,800 meters. From its snow-covered top
to it’s silt-covered bottom, then, this Hawaiian mountain is roughly
10,000 meters in height, dwarfing tiny Everest’s paltry peak
by well over a kilometer. And, since we’re picking on poor Everest, let's consider the world's deepest canyon, the Challenger Deep: existing 11 kilometers
below the ocean's surface, some six times deeper
than the Grand Canyon. That's deep enough to sink
Mount Everest into and still have over 2.1 kilometers
of water sitting atop its newly submerged peak. Put another way, the depth
of the Challenger Deep is roughly the same height
that commercial airliners travel. So, pretty much however
you choose to slice it, the ocean is capital B, capital I,
capital G— BIG! It defines our planet, home to the greatest geological features, comprises the largest living space, and accordingly, is home to the greatest
numbers and forms of life on Earth. It is practically incomprehensible
in scope. But it is not so big, so vast,
so extraordinary as to be untouchable. In fact, with roughly 50%
of the world's population living within 100 kilometers
of a coastline, and with most of the remainder living close enough to lakes,
rivers, or swamps, all of which ultimately lead to the ocean, virtually every single
person on the planet has the opportunity to influence
the general health and nature of the world ocean. Evidence of human influence is seen
in every part of the ocean, no matter how deep,
no matter how distant. The ocean defines our planet, but, in a very real sense, we define the ocean.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine yourself standing on a beach, looking out over the ocean, waves crashing against the shore, blue as far as your eyes can see. Let it really sink in, the sheer scope and size of it all. Now, ask yourself, "How big is it? How big is the ocean?" First thing, we need to understand
that there really is only one ocean, consisting of five component
basins that we call the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian,
the Arctic, and the Southern. Each of these five, while generally referred to as oceans in and of themselves, are really and truly a part of a single,
massive body of water, one ocean, which defines the very face
of planet Earth. The ocean covers roughly 71%
of our planet's surface, some 360 million square kilometers, an area in excess
of the size of 36 USAs. It’s such a vast spread,
when viewed from space, the ocean is, by far,
the dominant feature of our planet. Speaking of space, the ocean currently
holds over 1.3 billion— that’s billion with a “b”— cubic kilometers of water. Put another way, that’s enough water to immerse
the entire United States under a body of salt water
over 132 kilometers tall— a height well beyond the reach
of the highest clouds and extending deep
into the upper atmosphere. With all that volume, the ocean represents 97%
of Earth’s total water content. On top of all that, the ocean contains upwards of 99%
of the world’s biosphere, that is, the spaces and places
where life exists. Now let that sink in for a second. The immediate world as we know it, indeed the totality
of all the living space encompassed by the continents themselves, all of that represents only 1%
of the biosphere— 1%! The ocean is everything else. So, the ocean is physically massive. It's importance to life
is practically unparalleled. It also happens to hold the greatest
geological features of our planet. Quickly, here are four
of the most notable. The ocean contains
the world's largest mountain range, the mid-ocean ridge. At roughly 65,000 kilometers long, this underwater range is some 10 times
longer than the longest mountain chain found purely on dry land—
the Andes. Beneath the Denmark Strait exists
the world’s largest waterfall. This massive cataract carries
roughly 116 times more water per second over its edge
than the Congo River’s Inga Falls, the largest waterfall by volume on land. The world's tallest mountain
is actually found in the ocean, hiding in plain sight. While 4,200 meters of Hawaii’s Mauna Kea
sit above sea level, its sides plummet beneath the waves
for another 5,800 meters. From its snow-covered top
to it’s silt-covered bottom, then, this Hawaiian mountain is roughly
10,000 meters in height, dwarfing tiny Everest’s paltry peak
by well over a kilometer. And, since we’re picking on poor Everest, let's consider the world's deepest canyon, the Challenger Deep: existing 11 kilometers
below the ocean's surface, some six times deeper
than the Grand Canyon. That's deep enough to sink
Mount Everest into and still have over 2.1 kilometers
of water sitting atop its newly submerged peak. Put another way, the depth
of the Challenger Deep is roughly the same height
that commercial airliners travel. So, pretty much however
you choose to slice it, the ocean is capital B, capital I,
capital G— BIG! It defines our planet, home to the greatest geological features, comprises the largest living space, and accordingly, is home to the greatest
numbers and forms of life on Earth. It is practically incomprehensible
in scope. But it is not so big, so vast,
so extraordinary as to be untouchable. In fact, with roughly 50%
of the world's population living within 100 kilometers
of a coastline, and with most of the remainder living close enough to lakes,
rivers, or swamps, all of which ultimately lead to the ocean, virtually every single
person on the planet has the opportunity to influence
the general health and nature of the world ocean. Evidence of human influence is seen
in every part of the ocean, no matter how deep,
no matter how distant. The ocean defines our planet, but, in a very real sense, we define the ocean.

**Transcript**:
a couple of years ago when I was attending the TED conference in Long Beach I met Harriet now we'd actually met online before you know not the way you're thinking we were actually introduced because we both knew Linda av one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies and because we shared our genetic information with Linda she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA haplotype K 1 a 1 B 1 a which meant that we were distantly related we actually shared the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman so Ozzie Harriet and me and being the current day of course we start our own Facebook group you're all welcome to join and when I met Harriet and person the next year at the TED conference she'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype t-shirts now why am I telling you this story what does this have to do with the future of health well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bioinformatics to the connection of the internet and social networking what I like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies you know we often think linearly but if you think about it if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day 2 4 8 16 15 days of 32,000 what do you think you have in a month or at a billion so if we start to think exponentially we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us and many of these technologies speaking as a physician and innovator we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of healthcare and to address many of the major challenges that we have in healthcare today ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population the way we really don't use information very well today the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation and one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left we spend most of our money on the last 20% of life what if we get spend and incentivize physicians and healthcare system in our own self to move the curve to left improve our health leveraging technology as well now my favorite technology example of exponential technology we all have in our pocket so if you just think about it these are really dramatically improving I mean this is the iPhone 4 imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do now I've gained some insight into this I've been the track chair for the medicine portion of a new institution called singularity University based in Silicon Valley and we bring together each summer about 100 very talented students from around the world and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine biotech artificial intelligence robotics nanotechnology space and address how could cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals we also have seven-day executive programs and coming up next month is actually future mat a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine now I mentioned the phone these mobile phones have over I think 20,000 different mobile apps available to the point where there's one out of the UK where you can pee in a little chip connect it to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD and I try that yet but that's available there other sorts of applications merging your phone and diagnostics for example measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that Prudential e to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic so let's see now how exponential technologies are taking healthcare let's start with faster well it's no secret that computers through Moore's law are speeding up faster and faster we have the ability to do more powerful things with them they're really approaching in many cases surpassing the ability of the human mind but what I think computational speed is most applicable is that of imaging the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible we're layering multiple technologies PET scan CT scans and molecular diagnostics to find and seek things at different levels here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done to date reconstructed of Bartho - the curator of TEDMED and now we can see inside of the brain at a resolution and ability that was never before available and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even re-engineer or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand pathology disease and therapy we can look at side with real-time fMRI in the brain at real-time and by understanding these sorts of processes in these connections we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective for example psychoactive drugs the scanners for these are getting smaller and less expensive and more portable and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge the scan of today takes up about 800 books or 20 gigabytes the scan of just in a couple years will be one terabyte or 800,000 books how do we leverage the information let's get personal I won't ask you here's how to colonoscopy but if you're over age 50 it's time for your screening colonoscopy how would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick well now there's essentially virtual colonoscopy compare those two pictures and now as the radiologist you can Sochi fly through your patients calling and augmenting that with artificial intelligence identify potential as you see here a lesion that we might have missed it but using AI on top of radiology we can find lesions that were missed before and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise and this is an example this paradigm shift we're moving to this integration of biomedicine information technology wireless and I would say mobile now this era of digital medicine so even my stethoscope is now digital and of course there's an app for that we're moving obviously to the era of the tricorder so the handheld ultrasound is facially surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope these are now at a price point of what used to be a hundred thousand euros or a couple hundred thousand dollars for about five thousand dollars I can have the power with very powerful diagnostic device in my hand and merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records in the United States we're still less than 20% electronic here in the Netherlands I think it's more than 80% but now that we're switching to merging medical data making it available electronically we can crowdsource that information and now as a physician I can access my patients data from wherever I am just through my mobile device and now of course we're in the era of the iPad even the iPad 2 and just last month the first fda-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices so certainly the physicians of the day including myself are completely reliable on these devices and as you saw just about a month ago Watson from IBM beat the two champions in jeopardy so I want you to imagine we're in a couple years we start to apply this cloud-based information well we really have the AI physician and leverage our own brains and connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done RT today you don't need to go to visit your physician in many cases only about 20% of actual visits you need to lay hands on the patient we're now in the era of virtual visits from sort of the Skype type visits you can do with American well to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system the ability to interact with your healthcare provider is different and these are on being augmented even by our devices again today here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room I can do some Diagnostics in that way or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology like the Microsoft Kinect and hack that to enable let's say Diagnostics for example in diagnosing stroke using simple motion detection using $100 devices we can actually now visit our patients robotically this is the rp7 if I'm a hematologist visit another clinic for visit a hospital these are being augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now so imagine we already have wireless scales you can step on the scale you can tweet your way to your friends and they can keep you in line we out wireless blood pressure cuffs a whole gamut of these technologies are being put together so instead of wearing these glue G devices we can put on a simple this is developed by colleagues at Stanford called the eye rhythm completely supplants the prior technology and a much lower price point with much more effective 'ti now we're also in the ear today of quantified self consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices like this little Fitbit I can measure my steps my caloric outtake I can get insight to that on a daily basis I can share that with my friends with my physician there's watches coming now that I'll measure your heart rate Zeo sleep monitors all suite of tools that can able get a leverage and have insight into your own health and if we start to integrate this information we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies health and wellness there's even mirrors today I can pick up your pulse rate and I would argue in the future we'll have wearable devices in our clothes modern in ourselves 24/7 and just like we have the OnStar system in cars your red light might go on and once a check engine light it's going to be check your body light and go in and get and take care of and probably in a few years we'll check in to your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you okay for those of you with with kiddos at home how would you like to have the the wireless diaper that sir supports here too much information I think that you might need but it's it's gonna be here now we've heard a lot today about technology and connection and I think actually some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of Medicine as augmented by these sorts of technologies now we talk about augmenting the patient to some degree how about augmenting the physician we're now near super labeling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery which is here today at a level that was not really possible even five years ago and now this has been automated further layers of technology like augmented reality so the surgeon can see inside the patient through their lens where the tumor is where the blood vessels are this can be integrated with decision support a surgeon in New York and be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam for example and we're entering era a really truly scarless surgery called notes where the endoscope robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all on a scarless wedding and robotically and this is called notes and this is coming basically scarless surgery is mediated by robotic surgery now how about controlling other elements for those who have disabilities the paraplegic there's the ear of brain computer interface or BCI where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a cursor or a wheelchair or initially a robotic arm and these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients still in clinical trials but imagine when we can connect these for example to the amazing bionic limb such as those of the DECA arm built by Dean Kaman and colleagues which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they've had in the past so we're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually if you haven't lost a limb you've had a stroke for example you can wear these augmented lambs or if you're a paraplegic like I visited the folks at Brooklyn bionics they've developed a legs I took this video last week here's a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons these otherwise complete world's you're bound and now this is the early era of wearable robotics and I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies we're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be super ability or super enabling this is Aimee Mullins who lost her lower limbs as a young child and Hugh her who is a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident and now both of these can climb better move faster swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal abled persons now how about other Exponential's consider the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction including with huge costs but the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller so a few examples we're now in the era of Fantastic Voyage the eye pill you can swallow this completely integrated device it can take pictures of your GI system help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract we need to even smaller micro robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons can't do in much less invasive manner sometimes it might have self-assemble in your GI system and be augmented that reality on the cardiac side pacemakers are getting small are much easier to place so you don't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them and they're going to be wirelessly to limit it again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely these are shrinking even further here's one that's in prototyping by Medtronic that's smaller than a penny artificial retinas the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see again in early trials but moving into the future these are going to be gained changing or for those of us who are sighted how about having the assisted living contact lens Bluetooth Wi-Fi available beams back images to your eye now if you have trouble maintaining your diet it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you how about enabling the pathologist to use their cellphone again to see at a microscopic level and tell ember that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics in fact the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing we can now leveraging micro fluidics like this chip made by Steve quake at Stanford micro fluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians and put it on a chip enable thousands of tests to be done at the point-of-care anywhere in the world and this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the underserved and unable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point-of-care if we go down the small pathway a little bit further we're learning the era of nano medicine the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or micro robots that will monitor our blood system or immune system or even those that might even clear out the class from our arteries now how about exponentially cheaper not something we usually think about in the era of medicine that hard just used to be $3,400 for 10 megabytes expletive cheaper in genomics now the genome cost about a billion dollars about ten years ago when the first one came out we're now approaching essentially a thousand dollar genome probably next year in two years about a hundred dollar genome what are we going to do with hundred dollar genomes and soon we'll have millions of these tests available and that's when it gets interesting when we start to crowdsource that information and we enter the era of true personalized medicine the right drug for the right person at the right time instead of what we're doing today which is essentially the same drug for everybody so two blockbuster drug medications many cases which don't work for you the individual and many many different companies are working on on leveraging these approaches and I'll just show you a simple example from 20 through me again my data indicates that I've got by average risk for developing macular degeneration two kind of blindness but if I take that same data upload it to decode me I can look at my risk for example type 2 diabetes I'm at almost twice the risk for type 2 diabetes I might want to watch how much dessert I have the lunch break for example it might change my behavior leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenetics how my genes modulate what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important and what's in the hands of the individual and the patient will make better drug dosing and selection available so again it's not just genes it's multiple details our habits our environmental exposures when was the last time your physician asked you where you've lived geo medicine where you live what you've been exposed to can dramatically affect your health we can capture that information so genomics proteomics the environment all this data streaming at us individually and as us as poor physicians how do we manage it well we're now entering the era of systems medicine or systems biology where we can start to integrate all this information and by looking at the patterns for example in our blood of 10,000 biomarkers at a single test we can start to look with these little patterns and detect disease in a much earlier stage and this is being called by Li hood the father of the fear of p4 medicine we're going to be predictive we're going to know what you're likely to have we can be preventive that prevention can be personalized and more importantly it's going to become increasingly participatory through websites like patients like me or managing your data on a Microsoft Health fault or a Google health leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important so I'll finish up with exponentially better we'd like to get therapies better and more effective now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills what if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that me delayed blood pressure and a single therapy basically cure hypertension this is a new device that essentially is doing that that should be on the market within a year or two how about more targeted therapies for cancer right I'm an oncologist and I know today most of what we give is essentially poison we've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover it cancer stem cells so once it seemed to be really responsible for disease relapse so if you think of cancer as a weed we often can whack the weed away it seems to shrink it often comes back so we're tacking the wrong target the cancer stem cells remain and the tumor can return months or years later we're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure and we're ending the era of personalized oncology the ability to leverage all this data together analyze the tumor and come up with a real specific cocktail for the individual patient now I'll close with regenerative medicine so I've studied a lot about stem cells embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful we also have adult stem cells throughout our body we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation Geron just last year start of the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries still a phase one trial but evolving we've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics particularly in treating cardiovascular disease if we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack I invented a bicycle the marrow miner a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow it's now been FDA approved and will hopefully be on the market in the next year so hopefully you can appreciate the device that are curving through the patient's body and removing the bone marrow instead of with 200 punctures which is a single puncture under local anesthesia but where stem cell therapy really going if you think about it every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo we can have reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient making your own personalized stem cell lines and I think there'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to you know have in the freezer your own cardiac cells myocytes neural cells to use them in the future should you need them and we're integrating this now with a whole year of cellular engineering and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3d organ that's where things are going to head still very early days but I think as integration of exponential technologies this is the example so enclosed as you think about technology turns on how to impact health and medicine we're entering an era of miniaturization decentralization and personalization and I think by pulling these things together we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these we're going to empower the patient enable the doctor enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick because I know as a doctor if someone comes to me with stage one disease I'm thrilled we can often cure them but often is too late and it's stage three or four cancer for example so by leveraging these technologies together I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call stage zero medicine and as a cancer doctor I'm looking forward to being out of a job thanks very much

**Transcript**:
a couple of years ago when I was attending the TED conference in Long Beach I met Harriet now we'd actually met online before you know not the way you're thinking we were actually introduced because we both knew Linda av one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies and because we shared our genetic information with Linda she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA haplotype K 1 a 1 B 1 a which meant that we were distantly related we actually shared the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman so Ozzie Harriet and me and being the current day of course we start our own Facebook group you're all welcome to join and when I met Harriet and person the next year at the TED conference she'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype t-shirts now why am I telling you this story what does this have to do with the future of health well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bioinformatics to the connection of the internet and social networking what I like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies you know we often think linearly but if you think about it if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day 2 4 8 16 15 days of 32,000 what do you think you have in a month or at a billion so if we start to think exponentially we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us and many of these technologies speaking as a physician and innovator we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of healthcare and to address many of the major challenges that we have in healthcare today ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population the way we really don't use information very well today the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation and one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left we spend most of our money on the last 20% of life what if we get spend and incentivize physicians and healthcare system in our own self to move the curve to left improve our health leveraging technology as well now my favorite technology example of exponential technology we all have in our pocket so if you just think about it these are really dramatically improving I mean this is the iPhone 4 imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do now I've gained some insight into this I've been the track chair for the medicine portion of a new institution called singularity University based in Silicon Valley and we bring together each summer about 100 very talented students from around the world and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine biotech artificial intelligence robotics nanotechnology space and address how could cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals we also have seven-day executive programs and coming up next month is actually future mat a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine now I mentioned the phone these mobile phones have over I think 20,000 different mobile apps available to the point where there's one out of the UK where you can pee in a little chip connect it to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD and I try that yet but that's available there other sorts of applications merging your phone and diagnostics for example measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that Prudential e to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic so let's see now how exponential technologies are taking healthcare let's start with faster well it's no secret that computers through Moore's law are speeding up faster and faster we have the ability to do more powerful things with them they're really approaching in many cases surpassing the ability of the human mind but what I think computational speed is most applicable is that of imaging the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible we're layering multiple technologies PET scan CT scans and molecular diagnostics to find and seek things at different levels here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done to date reconstructed of Bartho - the curator of TEDMED and now we can see inside of the brain at a resolution and ability that was never before available and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even re-engineer or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand pathology disease and therapy we can look at side with real-time fMRI in the brain at real-time and by understanding these sorts of processes in these connections we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective for example psychoactive drugs the scanners for these are getting smaller and less expensive and more portable and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge the scan of today takes up about 800 books or 20 gigabytes the scan of just in a couple years will be one terabyte or 800,000 books how do we leverage the information let's get personal I won't ask you here's how to colonoscopy but if you're over age 50 it's time for your screening colonoscopy how would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick well now there's essentially virtual colonoscopy compare those two pictures and now as the radiologist you can Sochi fly through your patients calling and augmenting that with artificial intelligence identify potential as you see here a lesion that we might have missed it but using AI on top of radiology we can find lesions that were missed before and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise and this is an example this paradigm shift we're moving to this integration of biomedicine information technology wireless and I would say mobile now this era of digital medicine so even my stethoscope is now digital and of course there's an app for that we're moving obviously to the era of the tricorder so the handheld ultrasound is facially surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope these are now at a price point of what used to be a hundred thousand euros or a couple hundred thousand dollars for about five thousand dollars I can have the power with very powerful diagnostic device in my hand and merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records in the United States we're still less than 20% electronic here in the Netherlands I think it's more than 80% but now that we're switching to merging medical data making it available electronically we can crowdsource that information and now as a physician I can access my patients data from wherever I am just through my mobile device and now of course we're in the era of the iPad even the iPad 2 and just last month the first fda-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices so certainly the physicians of the day including myself are completely reliable on these devices and as you saw just about a month ago Watson from IBM beat the two champions in jeopardy so I want you to imagine we're in a couple years we start to apply this cloud-based information well we really have the AI physician and leverage our own brains and connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done RT today you don't need to go to visit your physician in many cases only about 20% of actual visits you need to lay hands on the patient we're now in the era of virtual visits from sort of the Skype type visits you can do with American well to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system the ability to interact with your healthcare provider is different and these are on being augmented even by our devices again today here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room I can do some Diagnostics in that way or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology like the Microsoft Kinect and hack that to enable let's say Diagnostics for example in diagnosing stroke using simple motion detection using $100 devices we can actually now visit our patients robotically this is the rp7 if I'm a hematologist visit another clinic for visit a hospital these are being augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now so imagine we already have wireless scales you can step on the scale you can tweet your way to your friends and they can keep you in line we out wireless blood pressure cuffs a whole gamut of these technologies are being put together so instead of wearing these glue G devices we can put on a simple this is developed by colleagues at Stanford called the eye rhythm completely supplants the prior technology and a much lower price point with much more effective 'ti now we're also in the ear today of quantified self consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices like this little Fitbit I can measure my steps my caloric outtake I can get insight to that on a daily basis I can share that with my friends with my physician there's watches coming now that I'll measure your heart rate Zeo sleep monitors all suite of tools that can able get a leverage and have insight into your own health and if we start to integrate this information we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies health and wellness there's even mirrors today I can pick up your pulse rate and I would argue in the future we'll have wearable devices in our clothes modern in ourselves 24/7 and just like we have the OnStar system in cars your red light might go on and once a check engine light it's going to be check your body light and go in and get and take care of and probably in a few years we'll check in to your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you okay for those of you with with kiddos at home how would you like to have the the wireless diaper that sir supports here too much information I think that you might need but it's it's gonna be here now we've heard a lot today about technology and connection and I think actually some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients and take more time and actually do the important

last year start of the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries still a phase one trial but evolving we've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics particularly in treating cardiovascular disease if we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack I invented a bicycle the marrow miner a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow it's now been FDA approved and will hopefully be on the market in the next year so hopefully you can appreciate the device that are curving through the patient's body and removing the bone marrow instead of with 200 punctures which is a single puncture under local anesthesia but where stem cell therapy really going if you think about it every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo we can have reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient making your own personalized stem cell lines and I think there'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to you know have in the freezer your own cardiac cells myocytes neural cells to use them in the future should you need them and we're integrating this now with a whole year of cellular engineering and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3d organ that's where things are going to head still very early days but I think as integration of exponential technologies this is the example so enclosed as you think about technology turns on how to impact health and medicine we're entering an era of miniaturization decentralization and personalization and I think by pulling these things together we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these we're going to empower the patient enable the doctor enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick because I know as a doctor if someone comes to me with stage one disease I'm thrilled we can often cure them but often is too late and it's stage three or four cancer for example so by leveraging these technologies together I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call stage zero medicine and as a cancer doctor I'm looking forward to being out of a job thanks very much

**Transcript**:
a couple of years ago when I was attending the TED conference in Long Beach I met Harriet now we'd actually met online before you know not the way you're thinking we were actually introduced because we both knew Linda av one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies and because we shared our genetic information with Linda she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA haplotype K 1 a 1 B 1 a which meant that we were distantly related we actually shared the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman so Ozzie Harriet and me and being the current day of course we start our own Facebook group you're all welcome to join and when I met Harriet and person the next year at the TED conference she'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype t-shirts now why am I telling you this story what does this have to do with the future of health well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bioinformatics to the connection of the internet and social networking what I like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies you know we often think linearly but if you think about it if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day 2 4 8 16 15 days of 32,000 what do you think you have in a month or at a billion so if we start to think exponentially we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us and many of these technologies speaking as a physician and innovator we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of healthcare and to address many of the major challenges that we have in healthcare today ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population the way we really don't use information very well today the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation and one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left we spend most of our money on the last 20% of life what if we get spend and incentivize physicians and healthcare system in our own self to move the curve to left improve our health leveraging technology as well now my favorite technology example of exponential technology we all have in our pocket so if you just think about it these are really dramatically improving I mean this is the iPhone 4 imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do now I've gained some insight into this I've been the track chair for the medicine portion of a new institution called singularity University based in Silicon Valley and we bring together each summer about 100 very talented students from around the world and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine biotech artificial intelligence robotics nanotechnology space and address how could cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals we also have seven-day executive programs and coming up next month is actually future mat a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine now I mentioned the phone these mobile phones have over I think 20,000 different mobile apps available to the point where there's one out of the UK where you can pee in a little chip connect it to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD and I try that yet but that's available there other sorts of applications merging your phone and diagnostics for example measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that Prudential e to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic so let's see now how exponential technologies are taking healthcare let's start with faster well it's no secret that computers through Moore's law are speeding up faster and faster we have the ability to do more powerful things with them they're really approaching in many cases surpassing the ability of the human mind but what I think computational speed is most applicable is that of imaging the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible we're layering multiple technologies PET scan CT scans and molecular diagnostics to find and seek things at different levels here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done to date reconstructed of Bartho - the curator of TEDMED and now we can see inside of the brain at a resolution and ability that was never before available and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even re-engineer or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand pathology disease and therapy we can look at side with real-time fMRI in the brain at real-time and by understanding these sorts of processes in these connections we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective for example psychoactive drugs the scanners for these are getting smaller and less expensive and more portable and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge the scan of today takes up about 800 books or 20 gigabytes the scan of just in a couple years will be one terabyte or 800,000 books how do we leverage the information let's get personal I won't ask you here's how to colonoscopy but if you're over age 50 it's time for your screening colonoscopy how would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick well now there's essentially virtual colonoscopy compare those two pictures and now as the radiologist you can Sochi fly through your patients calling and augmenting that with artificial intelligence identify potential as you see here a lesion that we might have missed it but using AI on top of radiology we can find lesions that were missed before and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise and this is an example this paradigm shift we're moving to this integration of biomedicine information technology wireless and I would say mobile now this era of digital medicine so even my stethoscope is now digital and of course there's an app for that we're moving obviously to the era of the tricorder so the handheld ultrasound is facially surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope these are now at a price point of what used to be a hundred thousand euros or a couple hundred thousand dollars for about five thousand dollars I can have the power with very powerful diagnostic device in my hand and merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records in the United States we're still less than 20% electronic here in the Netherlands I think it's more than 80% but now that we're switching to merging medical data making it available electronically we can crowdsource that information and now as a physician I can access my patients data from wherever I am just through my mobile device and now of course we're in the era of the iPad even the iPad 2 and just last month the first fda-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices so certainly the physicians of the day including myself are completely reliable on these devices and as you saw just about a month ago Watson from IBM beat the two champions in jeopardy so I want you to imagine we're in a couple years we start to apply this cloud-based information well we really have the AI physician and leverage our own brains and connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done RT today you don't need to go to visit your physician in many cases only about 20% of actual visits you need to lay hands on the patient we're now in the era of virtual visits from sort of the Skype type visits you can do with American well to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system the ability to interact with your healthcare provider is different and these are on being augmented even by our devices again today here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room I can do some Diagnostics in that way or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology like the Microsoft Kinect and hack that to enable let's say Diagnostics for example in diagnosing stroke using simple motion detection using $100 devices we can actually now visit our patients robotically this is the rp7 if I'm a hematologist visit another clinic for visit a hospital these are being augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now so imagine we already have wireless scales you can step on the scale you can tweet your way to your friends and they can keep you in line we out wireless blood pressure cuffs a whole gamut of these technologies are being put together so instead of wearing these glue G devices we can put on a simple this is developed by colleagues at Stanford called the eye rhythm completely supplants the prior technology and a much lower price point with much more effective 'ti now we're also in the ear today of quantified self consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices like this little Fitbit I can measure my steps my caloric outtake I can get insight to that on a daily basis I can share that with my friends with my physician there's watches coming now that I'll measure your heart rate Zeo sleep monitors all suite of tools that can able get a leverage and have insight into your own health and if we start to integrate this information we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies health and wellness there's even mirrors today I can pick up your pulse rate and I would argue in the future we'll have wearable devices in our clothes modern in ourselves 24/7 and just like we have the OnStar system in cars your red light might go on and once a check engine light it's going to be check your body light and go in and get and take care of and probably in a few years we'll check in to your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you okay for those of you with with kiddos at home how would you like to have the the wireless diaper that sir supports here too much information I think that you might need but it's it's gonna be here now we've heard a lot today about technology and connection and I think actually some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of Medicine as augmented by these sorts of technologies now we talk about augmenting the patient to some degree how about augmenting the physician we're now near super labeling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery which is here today at a level that was not really possible even five years ago and now this has been automated further layers of technology like augmented reality so the surgeon can see inside the patient through their lens where the tumor is where the blood vessels are this can be integrated with decision support a surgeon in New York and be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam for example and we're entering era a really truly scarless surgery called notes where the endoscope robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all on a scarless wedding and robotically and this is called notes and this is coming basically scarless surgery is mediated by robotic surgery now how about controlling other elements for those who have disabilities the paraplegic there's the ear of brain computer interface or BCI where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a cursor or a wheelchair or initially a robotic arm and these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients still in clinical trials but imagine when we can connect these for example to the amazing bionic limb such as those of the DECA arm built by Dean Kaman and colleagues which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they've had in the past so we're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually if you haven't lost a limb you've had a stroke for example you can wear these augmented lambs or if you're a paraplegic like I visited the folks at Brooklyn bionics they've developed a legs I took this video last week here's a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons these otherwise complete world's you're bound and now this is the early era of wearable robotics and I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies we're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be super ability or super enabling this is Aimee Mullins who lost her lower limbs as a young child and Hugh her who is a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident and now both of these can climb better move faster swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal abled persons now how about other Exponential's consider the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction including with huge costs but the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller so a few examples we're now in the era of Fantastic Voyage the eye pill you can swallow this completely integrated device it can take pictures of your GI system help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract we need to even smaller micro robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons can't do in much less invasive manner sometimes it might have self-assemble in your GI system and be augmented that reality on the cardiac side pacemakers are getting small are much easier to place so you don't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them and they're going to be wirelessly to limit it again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely these are shrinking even further here's one that's in prototyping by Medtronic that's smaller than a penny artificial retinas the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see again in early trials but moving into the future these are going to be gained changing or for those of us who are sighted how about having the assisted living contact lens Bluetooth Wi-Fi available beams back images to your eye now if you have trouble maintaining your diet it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you how about enabling the pathologist to use their cellphone again to see at a microscopic level and tell ember that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics in fact the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing we can now leveraging micro fluidics like this chip made by Steve quake at Stanford micro fluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians and put it on a chip enable thousands of tests to be done at the point-of-care anywhere in the world and this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the underserved and unable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point-of-care if we go down the small pathway a little bit further we're learning the era of nano medicine the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or micro robots that will monitor our blood system or immune system or even those that might even clear out the class from our arteries now how about exponentially cheaper not something we usually think about in the era of medicine that hard just used to be $3,400 for 10 megabytes expletive cheaper in genomics now the genome cost about a billion dollars about ten years ago when the first one came out we're now approaching essentially a thousand dollar genome probably next year in two years about a hundred dollar genome what are we going to do with hundred dollar genomes and soon we'll have millions of these tests available and that's when it gets interesting when we start to crowdsource that information and we enter the era of true personalized medicine the right drug for the right person at the right time instead of what we're doing today which is essentially the same drug for everybody so two blockbuster drug medications many cases which don't work for you the individual and many many different companies are working on on leveraging these approaches and I'll just show you a simple example from 20 through me again my data indicates that I've got by average risk for developing macular degeneration two kind of blindness but if I take that same data upload it to decode me I can look at my risk for example type 2 diabetes I'm at almost twice the risk for type 2 diabetes I might want to watch how much dessert I have the lunch break for example it might change my behavior leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenetics how my genes modulate what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important and what's in the hands of the individual and the patient will make better drug dosing and selection available so again it's not just genes it's multiple details our habits our environmental exposures when was the last time your physician asked you where you've lived geo medicine where you live what you've been exposed to can dramatically affect your health we can capture that information so genomics proteomics the environment all this data streaming at us individually and as us as poor physicians how do we manage it well we're now entering the era of systems medicine or systems biology where we can start to integrate all this information and by looking at the patterns for example in our blood of 10,000 biomarkers at a single test we can start to look with these little patterns and detect disease in a much earlier stage and this is being called by Li hood the father of the fear of p4 medicine we're going to be predictive we're going to know what you're likely to have we can be preventive that prevention can be personalized and more importantly it's going to become increasingly participatory through websites like patients like me or managing your data on a Microsoft Health fault or a Google health leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important so I'll finish up with exponentially better we'd like to get therapies better and more effective now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills what if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that me delayed blood pressure and a single therapy basically cure hypertension this is a new device that essentially is doing that that should be on the market within a year or two how about more targeted therapies for cancer right I'm an oncologist and I know today most of what we give is essentially poison we've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover it cancer stem cells so once it seemed to be really responsible for disease relapse so if you think of cancer as a weed we often can whack the weed away it seems to shrink it often comes back so we're tacking the wrong target the cancer stem cells remain and the tumor can return months or years later we're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure and we're ending the era of personalized oncology the ability to leverage all this data together analyze the tumor and come up with a real specific cocktail for the individual patient now I'll close with regenerative medicine so I've studied a lot about stem cells embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful we also have adult stem cells throughout our body we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation Geron just

the future should you need them and we're integrating this now with a whole year of cellular engineering and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3d organ that's where things are going to head still very early days but I think as integration of exponential technologies this is the example so enclosed as you think about technology turns on how to impact health and medicine we're entering an era of miniaturization decentralization and personalization and I think by pulling these things

medicine so even my stethoscope is now digital and of course there's an app for that we're moving obviously to the era of the tricorder so the handheld ultrasound is facially surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope these are now at a price point of what used to be a hundred thousand euros or a couple hundred thousand dollars for about five thousand dollars I can have the power with very powerful diagnostic device in my hand and merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records in the United States we're still less than 20% electronic here in the Netherlands I think it's more than 80% but now that we're switching to merging medical data making it available electronically we can crowdsource that information and now as a physician I can access my patients data from wherever I am just through my mobile device and now of course we're in the era of the iPad even the iPad 2 and just last month the first fda-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices so certainly the physicians of the day including myself are completely reliable on these devices and as you saw just about a month ago Watson from IBM beat the two champions in jeopardy so I want you to imagine we're in a couple years we start to apply this cloud-based information well we really have the AI physician and leverage our own brains and connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done RT today you don't need to go to visit your physician in many cases only about 20% of actual visits you need to lay hands on the patient we're now in the era of virtual visits from sort of the Skype type visits you can do with American well to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system the ability to interact with your healthcare provider is different and these are on being augmented even by our devices again today here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room I can do some Diagnostics in that way or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology like the Microsoft Kinect and hack that to enable let's say Diagnostics for example in diagnosing stroke using simple motion detection using $100 devices we can actually now visit our patients robotically this is the rp7 if I'm a hematologist visit another clinic for visit a hospital these are being augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now so imagine we already have wireless scales you can step on the scale you can tweet your way to your friends and they can keep you in line we out wireless blood pressure cuffs a whole gamut of these technologies are being put together so instead of wearing these glue G devices we can put on a simple this is developed by colleagues at Stanford called the eye rhythm completely supplants the prior technology and a much lower price point with much more effective 'ti now we're also in the ear today of quantified self consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices like this little Fitbit I can measure my steps my caloric outtake I can get insight to that on a daily basis I can share that with my friends with my physician there's watches coming now that I'll measure your heart rate Zeo sleep monitors all suite of tools that can able get a leverage and have insight into your own health and if we start to integrate this information we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies health and wellness there's even mirrors today I can pick up your pulse rate and I would argue in the future we'll have wearable devices in our clothes modern in ourselves 24/7 and just like we have the OnStar system in cars your red light might go on and once a check engine light it's going to be check your body light and go in and get and take care of and probably in a few years we'll check in to your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you okay for those of you with with kiddos at home how would you like to have the the wireless diaper that sir supports here too much information I think that you might need but it's it's gonna be here now we've heard a lot today about technology and connection and I think actually some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of Medicine as augmented by these sorts of technologies now we talk about augmenting the patient to some degree how about augmenting the physician we're now near super labeling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery which is here today at a level that was not really possible even five years ago and now this has been automated further layers of technology like augmented reality so the surgeon can see inside the patient through their lens where the tumor is where the blood vessels are this can be integrated with decision support a surgeon in New York and be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam for example and we're entering era a really truly scarless surgery called notes where the endoscope robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all on a scarless wedding and robotically and this is called notes and this is coming basically scarless surgery is mediated by robotic surgery now how about controlling other elements for those who have disabilities the paraplegic there's the ear of brain computer interface or BCI where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a cursor or a wheelchair or initially a robotic arm and these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients still in clinical trials but imagine when we can connect these for example to the amazing bionic limb such as those of the DECA arm built by Dean Kaman and colleagues which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they've had in the past so we're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually if you haven't lost a limb you've had a stroke for example you can wear these augmented lambs or if you're a paraplegic like I visited the folks at Brooklyn bionics they've developed a legs I took this video last week here's a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons these otherwise complete world's you're bound and now this is the early era of wearable robotics and I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies we're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be super ability or super enabling this is Aimee Mullins who lost her lower limbs as a young child and Hugh her who is a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident and now both of these can climb better move faster swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal abled persons now how about other Exponential's consider the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction including with huge costs but the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller so a few examples we're now in the era of Fantastic Voyage the eye pill you can swallow this completely integrated device it can take pictures of your GI system help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract we need to even smaller micro robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons can't do in much less invasive manner sometimes it might have self-assemble in your GI system and be augmented that reality on the cardiac side pacemakers are getting small are much easier to place so you don't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them and they're going to be wirelessly to limit it again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely these are shrinking even further here's one that's in prototyping by Medtronic that's smaller than a penny artificial retinas the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see again in early trials but moving into the future these are going to be gained changing or for those of us who are sighted how about having the assisted living contact lens Bluetooth Wi-Fi available beams back images to your eye now if you have trouble maintaining your diet it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you how about enabling the pathologist to use their cellphone again to see at a microscopic level and tell ember that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics in fact the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing we can now leveraging micro fluidics like this chip made by Steve quake at Stanford micro fluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians and put it on a chip enable thousands of tests to be done at the point-of-care anywhere in the world and this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the underserved and unable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point-of-care if we go down the small pathway a little bit further we're learning the era of nano medicine the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or micro robots that will monitor our blood system or immune system or even those that might even clear out the class from our arteries now how about exponentially cheaper not something we usually think about in the era of medicine that hard just used to be $3,400 for 10 megabytes expletive cheaper in genomics now the genome cost about a billion dollars about ten years ago when the first one came out we're now approaching essentially a thousand dollar genome probably next year in two years about a hundred dollar genome what are we going to do with hundred dollar genomes and soon we'll have millions of these tests available and that's when it gets interesting when we start to crowdsource that information and we enter the era of true personalized medicine the right drug for the right person at the right time instead of what we're doing today which is essentially the same drug for everybody so two blockbuster drug medications many cases which don't work for you the individual and many many different companies are working on on leveraging these approaches and I'll just show you a simple example from 20 through me again my data indicates that I've got by average risk for developing macular degeneration two kind of blindness but if I take that same data upload it to decode me I can look at my risk for example type 2 diabetes I'm at almost twice the risk for type 2 diabetes I might want to watch how much dessert I have the lunch break for example it might change my behavior leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenetics how my genes modulate what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important and what's in the hands of the individual and the patient will make better drug dosing and selection available so again it's not just genes it's multiple details our habits our environmental exposures when was the last time your physician asked you where you've lived geo medicine where you live what you've been exposed to can dramatically affect your health we can capture that information so genomics proteomics the environment all this data streaming at us individually and as us as poor physicians how do we manage it well we're now entering the era of systems medicine or systems biology where we can start to integrate all this information and by looking at the patterns for example in our blood of 10,000 biomarkers at a single test we can start to look with these little patterns and detect disease in a much earlier stage and this is being called by Li hood the father of the fear of p4 medicine we're going to be predictive we're going to know what you're likely to have we can be preventive that prevention can be personalized and more importantly it's going to become increasingly participatory through websites like patients like me or managing your data on a Microsoft Health fault or a Google health leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important so I'll finish up with exponentially better we'd like to get therapies better and more effective now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills what if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that me delayed blood pressure and a single therapy basically cure hypertension this is a new device that essentially is doing that that should be on the market within a year or two how about more targeted therapies for cancer right I'm an oncologist and I know today most of what we give is essentially poison we've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover it cancer stem cells so once it seemed to be really responsible for disease relapse so if you think of cancer as a weed we often can whack the weed away it seems to shrink it often comes back so we're tacking the wrong target the cancer stem cells remain and the tumor can return months or years later we're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure and we're ending the era of personalized oncology the ability to leverage all this data together analyze the tumor and come up with a real specific cocktail for the individual patient now I'll close with regenerative medicine so I've studied a lot about stem cells embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful we also have adult stem cells throughout our body we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation Geron just last year start of the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries still a phase one trial but evolving we've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics particularly in treating cardiovascular disease if we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack I invented a bicycle the marrow miner a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow it's now been FDA approved and will hopefully be on the market in the next year so hopefully you can appreciate the device that are curving through the patient's body and removing the bone marrow instead of with 200 punctures which is a single puncture under local anesthesia but where stem cell therapy really going if you think about it every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo we can have reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient making your own personalized stem cell lines and I think there'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to you know have in the freezer your own cardiac cells myocytes neural cells to use them in the future should you need them and we're integrating this now with a whole year of cellular engineering and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3d organ that's where things are going to head still very early days but I think as integration of exponential technologies this is the example so enclosed as you think about technology turns on how to impact health and medicine we're entering an era of miniaturization decentralization and personalization and I think by pulling these things together we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these we're going to empower the patient enable the doctor enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick because I know as a doctor if someone comes to me with stage one disease I'm thrilled we can often cure them but often is too late and it's stage three or four cancer for example so by leveraging these technologies together I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call stage zero medicine and as a cancer doctor I'm looking forward to being out of a job thanks very much

**Transcript**:
a couple of years ago when I was attending the TED conference in Long Beach I met Harriet now we'd actually met online before you know not the way you're thinking we were actually introduced because we both knew Linda av one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies and because we shared our genetic information with Linda she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA haplotype K 1 a 1 B 1 a which meant that we were distantly related we actually shared the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman so Ozzie Harriet and me and being the current day of course we start our own Facebook group you're all welcome to join and when I met Harriet and person the next year at the TED conference she'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype t-shirts now why am I telling you this story what does this have to do with the future of health well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bioinformatics to the connection of the internet and social networking what I like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies you know we often think linearly but if you think about it if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day 2 4 8 16 15 days of 32,000 what do you think you have in a month or at a billion so if we start to think exponentially we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us and many of these technologies speaking as a physician and innovator we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of healthcare and to address many of the major challenges that we have in healthcare today ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population the way we really don't use information very well today the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation and one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left we spend most of our money on the last 20% of life what if we get spend and incentivize physicians and healthcare system in our own self to move the curve to left improve our health leveraging technology as well now my favorite technology example of exponential technology we all have in our pocket so if you just think about it these are really dramatically improving I mean this is the iPhone 4 imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do now I've gained some insight into this I've been the track chair for the medicine portion of a new institution called singularity University based in Silicon Valley and we bring together each summer about 100 very talented students from around the world and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine biotech artificial intelligence robotics nanotechnology space and address how could cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals we also have seven-day executive programs and coming up next month is actually future mat a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine now I mentioned the phone these mobile phones have over I think 20,000 different mobile apps available to the point where there's one out of the UK where you can pee in a little chip connect it to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD and I try that yet but that's available there other sorts of applications merging your phone and diagnostics for example measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that Prudential e to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic so let's see now how exponential technologies are taking healthcare let's start with faster well it's no secret that computers through Moore's law are speeding up faster and faster we have the ability to do more powerful things with them they're really approaching in many cases surpassing the ability of the human mind but what I think computational speed is most applicable is that of imaging the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible we're layering multiple technologies PET scan CT scans and molecular diagnostics to find and seek things at different levels here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done to date reconstructed of Bartho - the curator of TEDMED and now we can see inside of the brain at a resolution and ability that was never before available and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even re-engineer or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand pathology disease and therapy we can look at side with real-time fMRI in the brain at real-time and by understanding these sorts of processes in these connections we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective for example psychoactive drugs the scanners for these are getting smaller and less expensive and more portable and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge the scan of today takes up about 800 books or 20 gigabytes the scan of just in a couple years will be one terabyte or 800,000 books how do we leverage the information let's get personal I won't ask you here's how to colonoscopy but if you're over age 50 it's time for your screening colonoscopy how would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick well now there's essentially virtual colonoscopy compare those two pictures and now as the radiologist you can Sochi fly through your patients calling and augmenting that with artificial intelligence identify potential as you see here a lesion that we might have missed it but using AI on top of radiology we can find lesions that were missed before and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise and this is an example this paradigm shift we're moving to this integration of biomedicine information technology wireless and I would say mobile now this era of digital medicine so even my stethoscope is now digital and of course there's an app for that we're moving obviously to the era of the tricorder so the handheld ultrasound is facially surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope these are now at a price point of what used to be a hundred thousand euros or a couple hundred thousand dollars for about five thousand dollars I can have the power with very powerful diagnostic device in my hand and merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records in the United States we're still less than 20% electronic here in the Netherlands I think it's more than 80% but now that we're switching to merging medical data making it available electronically we can crowdsource that information and now as a physician I can access my patients data from wherever I am just through my mobile device and now of course we're in the era of the iPad even the iPad 2 and just last month the first fda-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices so certainly the physicians of the day including myself are completely reliable on these devices and as you saw just about a month ago Watson from IBM beat the two champions in jeopardy so I want you to imagine we're in a couple years we start to apply this cloud-based information well we really have the AI physician and leverage our own brains and connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done RT today you don't need to go to visit your physician in many cases only about 20% of actual visits you need to lay hands on the patient we're now in the era of virtual visits from sort of the Skype type visits you can do with American well to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system the ability to interact

keep you in line we out wireless blood pressure cuffs a whole gamut of these technologies are being put together so instead of wearing these glue G devices we can put on a simple this is developed by colleagues at Stanford called the eye rhythm completely supplants the prior technology and a much lower price point with much more effective 'ti now we're also in the ear today of quantified self consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices like this little Fitbit I can measure my steps my caloric outtake I can get insight to that on a daily basis I can share that with my friends with my physician there's watches coming now that I'll measure your heart rate Zeo sleep monitors all suite of tools that can able get a leverage and have insight into your own health and if we start to integrate this information we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies health and wellness there's even mirrors today I can pick up your pulse rate and I would argue in the future we'll have wearable devices in our clothes modern in ourselves 24/7 and just like we have the OnStar system in cars your red light might go on and once a check engine light it's going to be check your body light and go in and get and take care of and probably in a few years we'll check in to your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you okay for those of you with with kiddos at home how would you like to have the the wireless diaper that sir supports here too much information I think that you might need but it's it's gonna be here now we've heard a lot today about technology and connection and I think actually some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients and take more time and actually do the important

what you're likely to have we can be preventive that prevention can be personalized and more importantly it's going to become increasingly participatory through websites like patients like me or managing your data on a Microsoft Health fault or a Google health leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important so I'll finish up with exponentially better we'd like to get therapies better and more effective now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills what if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that me delayed blood pressure and a single therapy basically cure hypertension this is a new device that essentially is doing that that should be on the market within a year or two how about more targeted therapies for cancer right I'm an oncologist and I know today most of what we give is essentially poison we've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover it cancer stem cells so once it seemed to be really responsible for disease relapse so if you think of cancer as a weed we often can whack the weed away it seems to shrink it often comes back so we're tacking the wrong target the cancer stem cells remain and the tumor can return months or years later we're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure and we're ending the era of personalized oncology the ability to leverage all this data together analyze the tumor and come up with a real specific cocktail for the individual patient now I'll close with regenerative medicine so I've studied a lot about stem cells embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful we also have adult stem cells throughout our body we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation Geron just last year start of the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries still a phase one trial but evolving we've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics particularly in treating cardiovascular disease if we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack I invented a bicycle the marrow miner a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow it's now been FDA approved and will hopefully be on the market in the next year so hopefully you can appreciate the device that are curving through the patient's body and removing the bone marrow instead of with 200 punctures which is a single puncture under local anesthesia but where stem cell therapy really going if you think about it every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo we can have reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient making your own personalized stem cell lines and I think there'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to you know have in the freezer your own cardiac cells myocytes neural cells to use them in the future should you need them and we're integrating this now with a whole year of cellular engineering and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3d organ that's where things are going to head still very early days but I think as integration of exponential technologies this is the example so enclosed as you think about technology turns on how to impact health and medicine we're entering an era of miniaturization decentralization and personalization and I think by pulling these things together we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these we're going to empower the patient enable the doctor enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick because I know as a doctor if someone comes to me with stage one disease I'm thrilled we can often cure them but often is too late and it's stage three or four cancer for example so by leveraging these technologies together I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call stage zero medicine and as a cancer doctor I'm looking forward to being out of a job thanks very much

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] in the past several days I heard people talking about China and also I talked to friends about China and Chinese internet something is very challenging to me I want to make my friends still understand China is complicated so I always want to tell the story like one hand it is there the other hand is that you can't just tell one side story I give you example China is a brick Country Brick country means Brazil Russia India and China this emerging economy really is helping Revival of the world economy but at the same time on the other hand China is a sick country the the terminology calleded by Facebook IPO paper five he said the sick country means Syria Iran China and North Korea the four countries have no access to Facebook so basically China is a sick break country another project was build to watch China and Chinese internet but now now today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past sever years from that war so if you are a fan of the game of thron you definitely know how important a big war for Old Kingdom it prevent weird things from the north same was true for China in the north there was a great War Junction it protect China from Invaders for 2,000 years but China also have a great fire War that's the biggest Digital Boundary in the whole world it's not only to defend Chinese regime from the overc from the universal value but also prevent Chinese own citizen to access the global free internet and even separate themselves into blocks not United so basically internet has two internets one is the internet the other is the China net but if you think the China net is something like a dead land Roost land I think is wrong but we also use very simple metaphor the cat and the mouse game to describe in the past 15 years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship government censorship the cat and the Chinese internet users that mean us the mouse but sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple so today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version in China we have 500 million internet users that's biggest population of natien Internet users in the whole world so if even Chinese is a totally censored internet but still Chinese internet Society is really booming how make it it's simple you have Google we have Buu you have Twitter we have weo you have Facebook we have renen you have YouTube we have yuku and Twitter Chinese government blocked every single International Web Two P services and we Chinese copycat everyone so that's kind of the thing I called SM censorship so that's not only to censor you sometimes that's Chinese National internet policy is very simple block and clone on the one hand he want to satisfy people's need of social network which is very important people really love social networking but on the other hand they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data anytime they want that's also the reason Google was pulled out from China because they can't accept the fact Chinese government want to keep the server sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands for example Mubarak he shut down the internet he want to prevent neens to criticize him but once Nan can't go online they go on street and now the result is very simple we all know Mubarak is technically dead but also Ben Ani Tunisia president didn't follow the second rule that means keep the server in your hand he allowed Facebook a us-based services service to continue stay on inside Tunisia so he can't prevented his own citizens to post critical video against his corruption the same thing happened he was the first to tobert joing the Arab spray but those two very smart you know National censorship policy didn't prevent Chinese social media become a really public spere a b feere of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials because we have 300 million micro bloggers in China is the entire population of United States so when these 300 million people Michel blogger even they block the tweet in a censored platform but itself is China L but it can create very powerful energy which is never happened in the Chinese history 2011 the July two briding trains crashed in wo a sou city right after the train crash authorities literally want to cover up the train bury the train so it's anger the Chinese Naes the first five days after the train crash there were 10 million critism of the posting on the social media which never happened in Chinese history and later later this year the real Minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years and also very recently very funny debate between the Beijing environment Ministry and American Embassy in Beijing because the ministry blame American Embassy for intervening Chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of Beijing so the app is the embassy data the PM 2.5 he show 148 they show is dangerous for sensitive group so suggestion is not good to go outside but the D is the Ministries data he shows 50 he said it's good it's good to go outside but 99% of Chinese micro bloggers stand firmly on the embassy side I live in Beijing every day I just watch the American Embassy data to decide whether I should open my window why Chinese social networking even within the censorship is so boming part of the reason is Chinese languages you know ttor and trt clones have a kind of a limitation 14 characters but in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link maybe in Germany a German language maybe just AA but in Chinese language is really about 140 characters means a paragraph a story you can almost have all the journalistic elements to there for example this is the Hamlet of the Shakespeare the same content one you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets Chinese is always cheating right so because of this Chinese really regard this micro blogging as a media not only headline to media and also the Clone Signal Company is the guy who cloned the Twitter they even has their own name with with weo weo is Chinese translation for mic blog it has owned the Innovation at the commenting area make the Chinese weor more like Facebook rather than original Twitter so these Innovations and clones as the wo and micro blogging when they come to China in 2009 the immediately become the media platform itself it become a media platform of 300 million readers it become the media if anything not mentioned in weo it does not appear to exist for Chinese public but also Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindset and Chinese life for example they give the voiceless people a China to make your voice heard we had a petition system is a remedy outside the judicial system because Chinese central government want to keep a miss the emperor is good but all the local officials are sucks so that's why the petitioner the victims of the pant went to take the train to Beijing to petition to central government want the emperor want to settle the problem but when more and more people go to Beijing they also cause the risk of Revolution so they sent them back recent years and even some of of them would put into black jaar but now we have the weo so I called weo petition people just use the cell phone to tweet so your sad stories by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters professors or celebrities one of that is yaan she's most popular micro blogger in China who has about 21 million followers they're almost like a national TV station if you st sad story will pick up by her so this wo social media even in the censorship still gave Chinese a real chance for 300 million people every day chatting together talking to together it's like a big Tad right but also it is like the first time of public sphere happened in China Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people but also the cat the sensorship is not sleeping it's so hard to post some sensitive words in the Chinese we for for example you can't post the name of the president huin and also you can't post the city of chonging name and until recently you can't search the surname of top top leaders so the Chinese are very good that there palms and alternative wording and even memes the even Nam you know use the name of this world changing batter between the grma horse and River craft grma horse is T it's the photogram for  it's n call River crap is is the phonogram for harmonization for sensorship so that's kind of Aima versus the her that's very good but so that's in when some very political exciting moment happened you can see on the way you still a lot of very weird stories happened weird phrases and words even you have a PhD of Chinese language you can't understand them but you can you expect more no because Chinese signal weor one he was funded is exactly one month after the official blocking of twitter.com that means from the very beginning the weor already has already convinced the Chinese government we will not be become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime for example anything you want to post like get together or meet up or work it will automatically will recorded and data mined and reported to a pool for further an political analysing even you want to have some gathering before you go there the place is already waiting for you why because they have the data they have everything in their hand so so they you can they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the disident so the Crackdown is very serious but I want you notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse the cat is the censorship but Chinese is not only one cat but I also have local cats Central cat and local cats you know server is in the local cat's hands so it let when the Nan criticize local government local government has no any access of the data in Beijing without bribing the central cast he can do nothing only apologize so this three year in the past three years social movement about micro blogging really changed local government they can more become more and more transparent because they can't access the data the server is in Beijing the story about TR crash maybe the question is not about why 10 million criticism in 5 days but why Chinese central government allow the five days of freedom of speech online it never happened before answer is very simple because even the top leaders was fed up with this guy this independent Kingdom so they want excuse so public opinion is very good excuse to punish him but also the Bosa case recently very big news he's princeling but in from the febrary to the April in this year W really become a Marketplace of rumors you can almost joke everything about this princelings everything it's almost you are living in the United States but if you dare to retreat or mention any fake coup about Beijing in Beijing you definitely will be arrested so this kind of freedom is targeted and precise window so Chinese in China censorship is normal something you find is freedom is weird something will happen behind because he was very popular leftist leader so central government want to purge him they need very cute to convince the all the Chinese people why he's so bad so the the wayo 300 million public sphere become very good convenient tour for political fight but this technology is very new but technique is very old it made Famous by chairman ma maon because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the cultural revolution to destroy every local government it's very simple because Chinese central government don't need even lead the public opinion they just give them a Target window no censor people not censoring in China become a political toour so that's the update about this game cat and the mouse social media change Chinese mindset more and more chinesee intend to embrace freedom speech and human rights as their Birthright not some important American privilege but also it gave Chinese a national public Sphere for people to it's like a training of their citizenship preparing for the future democracy but it didn't change Chinese political system and also Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen his power to control the local government and the different factions so what's the future but after all we are the mouse whatever the future is we should fight against the mouse there is not only in China but also in the United States there are know some very small cute but bad cats so P ecta TPP and itu you and also like Facebook and the Google they claim they are friends of the mouse but sometimes we see them dating with the cats so my conclusion is very simple we Chinese fight our for our freedom you just watch your bad cats don't let them to hook with the Chinese cats only in this in the future we will achieve achieve the dreams of the mouse that we can can treat anytime anywhere without fear thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] in the past several days I heard people talking about China and also I talked to friends about China and Chinese internet something is very challenging to me I want to make my friends still understand China is complicated so I always want to tell the story like one hand it is there the other hand is that you can't just tell one side story I give you example China is a brick Country Brick country means Brazil Russia India and China this emerging economy really is helping Revival of the world economy but at the same time on the other hand China is a sick country the the terminology calleded by Facebook IPO paper five he said the sick country means Syria Iran China and North Korea the four countries have no access to Facebook so basically China is a sick break country another project was build to watch China and Chinese internet but now now today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past sever years from that war so if you are a fan of the game of thron you definitely know how important a big war for Old Kingdom it prevent weird things from the north same was true for China in the north there was a great War Junction it protect China from Invaders for 2,000 years but China also have a great fire War that's the biggest Digital Boundary in the whole world it's not only to defend Chinese regime from the overc from the universal value but also prevent Chinese own citizen to access the global free internet and even separate themselves into blocks not United so basically internet has two internets one is the internet the other is the China net but if you think the China net is something like a dead land Roost land I think is wrong but we also use very simple metaphor the cat and the mouse game to describe in the past 15 years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship government censorship the cat and the Chinese internet users that mean us the mouse but sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple so today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version in China we have 500 million internet users that's biggest population of natien Internet users in the whole world so if even Chinese is a totally censored internet but still Chinese internet Society is really booming how make it it's simple you have Google we have Buu you have Twitter we have weo you have Facebook we have renen you have YouTube we have yuku and Twitter Chinese government blocked every single International Web Two P services and we Chinese copycat everyone so that's kind of the thing I called SM censorship so that's not only to censor you sometimes that's Chinese National internet policy is very simple block and clone on the one hand he want to satisfy people's need of social network which is very important people really love social networking but on the other hand they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data anytime they want that's also the reason Google was pulled out from China because they can't accept the fact Chinese government want to keep the server sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands for example Mubarak he shut down the internet he want to prevent neens to criticize him but once Nan can't go online they go on street and now the result is very simple we all know Mubarak is technically dead but also Ben Ani Tunisia president didn't follow the second rule that means keep the server in your hand he allowed Facebook a us-based services service to continue stay on inside Tunisia so he can't prevented his own citizens to post critical video against his corruption the same thing happened he was the first to tobert joing the Arab spray but those two very smart you know National censorship policy didn't prevent Chinese social media become a really public spere a b feere of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials because we have 300 million micro bloggers in China is the entire population of United States so when these 300 million people Michel blogger even they block the tweet in a censored platform but itself is China L but it can create very powerful energy which is never happened in the Chinese history 2011 the July two briding trains crashed in wo a sou city right after the train crash authorities literally want to cover up the train bury the train so it's anger the Chinese Naes the first five days after the train crash there were 10 million critism of the posting on the social media which never happened in Chinese history and later later this year the real Minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years and also very recently very funny debate between the Beijing environment Ministry and American Embassy in Beijing because the ministry blame American Embassy for intervening Chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of Beijing so the app is the embassy data the PM 2.5 he show 148 they show is dangerous for sensitive group so suggestion is not good to go outside but the D is the Ministries data he shows 50 he said it's good it's good to go outside but 99% of Chinese micro bloggers stand firmly on the embassy side I live in Beijing every day I just watch the American Embassy data to decide whether I should open my window why Chinese social networking even within the censorship is so boming part of the reason is Chinese languages you know ttor and trt clones have a kind of a limitation 14 characters but in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link maybe in Germany a German language maybe just AA but in Chinese language is really about 140 characters means a paragraph a story you can almost have all the journalistic elements to there for example this is the Hamlet of the Shakespeare the same content one you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets Chinese is always cheating right so because of this Chinese really regard this micro blogging as a media not only headline to media and also the Clone Signal Company is the guy who cloned the Twitter they even has their own name with with weo weo is Chinese translation for mic blog it has owned the Innovation at the commenting area make the Chinese weor more like Facebook rather than original Twitter so these Innovations and clones as the wo and micro blogging when they come to China in 2009 the immediately become the media platform itself it become a media platform of 300 million readers it become the media if anything not mentioned in weo it does not appear to exist for Chinese public but also Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindset and Chinese life for example they give the voiceless people a China to make your voice heard we had a petition system is a remedy outside the judicial system because Chinese central government want to keep a miss the emperor is good but all the local officials are sucks so that's why the petitioner the victims of the pant went to take the train to Beijing to petition to central government want the emperor want to settle the problem but when more and more people go to Beijing they also cause the risk of Revolution so they sent them back recent years and even some of of them would put into black jaar but now we have the weo so I called weo petition people just use the cell phone to tweet so your sad stories by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters professors or celebrities one of that is yaan she's most popular micro blogger in China who has about 21 million followers they're almost like a national TV station if you st sad story will pick up by her so this wo social media even in the censorship still gave Chinese a real chance for 300 million people every day chatting together talking to together it's like a big Tad right but also it is like the first time of public sphere happened in China Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people but also the cat the sensorship is not sleeping it's so hard to post some sensitive words in the Chinese we for for example you can't post the name of the president huin and also you can't post the city of chonging name and until recently you can't search the surname of top top leaders so the Chinese are very good that there palms and alternative wording and even memes the even Nam you know use the name of this world changing batter between the grma horse and River craft grma horse is T it's the photogram for  it's n call River crap is is the phonogram for harmonization for sensorship so that's kind of Aima versus the her that's very good but so that's in when some very political exciting moment happened you can see on the way you still a lot of very weird stories happened weird phrases and words even you have a PhD of Chinese language you can't understand them but you can you expect more no because Chinese signal weor one he was funded is exactly one month after the official blocking of twitter.com that means from the very beginning the weor already has already convinced the Chinese government we will not be become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime for example anything you want to post like get together or meet up or work it will automatically will recorded and data mined and reported to a pool for further an political analysing even you want to have some gathering before you go there the place is already waiting for you why because they have the data they have everything in their hand so so they you can they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the disident so the Crackdown is very serious but I want you notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse the cat is the censorship but Chinese is not only one cat but I also have local cats Central cat and local cats you know server is in the local cat's hands so it let when the Nan criticize local government local government has no any access of the data in Beijing without bribing the central cast he can do nothing only apologize so this three year in the past three years social movement about micro blogging really changed local government they can more become more and more transparent because they can't access the data the server is in Beijing the story about TR crash maybe the question is not about why 10 million criticism in 5 days but why Chinese central government allow the five days of freedom of speech online it never happened before answer is very simple because even the top leaders was fed up with this guy this independent Kingdom so they want excuse so public opinion is very good excuse to punish him but also the Bosa case recently very big news he's princeling but in from the febrary to the April in this year W really become a Marketplace of rumors you can almost joke everything about this princelings everything it's almost you are living in the United States but if you dare to retreat or mention any fake coup about Beijing in Beijing you definitely will be arrested so this kind of freedom is targeted and precise window so Chinese in China censorship is normal something you find is freedom is weird something will happen behind because he was very popular leftist leader so central government want to purge him they need very cute to convince the all the Chinese people why he's so bad so the the wayo 300 million public sphere become very good convenient tour for political fight but this technology is very new but technique is very old it made Famous by chairman ma maon because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the cultural revolution to destroy every local government it's very simple because Chinese central government don't need even lead the public opinion they just give them a Target window no censor people not censoring in China become a political toour so that's the update about this game cat and the mouse social media change Chinese mindset more and more chinesee intend to embrace freedom speech and human rights as their Birthright not some important American privilege but also it gave Chinese a national public Sphere for people to it's like a training of their citizenship preparing for the future democracy but it didn't change Chinese political system and also Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen his power to control the local government and the different factions so what's the future but after all we are the mouse whatever the future is we should fight against

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] in the past several days I heard people talking about China and also I talked to friends about China and Chinese internet something is very challenging to me I want to make my friends still understand China is complicated so I always want to tell the story like one hand it is there the other hand is that you can't just tell one side story I give you example China is a brick Country Brick country means Brazil Russia India and China this emerging economy really is helping Revival of the world economy but at the same time on the other hand China is a sick country the the terminology calleded by Facebook IPO paper five he said the sick country means Syria Iran China and North Korea the four countries have no access to Facebook so basically China is a sick break country another project was build to watch China and Chinese internet but now now today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past sever years from that war so if you are a fan of the game of thron you definitely know how important a big war for Old Kingdom it prevent weird things from the north same was true for China in the north there was a great War Junction it protect China from Invaders for 2,000 years but China also have a great fire War that's the biggest Digital Boundary in the whole world it's not only to defend Chinese regime from the overc from the universal value but also prevent Chinese own citizen to access the global free internet and even separate themselves into blocks not United so basically internet has two internets one is the internet the other is the China net but if you think the China net is something like a dead land Roost land I think is wrong but we also use very simple metaphor the cat and the mouse game to describe in the past 15 years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship government censorship the cat and the Chinese internet users that mean us the mouse but sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple so today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version in China we have 500 million internet users that's biggest population of natien Internet users in the whole world so if even Chinese is a totally censored internet but still Chinese internet Society is really booming how make it it's simple you have Google we have Buu you have Twitter we have weo you have Facebook we have renen you have YouTube we have yuku and Twitter Chinese government blocked every single International Web Two P services and we Chinese copycat everyone so that's kind of the thing I called SM censorship so that's not only to censor you sometimes that's Chinese National internet policy is very simple block and clone on the one hand he want to satisfy people's need of social network which is very important people really love social networking but on the other hand they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data anytime they want that's also the reason Google was pulled out from China because they can't accept the fact Chinese government want to keep the server sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands for example Mubarak he shut down the internet he want to prevent neens to criticize him but once Nan can't go online they go on street and now the result is very simple we all know Mubarak is technically dead but also Ben Ani Tunisia president didn't follow the second rule that means keep the server in your hand he allowed Facebook a us-based services service to continue stay on inside Tunisia so he can't prevented his own citizens to post critical video against his corruption the same thing happened he was the first to tobert joing the Arab spray but those two very smart you know National censorship policy didn't prevent Chinese social media become a really public spere a b feere of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials because we have 300 million micro bloggers in China is the entire population of United States so when these 300 million people Michel blogger even they block the tweet in a censored platform but itself is China L but it can create very powerful energy which is never happened in the Chinese history 2011 the July two briding trains crashed in wo a sou city right after the train crash authorities literally want to cover up the train bury the train so it's anger the Chinese Naes the first five days after the train crash there were 10 million critism of the posting on the social media which never happened in Chinese history and later later this year the real Minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years and also very recently very funny debate between the Beijing environment Ministry and American Embassy in Beijing because the ministry blame American Embassy for intervening Chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of Beijing so the app is the embassy data the PM 2.5 he show 148 they show is dangerous for sensitive group so suggestion is not good to go outside but the D is the Ministries data he shows 50 he said it's good it's good to go outside but 99% of Chinese micro bloggers stand firmly on the embassy side I live in Beijing every day I just watch the American Embassy data to decide whether I should open my window why Chinese social networking even within the censorship is so boming part of the reason is Chinese languages you know ttor and trt clones have a kind of a limitation 14 characters but in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link maybe in Germany a German language maybe just AA but in Chinese language is really about 140 characters means a paragraph a story you can almost have all the journalistic elements to there for example this is the Hamlet of the Shakespeare the same content one you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets Chinese is always cheating right so because of this Chinese really regard this micro blogging as a media not only headline to media and also the Clone Signal Company is the guy who cloned the Twitter they even has their own name with with weo weo is Chinese translation for mic blog it has owned the Innovation at the commenting area make the Chinese weor more like Facebook rather than original Twitter so these Innovations and clones as the wo and micro blogging when they come to China in 2009 the immediately become the media platform itself it become a media platform of 300 million readers it become the media if anything not mentioned in weo it does not appear to exist for Chinese public but also Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindset and Chinese life for example they give the voiceless people a China to make your voice heard we had a petition system is a remedy outside the judicial system because Chinese central government want to keep a miss the emperor is good but all the local officials are sucks so that's why the petitioner the victims of the pant went to take the train to Beijing to petition to central government want the emperor want to settle the problem but when more and more people go to Beijing they also cause the risk of Revolution so they sent them back recent years and even some of of them would put into black jaar but now we have the weo so I called weo petition people just use the cell phone to tweet so your sad stories by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters professors or celebrities one of that is yaan she's most popular micro blogger in China who has about 21 million followers they're almost like a national TV station if you st sad story will pick up by her so this wo social media even in the censorship still gave Chinese a real chance for 300 million people every day chatting together talking to together it's like a big Tad right but also it is like the first time of public sphere happened in China Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people but also the cat the sensorship is not sleeping it's so hard to post some sensitive words in the Chinese we for for example you can't post the name of the president huin and also you can't post the city of chonging name and until recently you can't search the surname of top top leaders so the Chinese are very good that there palms and alternative wording and even memes the even Nam you know use the name of this world changing batter between the grma horse and River craft grma horse is T it's the photogram for  it's n call River crap is is the phonogram for harmonization for sensorship so that's kind of Aima versus the her that's very good but so that's in when some very political exciting moment happened you can see on the way you still a lot of very weird stories happened weird phrases and words even you have a PhD of Chinese language you can't understand them but you can you expect more no because Chinese signal weor one he was funded is exactly one month after the official blocking of twitter.com that means from the very beginning the weor already has already convinced the Chinese government we will not be become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime for example anything you want to post like get together or meet up or work it will automatically will recorded and data mined and reported to a pool for further an political analysing even you want to have some gathering before you go there the place is already waiting for you why because they have the data they have everything in their hand so so they you can they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the disident so the Crackdown is very serious but I want you notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse the cat is the censorship but Chinese is not only one cat but I also have local cats Central cat and local cats you know server is in the local cat's hands so it let when the Nan criticize local government local government has no any access of the data in Beijing without bribing the central cast he can do nothing only apologize so this three year in the past three years social movement about micro blogging really changed local government they can more become more and more transparent because they can't access the data the server is in Beijing the story about TR crash maybe the question is not about why 10 million criticism in 5 days but why Chinese central government allow the five days of freedom of speech online it never happened before answer is very simple because even the top leaders was fed up with this guy this independent Kingdom so they want excuse so public opinion is very good excuse to punish him but also the Bosa case recently very big news he's princeling but in from the febrary to the April in this year W really become a Marketplace of rumors you can almost joke everything about this princelings everything it's almost you are living in the United States but if you dare to retreat or mention any fake coup about Beijing in Beijing you definitely will be arrested so this kind of freedom is targeted and precise window so Chinese in China censorship is normal something you find is freedom is weird something will happen behind because he was very popular leftist leader so central government want to purge him they need very cute to convince the all the Chinese people why he's so bad so the the wayo 300 million public sphere become very good convenient tour for political fight but this technology is very new but technique is very old it made Famous by chairman ma maon because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the cultural revolution to destroy every local government it's very simple because Chinese central government don't need even lead the public opinion they just give them a Target window no censor people not censoring in China become a political toour so that's the update about this game cat and the mouse social media change Chinese mindset more and more chinesee intend to embrace freedom speech and human rights as their Birthright not some important American privilege but also it gave Chinese a national public Sphere for people to it's like a training of their citizenship preparing for the future democracy but it didn't change Chinese political system and also Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen his power to control the local government and the different factions so what's the future but after all we are the mouse whatever the future is we should fight against the mouse there is not only in China but also in the United States there are know some very small cute but bad cats so P ecta TPP and itu you and also like Facebook and the Google they claim they are friends of the mouse but sometimes we see them dating with the cats so my conclusion is very simple we Chinese fight our for our freedom you just watch your bad cats don't let them to hook with the Chinese cats only in this in the future we will achieve achieve the dreams of the mouse that we can can treat anytime anywhere without fear thank you

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: Gorgeous, beautiful or very attractive. The source of the word gorgeous can be found in the Latin word, gurges, used by the Romans to describe a whirling, swirling whirlpool. Thanks to the aquatic phenomenon's cylindrical shape and gurgling form, gurges also came to mean throat. By the time gurges reached England in the 14th century, it had been altered to gorge. This, to the English, seemed like an appropriate way to describe a steep and rocky ravine, a metaphorical extension of the words referenced to the throat. The French, however, transformed gorge into gorgias and used it to describe one of the most fashionable trends of the Middle Ages, also known as a wimple. This popular article of clothing revealed only the madame's visage, covering her shoulders, head, and, of course, her throat . A stylish and intricate gorgias was so telling of class and affluence that the word soon came to mean fond of dress and elegant. This newly fashioned adjective voyaged into Middle English as gorgayse, where it was fully anglicized as gorgeous. Since then, it has been linked to all things of exceptionally graceful allure.

**Transcript**:
Would you believe that walruses, rattlesnakes, and parakeets all once lived in the same house? Let's go back about 350 million years. Look around. Steamy swamps and rain forests
of horsetails and ferns cover the region. Amphibians are the dominant
land vertebrates. They range in size from newts to crocodiles. And all require water
to do their egg laying. If they don't go to the water, their shell-less, jelly-like
eggs will dry out. Because of this hazard, they spend most of their time living in or near fresh water. That is, until a breakthrough in evolution changes everything: the amniotic egg. The amniotic egg is shelled, waterproof, and can be laid on dry land. It is produced by the amniotes, a new group of animals named
after their revolutionary egg. The first amniote is a tetrapod, a four-legged animal, resembling a small lizard. While some amphibians
can walk around on land and bury their eggs in wet
soil or highly humid areas, nothing before the amniotes
has the ability to lay its eggs on completely dry land. Because of this evolved egg, the amniotes are the first animals with the ability to live
a fully terrestrial life. But, despite their move inland, the amniotes have not abandoned their pond-dwelling upbringing. In fact, the amniotic egg
brings the pond with them by enclosing the aquatic
environment within its shell. This is achieved by four main upgrades that are unique to amniotic eggs. Let's take a closer look. The first development is the most obvious: the egg's protective shell. It's tough but flexible, and has a leathery surface, still seen in reptile eggs today. The shell protects
the eggs from predators, bacteria, damage, and drying out. But, unlike the walls of a fish tank, the shell of the amniotic egg is porous, allowing oxygen to pass through so that the growing amniote
inside doesn't suffocate. The next two developments
are two separate membranes that work together like a pair of lungs. They bring oxygen into the embryo while removing carbon dioxide. The first is the chorion, which is the protective layer
that oxygen passes through after entering the shell's tiny pores. You may recognize the chorion as the thin skin you peel
away on a hard boiled egg. Think of this waterproof membrane as the in and out doors of the egg. It's the entrance for oxygen and exit for carbon dioxide. The membrane working with the chorion is the allantois. If the chorion is the doors, then the allantois is essentially
the lobby of the building. It directs the oxygen and carbon dioxide while simultaneously storing unneeded waste from the embryo. The chorion and the allantois
make sure the embryo has everything it needs and gets rid of anything it doesn't. The last and perhaps
the most important development is the amnion, the membrane
for which the egg is named. The amnion is also contained
within the chroion and holds the fluid
in which the embryo floats. Because it has left the watery
world of the amphibians, the amnion is necessary for preventing the embryo from drying out. It is the transportable pond that allows the amniote
to lay the egg on dry land. Its fluid also protects the embryo from any collisions or rough landings, like a shock absorber on your bike or car. Together, the shell
and these four membranes create a safe, watery environment for the embryo to grow and develop. The new amniote offspring will continue the process of vertebrate evolution as it explores new land
away from the water. They will spend the next million years splitting into two distinct groups: the synapsids and sauropsids. Synapsida is the group of animals that contain mammals, while sauropsida
is the group that contains reptiles, birds, and dinosaurs. These two amniotic groups
collectively contain the walruses, rattlesnakes, and parakeets we know today. Like a family reunion, with relatives of every shape and size, coming together from different
corners of the Earth, these animals can all call one place home: the amniotic egg.

**Transcript**:
Would you believe that walruses, rattlesnakes, and parakeets all once lived in the same house? Let's go back about 350 million years. Look around. Steamy swamps and rain forests
of horsetails and ferns cover the region. Amphibians are the dominant
land vertebrates. They range in size from newts to crocodiles. And all require water
to do their egg laying. If they don't go to the water, their shell-less, jelly-like
eggs will dry out. Because of this hazard, they spend most of their time living in or near fresh water. That is, until a breakthrough in evolution changes everything: the amniotic egg. The amniotic egg is shelled, waterproof, and can be laid on dry land. It is produced by the amniotes, a new group of animals named
after their revolutionary egg. The first amniote is a tetrapod, a four-legged animal, resembling a small lizard. While some amphibians
can walk around on land and bury their eggs in wet
soil or highly humid areas, nothing before the amniotes
has the ability to lay its eggs on completely dry land. Because of this evolved egg, the amniotes are the first animals with the ability to live
a fully terrestrial life. But, despite their move inland, the amniotes have not abandoned their pond-dwelling upbringing. In fact, the amniotic egg
brings the pond with them by enclosing the aquatic
environment within its shell. This is achieved by four main upgrades that are unique to amniotic eggs. Let's take a closer look. The first development is the most obvious: the egg's protective shell. It's tough but flexible, and has a leathery surface, still seen in reptile eggs today. The shell protects
the eggs from predators, bacteria, damage, and drying out. But, unlike the walls of a fish tank, the shell of the amniotic egg is porous, allowing oxygen to pass through so that the growing amniote
inside doesn't suffocate. The next two developments
are two separate membranes that work together like a pair of lungs. They bring oxygen into the embryo while removing carbon dioxide. The first is the chorion, which is the protective layer
that oxygen passes through after entering the shell's tiny pores. You may recognize the chorion as the thin skin you peel
away on a hard boiled egg. Think of this waterproof membrane as the in and out doors of the egg. It's the entrance for oxygen and exit for carbon dioxide. The membrane working with the chorion is the allantois. If the chorion is the doors, then the allantois is essentially
the lobby of the building. It directs the oxygen and carbon dioxide while simultaneously storing unneeded waste from the embryo. The chorion and the allantois
make sure the embryo has everything it needs and gets rid of anything it doesn't. The last and perhaps
the most important development is the amnion, the membrane
for which the egg is named. The amnion is also contained
within the chroion and holds the fluid
in which the embryo floats. Because it has left the watery
world of the amphibians, the amnion is necessary for preventing the embryo from drying out. It is the transportable pond that allows the amniote
to lay the egg on dry land. Its fluid also protects the embryo from any collisions or rough landings, like a shock absorber on your bike or car. Together, the shell
and these four membranes create a safe, watery environment for the embryo to grow and develop. The new amniote offspring will continue the process of vertebrate evolution as it explores new land
away from the water. They will spend the next million years splitting into two distinct groups: the synapsids and sauropsids. Synapsida is the group of animals that contain mammals, while sauropsida
is the group that contains reptiles, birds, and dinosaurs. These two amniotic groups
collectively contain the walruses, rattlesnakes, and parakeets we know today. Like a family reunion, with relatives of every shape and size, coming together from different
corners of the Earth, these animals can all call one place home: the amniotic egg.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Around 1469, a wealthy money changer commissioned a young painter named Sandro Botticelli to paint an altar piece. Botticelli would, of course, become known as one of the greatest painters of the High Renaissance, producing works like "La Primavera" and "The Birth of Venus." But, in 1469, he had not yet earned this reputation. The scene this young artist set out to paint was well-known: the Three Wise Men, or Magi, arriving at the birth place of Jesus Christ. Botticelli would aspire to take this common theme and produce an entirely original work, while asserting himself among the most important citizens of Florence. Many earlier paintings illustrate the Magi arriving at a stable, stately manger, fitting for the son of God. The young Botticelli, however, chose to place the scene in the dilapidated Roman ruin. At the center of this structure, he placed a sturdy rock for Mary and Jesus to sit high above their visitors. With this decision, Botticelli seemed to say Christianity will be built on sturdier stuff than Rome. Botticelli then populated the space with important men from his city. On the right side, he paints the man who paid for this work, Gaspare del Lama, looking out at the viewer and confidently pointing at himself so that there is no question who is responsible for this masterpiece. Though born the son of a barber, del Lama amassed a good sum of money through currency exchange in his lifetime. He earned enough money to buy a burial chapel and decorate it with a pretty painting. The Three Wise Men appear at the center of this painting, kneeling to Mary and Jesus. As models for these important figures, Botticelli used members of the important Medici family. Del Lama's career as a money changer would not have been possible without the help of the powerful Medici family, in particular Cosimo de' Medici, who appears prominently at Mary's feet. The other wise men can be identified as Piero and Giovanni de' Medici, Cosimo's two sons. The business of money exchange had dubious ethical and legal associations, so the friendship of this powerful family was important. And the young heir to Medici power, Lorenzo, could not be omitted from this painting's composition. He appears to the left of the manger. This painting seems to say the Medici legacy, with its many healthy heirs, will be built on sturdier stuff than Rome. Botticelli then filled the rest of the space with other friends and powerful figures from Florence. And, among the Florentine elite, the young, confident artist painted himself looking directly at the viewer. Botticelli's presence in this painting illustrates a radical shift in the perception of artists during this time period. Botticelli did not view himself as a common craftsman hired for a simple job. He viewed himself as a friend to the powerful families of Florence. Paintings like "The Adoration of the Magi" reveal much more than a simple retelling of a biblical story. They can tell the story of, among other things, a modestly-born money changer attempting to spend his money virtuously by making a local chapel more beautiful, or the story of an ambitious young painter, elevating the reputation of his craft to stand among the wealthy elite of his city.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Which of these is a reason Guasparre del Lama commissioned Botticelli?
Options: A. Botticelli was a famous painter, and he wanted to be associated with that kind of genius, B. To commemorate the birth of his child, C. To commemorate himself inside a personal chapel at a local church

**Transcript**:
I'd like to tell you about two games of chess the first happened in 1997 which Garry Kasparov a human lost a deep-blue a machine to many this was the dawn of a new era one where man would be dominated by machine but here we are 20 years on and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the iPad not how the second game was a freestyle chess tournament in 2005 and which man and machine could enter together as partners rather than adversaries if they so chose at first the results were predictable even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster with a relatively weak laptop the surprise came at the end who won not a grandmaster with the supercomputer but actually two American amateurs using three relatively weak laptops their ability to coach and manipulate their computers to deeply explore specific positions effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge of the grandmasters in the superior computational power of other adversaries this is an astonishing result average men average machines beating the best man the best machine and anyways isn't it supposed to be man versus machine instead it's about cooperation and the right type of cooperation we've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years it's a sexy vision for sure many of embraces become the dominant school of thought computer science but as we enter the era of big data of network systems of open platforms and embedded technology I'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time I'm talking about JCR Licklider z' human-computer symbiosis perhaps better termed intelligence augmentation I a wick lighter was a computer science Titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology in the Internet his vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate in making decisions in controlling complex situations without the inflexible dependence on predetermined programs note that word cooperate Lickliter encourages us to take a toaster and make it data from Star Trek but to take a human and make her more capable humans are so amazing how we think our nonlinear approaches our creativity iterative hypotheses all very difficult if possible all for computers to do Lickliter intuitively realized this contemplating humans setting the goals formulating the hypotheses determining the criteria and performing the evaluation of course in other ways humans are so limited were terrible at scale computation and volume we require high-end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing Licklider for saw computers doing all of the routinize herbal work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision-making silently without much fanfare this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess protein folding a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe this is a world-changing problem with huge implications for our ability to understand and treat disease and for this task supercomputer fueled brute force simply isn't enough fully a game created by computer scientists illustrates the value of the approach non technical non biologists amateurs play a video game in which they visually arranged the structure of the protein allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues this approach beats supercomputers 50% of the time and tied 30% of the time folded recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure of the Mason Fischer monkey virus a protease that had eluded determination for ever 10 years was solved by three players in a matter of days perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing the video game last year on the side of the twin towers a 9/11 memorial opened it displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called meaningful adjacency places the names and next to each other based on the relationships to one another friends families co-workers when you put it all together it's quite a computational challenge 3,500 victims 1,800 to JCCC requests the importance of the overall physical specifications in the final aesthetics when first reported by the media full credit for such a feat was given to an algorithm from the New York City design firm local projects the truth is a bit more nuanced while an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework humans use that framework to design the final result so in this case a computer I've evaluated millions of possible layouts manage a complex relational system and kept track of a very large set of measurements and variables allowing the humans to focus on design and compositional choices so the more you look around you the more you see Licklider vision everywhere whether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car or human-computer symbiosis is making us more capable so if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis what can you do you can start by designing the human into the process instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem design the solution around what the human will do as well when you do this you'll quickly realize that you spend all of your time on the interface between man and machine specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction in fact this friction is more important than the power of the man or the power of the machine in determining overall capability that's why two amateurs with a few laptops handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster what Kasparov calls processes a byproduct of friction the better the process the less the friction and minimizing friction turns out to be this isof variable or take another example Big Data every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever-growing array of sensors your phone credit card computer the result is big data and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition the major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on how do I store this data how do I search this data how do i process this data these are necessary but insufficient questions the imperative is not to figure out how to compute but what to compute how do you impose human intuition on data at this scale again we start by designing the human to the process when PayPal was first starting as a business their biggest challenge was not how do I send money back and forth online it was how do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime why so challenging because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns they can't learn to do that based on patterns they've never seen before an organized crime has a lot in common with this audience brilliant people relentlessly resourceful entrepreneurial spirit and one huge and important difference purpose and so while computers alone can catch all about the cleverest fraudsters catching the cleverest it's the difference between success and failure there's a whole class of problems like this ones with adaptive adversaries they rarely if ever present with the repeatable pattern that's discernable to computers instead there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption and increasingly these problems are buried in big data for example terrorism terrorists are always adapting in minor and major ways to new circumstances and despite what you might see on TV these adaptations and the detection of them are fundamentally human computers don't detect novel patterns or new behaviors or humans do humans using technology testing hypotheses searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence he was caught by dedicated resourceful brilliant people in partnerships with various technologies as appealing as it might sound you cannot algorithmically data-mine your way to the answer there is no find terrorists button and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems the less effective data mining can be instead people will have to look at data and search for insight and as Licklider foresaw long ago the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation and as Kasparov realized that means minimizing friction at the interface now this approach makes possible things like combing through all available data from very different sources identifying key relationships and putting of that in one place something that's been nearly impossible to do before the salm this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications to others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance that must be acknowledged and they can't be swept aside even with the best of intense so let's explore through a couple of examples the impact that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis have had in recent time in October 2007 US and coalition forces raided an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar on the Syrian border of Iraq they found a treasure trove of documents 700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters these foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf the Levant in North Africa to join al-qaeda in Iraq these records were human resource forms the foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization it turns out that al-qaeda too is not without its bureaucracy they answered questions like who recruited you what's your hometown what occupation do you seek and that last question a surprising insight was revealed the vast majority of foreign fighters were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom hugely important since between 2003 and 2007 Iraq had thirteen hundred and eighty two suicide bombings a major source of instability analyzing this data was hard the originals were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated the friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational timeframe using humans PDFs and tenacity alone the researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper to explore non-obvious hypotheses and in fact insights emerged 20% of the foreign fighters were from Libya 50% of those from a single town in Libya hugely important since prior statistics but that figure at 3% it also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in Al Quaida Abu Yahya al-libi a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group in March of 2007 he gave a speech after worship was a surge and participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters perhaps most clever of all though and least obvious by flipping the data on its head the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria that were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border these were networks of mercenaries not ideologues who were in the coordination business for profit for example they charged Saudi foreign fighters substantially more than Libyans money that would have otherwise gone to al Qaeda perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they were cheating would-be jihadists in January 2010 a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti third deadliest earthquake of all time left 1 million people 10% of the population homeless one seemingly small aspect of the overall relief ever became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water soccer rolling January and February the dry months in Haiti yet many of the camps had developed standing water the only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's floodplains had been leveled in the earthquake leadership inside so the question is which camps are at risk how many people in these camps what's the timeline for flooding and give it very limited resources infrastructure how do we prioritize the relocation the data was incredibly disparate US Army had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country there was data online from a 2006 environmental risk conference others geospatial data not have been integrated the human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need the computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospatial information social media data and relief organization information to answer this question by implementing a superior process what was otherwise a task for 40 people over three months became a simple job for three people in 40 hours all victories for human-computer symbiosis were more than 50 years into lick lighters vision for the future and the data suggest that we should be quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems man and machine in cooperation together thank you

think our nonlinear approaches our creativity iterative hypotheses all very difficult if possible all for computers to do Lickliter intuitively realized this contemplating humans setting the goals formulating the hypotheses determining the criteria and performing the evaluation of course in other ways humans are so limited were terrible at scale computation and volume we require high-end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing Licklider for saw computers doing all of the routinize herbal work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision-making silently without much fanfare this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess protein folding a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe this is a world-changing problem with huge implications for our ability to understand and treat disease and for this task supercomputer fueled brute force simply isn't enough fully a game created by computer scientists illustrates the value of the approach non technical non biologists amateurs play a video game in which they visually arranged the structure of the protein allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues this approach beats supercomputers 50% of the time and tied 30% of the time folded recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure of the Mason Fischer monkey virus a protease that had eluded determination for ever 10 years was solved by three players in a matter of days perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing the video game last year on the side of the twin towers a 9/11 memorial opened it displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called meaningful adjacency places the names and next to each other based on the relationships to one another friends families co-workers when you put it all together it's quite a computational challenge 3,500 victims 1,800 to JCCC requests the importance of the overall physical specifications in the final aesthetics when first reported by the media full credit for such a feat was given to an algorithm from the New York City design firm local projects the truth is a bit more nuanced while an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework humans use that framework to design the final result so in this case a computer I've evaluated millions of possible layouts manage a complex relational system and kept track of a very large set of measurements and variables allowing the humans to focus on design and compositional choices so the more you look around you the more you see Licklider vision everywhere whether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car or human-computer symbiosis is making us more capable so if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis what can you do you can start by designing the human into the process instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem design the solution around what the human will do as well when you do this you'll quickly realize that you spend all of your time on the interface between man and machine specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction in fact this friction is more important than the power of the man or the power of the machine in determining overall capability that's why two amateurs with a few laptops handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster what Kasparov calls processes a byproduct of friction the better the process the less the friction and minimizing friction turns out to be this isof variable or take another example Big Data every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever-growing array of sensors your phone credit card computer the result is big data and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition the major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on how do I store this data how do I search this data how do i process this data these are necessary but insufficient questions the imperative is not to figure out how to compute but what to compute how do you impose human intuition on data at this scale again we start by designing the human to the process when PayPal was first starting as a business their biggest challenge was not how do I send money back and forth online it was how do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime why so challenging because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns they can't learn to do that based on patterns they've never seen before an organized crime has a lot in common with this audience brilliant people relentlessly resourceful entrepreneurial spirit and one huge and important difference purpose and so while computers alone can catch all about the cleverest fraudsters catching the cleverest it's the difference between success and failure there's a whole class of problems like this ones with adaptive adversaries they rarely if ever present with the repeatable pattern that's discernable to computers instead there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption and increasingly these problems are buried in big data for example terrorism terrorists are always adapting in minor and major ways to new circumstances and despite what you might see on TV these adaptations and the detection of them are fundamentally human computers don't detect novel patterns or new behaviors or humans do humans using technology testing hypotheses searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence he was caught by dedicated resourceful brilliant people in partnerships with various technologies as appealing as it might sound you cannot algorithmically data-mine your way to the answer there is no find terrorists button and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems the less effective data mining can be instead people will have to look at data and search for insight and as Licklider foresaw long ago the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation and as Kasparov realized that means minimizing friction at the interface now this approach makes possible things like combing through all available data from very different sources identifying key relationships and putting of that in one place something that's been nearly impossible to do before the salm this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications to others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance that must be acknowledged and they can't be swept aside even with the best of intense so let's explore through a couple of examples the impact that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis have had in recent time in October 2007 US and coalition forces raided an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar on the Syrian border of Iraq they found a treasure trove of documents 700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters these foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf the Levant in North Africa to join al-qaeda in Iraq these records were human resource forms the foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization it turns out that al-qaeda too is not without its bureaucracy they answered questions like who recruited you what's your hometown what occupation do you seek and that last question a surprising insight was revealed the vast majority of foreign fighters were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom hugely important since between 2003 and 2007 Iraq had thirteen hundred and eighty two suicide bombings a major source of instability analyzing this data was hard the originals were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated the friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational timeframe using humans PDFs and tenacity alone the researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper to explore non-obvious hypotheses and in fact insights emerged 20% of the foreign fighters were from Libya 50% of those from a single town in Libya hugely important since prior statistics but that figure at 3% it also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in Al Quaida Abu Yahya al-libi a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group in March of 2007 he gave a speech after worship was a surge and participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters perhaps most clever of all though and least obvious by flipping the data on its head the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria that were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border these were networks of mercenaries not ideologues who were in the coordination business for profit for example they charged Saudi foreign fighters substantially more than Libyans money that would have otherwise gone to al Qaeda perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they were cheating would-be jihadists in January 2010 a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti third deadliest earthquake of all time left 1 million people 10% of the population homeless one seemingly small aspect of the overall relief ever became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water soccer rolling January and February the dry months in Haiti yet many of the camps had developed standing water the only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's floodplains had been leveled in the earthquake leadership inside so the question is which camps are at risk how many people in these camps what's the timeline for flooding and give it very limited resources infrastructure how do we prioritize the relocation the data was incredibly disparate US Army had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country there was data online from a 2006 environmental risk conference others geospatial data not have been integrated the human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need the computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospatial information social media data and relief organization information to answer this question by implementing a superior process what was otherwise a task for 40 people over three months became a simple job for three people in 40 hours all victories for human-computer symbiosis were more than 50 years into lick lighters vision for the future and the data suggest that we should be quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems man and machine in cooperation together thank you

**Transcript**:
I'd like to tell you about two games of chess the first happened in 1997 which Garry Kasparov a human lost a deep-blue a machine to many this was the dawn of a new era one where man would be dominated by machine but here we are 20 years on and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the iPad not how the second game was a freestyle chess tournament in 2005 and which man and machine could enter together as partners rather than adversaries if they so chose at first the results were predictable even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster with a relatively weak laptop the surprise came at the end who won not a grandmaster with the supercomputer but actually two American amateurs using three relatively weak laptops their ability to coach and manipulate their computers to deeply explore specific positions effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge of the grandmasters in the superior computational power of other adversaries this is an astonishing result average men average machines beating the best man the best machine and anyways isn't it supposed to be man versus machine instead it's about cooperation and the right type of cooperation we've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years it's a sexy vision for sure many of embraces become the dominant school of thought computer science but as we enter the era of big data of network systems of open platforms and embedded technology I'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time I'm talking about JCR Licklider z' human-computer symbiosis perhaps better termed intelligence augmentation I a wick lighter was a computer science Titan who had a profound effect

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Window, an opening constructed in a wall to emit light or air. When the Scandinavian settlers invaded England in the Middle Ages, they brought with them a whole slew of words whose modern descendants have become part of our everyday vernacular. Their word for window was related to the Old Norse word for the same architectural feature, vindauga. Vindauga was a compound, composed of two separate words: vindr, meaning wind and auga, meaning eye. The word vindauga was probably quite old, having come into being long before windows were made of glass. This type of metaphoric compound, called a kenning, was very popular in both Norse and Old English. The beautiful literary trope was used in the Norse word for ship, literally "wave stead." And, in the epic poem, "Beowulf," where the sea is described as a whale road and blood is described as battle sweat and slaughter dew. From its literal yet lyrical beginning, the word window has expanded beyond its concrete definition as a construction or design element to be used figuratively in phrases like the poetic "window of opportunity."

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: The Scandinavians brought a slew of words to England in the Middle Ages. One was the combination of two words which came to mean window. The word they brought was vindauga. What does the last part of the word (auga) mean?
Options: A. Eye, B. Hole, C. Opening, D. Light
Correct Option: A

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] look i had second thoughts really about whether i could talk about this to such a vital and a live audience as you guys but then i remember the quote from gloria steinem which goes the truth will set you free but first it will piss you off [Laughter] so so with that in mind i'm going to set about trying to do those things here and talk about dying in the 21st century now the first thing that will piss you off undoubtedly is that all of us are in fact going to die in the 21st century there will be no exceptions to that um there are apparently about one in eight of you who think you're immortal on surveys but unfortunately that doesn't this isn't going to happen um while i give this talk in the next 10 minutes 100 million of my cells will die and over the course of today 2000 of my brain cells will die and never come back so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece anyway the second thing i want to say about dying in the 21st century apart from what's going to happen to everybody is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on so there you go that's the truth no doubt that will piss you off and now let's see whether we can set you free i don't promise anything now as you heard in the intro i work in intensive care and i think i've kind of lived through the heyday of intensive care this has been a ride man this has been fantastic we have machines that go ping there's many of them up there and we have some wizard technology which i think has worked really well and over the course of the time i've worked in intensive care the death rate for males in australia has halved and intensive care has had something to do with that certainly a lot of the technologies that we use have got something to do with that so we have had tremendous success and we we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit and we started using expressions like life-saving i really apologize to everybody for doing that because obviously we don't what we do is prolong people's lives and delay death and redirect death but we we can't strictly speaking save lives on any sort of permanent basis and what's really happened over the period of time that i've been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the 70s 80s and 90s are now coming to die in the 21st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to in quite the way we did then so what's happening now is there's been a big shift in the way that people die and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable to what we can do as what it used to be like when i was doing this in the 80s and 90s so we kind of we kind of got a bit caught up with this and we haven't really squared with you guys about what's really happening now and it's about time we did i kind of woke up to this bit in the late 90s when i met this guy this guy is called jim jim smith and he looked like this i was called down to the ward to see him his is the little hand i was called down the wall to see him by a respiratory physician he he said look there's a guy down here he's got pneumonia and he looks like he needs intensive care his daughter's here and she wants everything possible to be done which is a familiar phrase to to us so i go down to the ward and see gym and his skin is translucent like this you can see his bones through the skin he's very very thin and he is indeed very very sick with pneumonia and he's too sick to talk to me so i talked to his daughter kathleen and i say to her did you and jim ever talk about what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation and she looked at me and said no of course not i thought okay take this steady um and i got talking to her and after a while she said to me you know we always thought there'd be time jim was 94. and i realized that something wasn't happening here there wasn't this dialogue going on that i imagined was happening so a group of us started doing survey work and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in newcastle in the newcastle area and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their heart stopped beating one in a hundred and only one in 500 of them had a plan about what to do if they became seriously ill i realized of course this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large and i work in acute care this is john hunter hospital and i thought surely we we do better than that so a colleague of mine from nursing called lisa shaw and i went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had any had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die and we didn't find a single record of any preference about goals treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient so we started to realize that we had a problem and the problem is more serious because of this what we know is that obviously we are all going to die but how we die is actually really important obviously not just to us but also to how that features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards how we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us and the stress created in families by dying is enormous and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else so dying in intensive care is not your top option if if you've got a choice and if that wasn't bad enough of course all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you in fact about one in 10 of you at this point will die in intensive care in the us it's one in five in miami it's three out of five people die in intensive care so this is the sort of momentum that we've got at the moment the reason why this is all happening is due to this and i do have to take you through what this is about these are the four ways to go so one of these will happen to all of us the ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical interest sudden death it's quite likely in an audience this size this won't happen to anybody here sudden death has become very rare the death of little nail and cordelia and all that sort of stuff just doesn't happen anymore the dying process of those with terminal illness that we've just seen occurs to younger people by the time you've reached 80 this is unlikely to happen to you only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer the big growth industry are these what you die of is increasing organ failure with your respiratory cardiac renal whatever organs packing up each of these would be an admission to an acute care hospital at the end of which or at some point during which somebody says enough is enough and we stop and this one's the biggest growth industry of all and at least six out of ten of the people in this room will die this form which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing frailty and frailty is an inevitable part of aging and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing that people die of now and the last few years or last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability unfortunately enjoying it so far sorry i just feel such a i feel such a cassandra here um what can i say that's positive what's positive is that this is happening at very great age now we are we are all most of us living to to reach this point you know historically we didn't do that this is what happens to you when you live to be a great age and unfortunately increasing longevity does mean more old age not more youth i'm sorry to say that um what we did anyway look what we did we didn't just take this lying down at john hunter hospital and elsewhere we've started a whole series of projects to try and look about whether we could in fact involve people much more in the way that in the way that things happen to them but we realize of course that we are dealing with cultural issues um and this is i love this climped painting because if the more you look at it the more you kind of get the whole issue that's going on here which is clearly the death the separation of death from the living and the fear like if you actually look there's one woman there who has her eyes open she's the one he's looking at and he's the one he's coming for can you see that she looks terrified it's an amazing picture anyway we had a major cultural issue clearly people didn't want us to talk about death oh we thought that so with loads of funding from the federal government and the local health service we introduced the thing that john hunter called respecting patient choices we trained hundreds of people to go to the wards and talk to people about the fact that they would die and what would they prefer under those circumstances they loved it the families and the patients they loved it nine uh 98 of people really thought this just should be normal practice and that this is how things should work and when they express wishes all of those wishes came true as it were we were able to make that happen for them but then when the funding ran out we went back to look six months later and everybody had stopped again and nobody was having these conversations anymore so that was really kind of heartbreaking for us because we thought this was going to really take off the cultural issue had reasserted itself so here's the pitch i think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway to icu without thinking hard about whether or not that's where we all want to end up particularly as we come older and increasingly frail and icu has less and less and less to offer us there has to be a little side road off there for people who don't want to go on that track and i have one small idea and uh one big idea about what could happen and this is a small idea the small idea is let's all of us engage with more with this in the way that jason has illustrated why can't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this there are a couple of things you can do one of them is um you can er just ask this simple question this this question never fails in the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself who would you like to speak for you that's a really important question to ask people because giving people the control over who that is produces an amazing outcome the second thing you can say is have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we can got a better idea of what it is we can do so that's a little idea the big idea i think is more political i think we have to get onto this i i suggested we should have occupied death my wife said i said rio right sitting's in the mortuary yeah yeah sure so that one didn't really run but i did i was very struck by this now i'm in aging hippie is i don't know i don't think i look like that anymore but um i had two two of my kids were born at home in the in the 80s when home birth was a big thing and now we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation so if you just replace all these all these words of birth i like peace love natural death as a as an option i do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which it's going now listen that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia i want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all i hate euthanasia i think it's a sideshow i don't think euthanasia matters i actually think that that in country in places like oregon where you can have physician-assisted suicide you take a poisonous dose of stuff only half a percent of people ever do that i'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent of people who don't want to do that i think most people don't want to be dead but i do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds so i'm an opponent of euthanasia but i do think we have to give people back some control it deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply i think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all this is a quote from from dame sicily saunders whom i met when i was a medical student she she founded the hospice movement and she says you matter because you are and you matter to the last moment of your life and i firmly believe that that's the message that we have to carry forward thank you [Music]

[Music] [Applause] look i had second thoughts really about whether i could talk about this to such a vital and a live audience as you guys but then i remember the quote from gloria steinem which goes the truth will set you free but first it will piss you off [Laughter] so so with that in mind i'm going to set about trying to do those things here and talk about dying in the 21st century now the first thing that will piss you off undoubtedly is that all of us are in fact going to die in the 21st century there will be no exceptions to that um there are apparently about one in eight of you who think you're immortal on surveys but unfortunately that doesn't this isn't going to happen um while i give this talk in the next 10 minutes 100 million of my cells will die and over the course of today 2000 of my brain cells will die and never come back so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece anyway the second thing i want to say about dying in the 21st century apart from what's going to happen to everybody is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on so there you go that's the truth no doubt that will piss you off and now let's see whether we can set you free i don't promise anything now as you heard in the intro i work in intensive care and i think i've kind of lived through the heyday of intensive care this has been a ride man this has been fantastic we have machines that go ping there's many of them up there and we have some wizard technology which i think has worked really well and over the course of the time i've worked in intensive care the death rate for males in australia has halved and

pneumonia and he's too sick to talk to me so i talked to his daughter kathleen and i say to her did you and jim ever talk about what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation and she looked at me and said no of course not i thought okay take this steady um and i got talking to her and after a while she said to me you know we always thought there'd be time jim was 94. and i realized that something wasn't happening here there wasn't this dialogue going on that i imagined was happening so a group of us started doing survey work and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in newcastle in the newcastle area and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their heart stopped beating one in a hundred and only one in 500 of them had a plan about what to do if they became seriously ill i realized of course this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large and i work in acute care this is john hunter hospital and i thought surely we we do better than that so a colleague of mine from nursing called lisa shaw and i went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had any had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die and we didn't find a single record of any preference about goals treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient so we started to realize that we had a problem and the problem is more serious because of this what we know is that obviously we are all going to die but how we die is actually really important obviously not just to us but also to how that features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards how we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us and the stress created in families by dying is enormous and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else so dying in intensive care is not your top option if if you've got a choice and if that wasn't bad enough of course all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you in fact about one in 10 of you at this point will die in intensive care in the us it's one in five in miami it's three out of five people die in intensive care so this is the sort of momentum that we've got at the moment the reason why this is all happening is due to this and i do have to take you through what this is about these are the four ways to go so one of these will happen to all of us the ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical interest sudden death it's quite likely in an audience this size this won't happen to anybody here sudden death has become very rare the death of little nail and cordelia and all that sort of stuff just doesn't happen anymore the dying process of those with terminal illness that we've just seen occurs to younger people by the time you've reached 80 this is unlikely to happen to you only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer the big growth industry are these what you die of is increasing organ failure with your respiratory cardiac renal whatever organs packing up each of these would be an admission to an acute care hospital at the end of which or at some point during which somebody says enough is enough and we stop and this one's the biggest growth industry of all and at least six out of ten of the people in this room will die this form which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing frailty and frailty is an inevitable part of aging and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing that people die of now and the last few years or last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability unfortunately enjoying it so far sorry i just feel such a i feel such a cassandra here um what can i say that's positive what's positive is that this is happening at very great age now we are we are all most of us living to to reach this point you know historically we didn't do that this is what happens to you when you live to be a great age and unfortunately increasing longevity does mean more old age not more youth i'm sorry to say that um what we did anyway look what we did we didn't just take this lying down at john hunter hospital and elsewhere we've started a whole series of projects to try and look about whether we could in fact involve people much more in the way that in the way that things happen to them but we realize of course that we are dealing with cultural issues um and this is i love this climped painting because if the more you look at it the more you kind of get the whole issue that's going on here which is clearly the death the separation of death from the living and the fear like if you actually look there's one woman there who has her eyes open she's the one he's looking at and he's the one he's coming for can you see that she looks terrified it's an amazing picture anyway we had a major cultural issue clearly people didn't want us to talk about death oh we thought that so with loads of funding from the federal government and the local health service we introduced the thing that john hunter called respecting patient choices we trained hundreds of people to go to the wards and talk to people about the fact that they would die and what would they prefer under those circumstances they loved it the families and the patients they loved it nine uh 98 of people really thought this just should be normal practice and that this is how things should work and when they express wishes all of those wishes came true as it were we were able to make that happen for them but then when the funding ran out we went back to look six months later and everybody had stopped again and nobody was having these conversations anymore so that was really kind of heartbreaking for us because we thought this was going to really take off the cultural issue had reasserted itself so here's the pitch i think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway to icu without thinking hard about whether or not that's where we all want to end up particularly as we come older and increasingly frail and icu has less and less and less to offer us there has to be a little side road off there for people who don't want to go on that track and i have one small idea and uh one big idea about what could happen and this is a small idea the small idea is let's all of us engage with more with this in the way that jason has illustrated why can't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this there are a couple of things you can do one of them is um you can er just ask this simple question this this question never fails in the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself who would you like to speak for you that's a really important question to ask people because giving people the control over who that is produces an amazing outcome the second thing you can say is have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we can got a better idea of what it is we can do so that's a little idea the big idea i think is more political i think we have to get onto this i i suggested we should have occupied death my wife said i said rio right sitting's in the mortuary yeah yeah sure so that one didn't really run but i did i was very struck by this now i'm in aging hippie is i don't know i don't think i look like that anymore but um i had two two of my kids were born at home in the in the 80s when home birth was a big thing and now we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation so if you just replace all these all these words of birth i like peace love natural death as a as an option i do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which it's going now listen that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia i want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all i hate euthanasia i think it's a sideshow i don't think euthanasia matters i actually think that that in country in places like oregon where you can have physician-assisted suicide you take a poisonous dose of stuff only half a percent of people ever do that i'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent of people who don't want to do that i think most people don't want to be dead but i do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds so i'm an opponent of euthanasia but i do think we have to give people back some control it deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply i think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all this is a quote from from dame sicily saunders whom i met when i was a medical student she she founded the hospice movement and she says you matter because you are and you matter to the last moment of your life and i firmly believe that that's the message that we have to carry forward thank you [Music]

- Relevance Score: 0.8000 (The generated question is related to the topic of death and its causes, but it specifically asks about people over 80, which is not the focus of the ground truth question.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.0000 (The correct answer in the generated question is not explicitly stated, but based on the transcript, it should be C. Dwindling capacity with increasing frailty, which matches the ground truth answer A. Frailty. However, since the correct option is not clearly marked in the generated question, this score is 0.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.6000 (The distractors in the generated question are plausible but could be more challenging. Option A, Cancer, is mentioned in the transcript as a less common cause of death in people over 80, making it a somewhat plausible distractor.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 0.9000 (The generated question is clear and easy to understand, but the lack of a clearly marked correct answer reduces the score.)

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] look i had second thoughts really about whether i could talk about this to such a vital and a live audience as you guys but then i remember the quote from gloria steinem which goes the truth will set you free but first it will piss you off [Laughter] so so with that in mind i'm going to set about trying to do those things here and talk about dying in the 21st century now the first thing that will piss you off undoubtedly is that all of us are in fact going to die in the 21st century there will be no exceptions to that um there are apparently about one in eight of you who think you're immortal on surveys but unfortunately that doesn't this isn't going to happen um while i give this talk in the next 10 minutes 100 million of my cells will die and over the course of today 2000 of my brain cells will die and never come back so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece anyway the second thing i want to say about dying in the 21st century apart from what's going to happen to everybody is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on so there you go that's the truth no doubt that will piss you off and now let's see whether we can set you free i don't promise anything now as you heard in the intro i work in intensive care and i think i've kind of lived through the heyday of intensive care this has been a ride man this has been fantastic we have machines that go ping there's many of them up there and we have some wizard technology which i think has worked really well and over the course of the time i've worked in intensive care the death rate for males in australia has halved and intensive care has had something to do with that certainly a lot of the technologies that we use have got something to do with that so we have had tremendous success and we we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit and we started using expressions like life-saving i really apologize to everybody for doing that because obviously we don't what we do is prolong people's lives and delay death and redirect death but we we can't strictly speaking save lives on any sort of permanent basis and what's really happened over the period of time that i've been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the 70s 80s and 90s are now coming to die in the 21st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to in quite the way we did then so what's happening now is there's been a big shift in the way that people die and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable to what we can do as what it used to be like when i was doing this in the 80s and 90s so we kind of we kind of got a bit caught up with this and we haven't really squared with you guys about what's really happening now and it's about time we did i kind of woke up to this bit in the late 90s when i met this guy this guy is called jim jim smith and he looked like this i was called down to the ward to see him his is the little hand i was called down the wall to see him by a respiratory physician he he said look there's a guy down here he's got pneumonia and he looks like he needs intensive care his daughter's here and she wants everything possible to be done which

and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else so dying in intensive care is not your top option if if you've got a choice and if that wasn't bad enough of course all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you in fact about one in 10 of you at this point will die in intensive care in the us it's one in five in miami it's three out of five people die in intensive care so this is the sort of momentum that we've got at the moment the reason why this is all happening is due to this and i do have to take you through what this is about these are the four ways to go so one of these will happen to all of us the ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical interest sudden death it's quite likely in an audience this size this won't happen to anybody here sudden death has become very rare the death of little nail and cordelia and all that sort of stuff just doesn't happen anymore the dying process of those with terminal illness that we've just seen occurs to younger people by the time you've reached 80 this is unlikely to happen to you only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer the big growth industry are these what you die of is increasing organ failure with your respiratory cardiac renal whatever organs packing up each of these would be an admission to an acute care hospital at the end of which or at some point during which somebody says enough is enough and we stop and this one's the biggest growth industry of all and at least six out of ten of the people in this room will die this form which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing frailty and frailty is an inevitable part of aging and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing that people die of now and the last few years or last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability unfortunately enjoying it so far sorry i just feel such a i feel such a cassandra here um what can i say that's positive what's positive is that this is happening at very great age now we are we are all most of us living to to reach this point you know historically we didn't do that this is what happens to you when you live to be a great age and unfortunately increasing longevity does mean more old age not more youth i'm sorry to say that um what we did anyway look what we did we didn't just take this lying down at john hunter hospital and elsewhere we've started a whole series of projects to try and look about whether we could in fact involve people much more in the way that in the way that things happen to them but we realize of course that we are dealing with cultural issues um and this is i love this climped painting because if the more you look at it the more you kind of get the whole issue that's going on here which is clearly the death the separation of death from the living and the fear like if you actually look there's one woman there who has her eyes open she's the one he's looking at and he's the one he's coming for can you see that she looks terrified it's an amazing picture anyway we had a major cultural issue clearly people didn't want us to talk about death oh we thought that so with loads of funding from the federal government and the local health service we introduced the thing that john hunter called respecting patient choices we trained hundreds of people to go to the wards and talk to people about the fact that they would die and what would they prefer under those circumstances they loved it the families and the patients they loved it nine uh 98 of people really thought this just should be normal practice and that this is how things should work and when they express wishes all of those wishes came true as it were we were able to make that happen for them but then when the funding ran out we went back to look six months later and everybody had stopped again and nobody was having these conversations anymore so that was really kind of heartbreaking for us because we thought this was going to really take off the cultural issue had reasserted itself so here's the pitch i think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway to icu without thinking hard about whether or not that's where we all want to end up particularly as we come older and increasingly frail and icu has less and less and less to offer us there has to be a little side road off there for people who don't want to go on that track and i have one small idea and uh one big idea about what could happen and this is a small idea the small idea is let's all of us engage with more with this in the way that jason has illustrated why can't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this there are a couple of things you can do one of them is um you can er just ask this simple question this this question never fails in the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself who would you like to speak for you that's a really important question to ask people because giving people the control over who that is produces an amazing outcome the second thing you can say is have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we can got a better idea of what it is we can do so that's a little idea the big idea i think is more political i think we have to get onto this i i suggested we should have occupied death my wife said i said rio right sitting's in the mortuary yeah yeah sure so that one didn't really run but i did i was very struck by this now i'm in aging hippie is i don't know i don't think i look like that anymore but um i had two two of my kids were born at home in the in the 80s when home birth was a big thing and now we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation so if you just replace all these all these words of birth i like peace love natural death as a as an option i do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which it's going now listen that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia i want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all i hate euthanasia i think it's a sideshow i don't think euthanasia matters i actually think that that in country in places like oregon where you can have physician-assisted suicide you take a poisonous dose of stuff only half a percent of people ever do that i'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent of people who don't want to do that i think most people don't want to be dead but i do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds so i'm an opponent of euthanasia but i do think we have to give people back some control it deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply i think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all this is a quote from from dame sicily saunders whom i met when i was a medical student she she founded the hospice movement and she says you matter because you are and you matter to the last moment of your life and i firmly believe that that's the message that we have to carry forward thank you [Music]

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Dynamite, an explosive consisting of nitroglycerin, typically molded into sticks. Dynamite, which coincidentally is closely related to the word dynasty, has as much to do with familial persuasion as it does etymology. Following in the footsteps of his inventor father, Alfred Nobel took up engineering. In 1850, he was exposed to the work of Ascanio Sobrero, the chemist who invented nitroglycerin. More powerful than gun powder and extremely unpredictable, this highly explosive liquid captivated Alfred. Working closely with his father, he began experimenting with nitroglycerin, searching for a practical application for the compound. After several explosions, including one that killed Alfred's brother, authorities banned nitroglycerin tests within Stockholm city limits. Undeterred, Alfred moved his lab and began experimenting with additives, eventually finding one that transformed the dangerous liquid into malleable paste, easier to handle and perfect for construction sites. He named this material dynamite, from the Greek dunamis, meaning power, and the common scientific suffix -ite. Explosives made Alfred a very wealthy man. And, in an effort to balance the destruction caused by his invention, he created an endowment that would award Nobel Prizes to authors, scientists, and advocates of world peace for generations to come.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby In the 11th and 12th centuries, most English commoners were illiterate. Since they had no way to learn the Bible, the clergy came up with an inventive solution: they'd create plays out of certain Bible stories so even people who couldn't read could learn them. These were called mystery plays because they revealed the mystery of God's word. At about the same time, the clergy also developed plays about the saints of the church, called miracle plays. In the beginning, the clergy members acted out Bible stories on the steps outside the cathedral. The audience reacted so well that soon they needed to move out to the street around the town square. By building moving carts to put on each play and by lining up one after the other, they could put on cycles of stories, which would take the viewer from Genesis to Revelation. These movable carts, called pageants, looked like huge boxes on wheels. Each was two stories tall. The bottom story was curtained off and was used for costumes, props, and dressing. The top platform was the stage for the performance. Spectators assembled in various corners of the town, and the pageant would move around in the cycle until the villagers had seen the entire series. Soon, the plays required more actors than the clergy could supply. So, by the 13th century, different guilds were asked to be responsible for acting out different parts of the cycle. The assignments were meant to reflect the guilds' professions. For example, the carpenter's guild might put on the story of Noah's Ark, and the baker's guild might put on The Last Supper. Can you imagine what might happen to the story if the butcher's guild put on The Crucifixion of Christ? Yes, without the clergy, the plays soon started changing from their true Bible stories. By the end of the 14th century, a new form of drama, called the morality play, had evolved. Faith, truth, charity, and good deeds all became characters on the stage. And, at the same time, the opposite virtues of falsehood, covetousness, worldly flesh, and the devil became the antagonists. The morality plays were allegorical stories in which these characters battled for the control of the soul. Audiences loved the immoral characters, and spectators were encouraged to interact with the actors. Throwing rotten food and even getting into scuffles with other spectators became very common. The character of the devil often would roam through the crowds and pull unsuspecting watchers into a hell that was depicted as a dragon's mouth. The virtuous Biblical stories had morphed into crude and sometimes comic stories. The clergy intended to teach against immorality. How ironic, then, that the morality plays actually encouraged vices as more popular than virtues. By the mid-15th century, the church started to outlaw these performances. Town charters required that any theater must be built outside the city wall. One of the first theaters was built like a larger version of a pageant, with tiers of gallery seating encircling a grassy area in front of the stage. Sound familiar? A young William Shakespeare developed his craft here at the theater that was eventually renamed The Globe. The medieval morality play had led to Renaissance playwrights who were inspired by the inner struggles and the conscience of man. And that, in essence, is how drama emerged as a literary art form.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby In the 11th and 12th centuries, most English commoners were illiterate. Since they had no way to learn the Bible, the clergy came up with an inventive solution: they'd create plays out of certain Bible stories so even people who couldn't read could learn them. These were called mystery plays because they revealed the mystery of God's word. At about the same time, the clergy also developed plays about the saints of the church, called miracle plays. In the beginning, the clergy members acted out Bible stories on the steps outside the cathedral. The audience reacted so well that soon they needed to move out to the street around the town square. By building moving carts to put on each play and by lining up one after the other, they could put on cycles of stories, which would take the viewer from Genesis to Revelation. These movable carts, called pageants, looked like huge boxes on wheels. Each was two stories tall. The bottom story was curtained off and was used for costumes, props, and dressing. The top platform was the stage for the performance. Spectators assembled in various corners of the town, and the pageant would move around in the cycle until the villagers had seen the entire series. Soon, the plays required more actors than the clergy could supply. So, by the 13th century, different guilds were asked to be responsible for acting out different parts of the cycle. The assignments were meant to reflect the guilds' professions. For example, the carpenter's guild might put on the story of Noah's Ark, and the baker's guild might put on The Last Supper. Can you imagine what might happen to the story if the butcher's guild put on The Crucifixion of Christ? Yes, without the clergy, the plays soon started changing from their true Bible stories. By the end of the 14th century, a new form of drama, called the morality play, had evolved. Faith, truth, charity, and good deeds all became characters on the stage. And, at the same time, the opposite virtues of falsehood, covetousness, worldly flesh, and the devil became the antagonists. The morality plays were allegorical stories in which these characters battled for the control of the soul. Audiences loved the immoral characters, and spectators were encouraged to interact with the actors. Throwing rotten food and even getting into scuffles with other spectators became very common. The character of the devil often would roam through the crowds and pull unsuspecting watchers into a hell that was depicted as a dragon's mouth. The virtuous Biblical stories had morphed into crude and sometimes comic stories. The clergy intended to teach against immorality. How ironic, then, that the morality plays actually encouraged vices as more popular than virtues. By the mid-15th century, the church started to outlaw these performances. Town charters required that any theater must be built outside the city wall. One of the first theaters was built like a larger version of a pageant, with tiers of gallery seating encircling a grassy area in front of the stage. Sound familiar? A young William Shakespeare developed his craft here at the theater that was eventually renamed The Globe. The medieval morality play had led to Renaissance playwrights who were inspired by the inner struggles and the conscience of man. And that, in essence, is how drama emerged as a literary art form.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby These are grizzly bears. As you can see, they have big teeth and giant claws. But once you get to know them better, they're not as ferocious as you might think. They play a critical role in the function of our ecosystems, but, unfortunately, their habitat is dwindling fast. In order to protect them, it's important to know why do grizzlies choose certain areas to inhabit in the first place? Let's look at a threatened population of bears living in the rocky mountains of Canada. Remember those giant claws? Well, they're not for what you might think. They have evolved specifically for digging up energy-rich roots. It turns out that grizzlies eat a lot of plants. The ones that live here are almost vegetarians. You see, unlike other predators, grizzlies have diverse diets that can include up to 90% vegetation. However, maintaining a diet of plants can be difficult. In these northern latitudes, you have distinct seasons where it's really nice and green for part of the year and really cold for the other part. If you eat plants, you have almost nothing to eat for the cold part of the year. So, you either have to migrate like geese or hibernate like ground squirrels. Grizzly bears hibernate. Their behaviors are closely synchronized with the seasons. During the summer, they have to pack on enough body fat to survive the winter. Without it, they would either starve or not have enough energy to successfully produce offspring. But when you eat mostly plants, it's hard to gain a lot of weight. You need to be a highly effective forager. So, bears tightly follow the schedule of the plants and harvest them like crops at the point in time when they are at the most nutritious. This will happen in different places at different times. In autumn, a large male grizzly can eat up to 200,000 berries in a single day. Therefore, to protect these bears, researchers want to take a closer look at the seasonal interaction between grizzlies and plants to identify areas of the highest quality habitat. This begins 700 kilometers up in space. Up here, two NASA satellites carry sensors that are sensitive to the light reflected by vegetation. Every species of plant reflects a unique combination of wave lengths, called spectral signatures that act like different chords on a piano but use light instead of sound. These signatures are recorded by the satellites every day and are combined like frames in a movie so you can watch the vegetation grow over an entire summer. Simultaneously, the movements of bears wearing GPS collars are monitored to see how they respond to the ebb and flow of nutrition throughout their habitat. Now, instead of ordinary, static habitat maps, these dynamic, time-lapse habitat maps could be used for grizzly bear conservation in a number of ways. First, they help calculate the carrying capacity of the study area. In other words, how many bears can the remaining habitat support? Is there enough food to go around? Second, the maps show where bears will be foraging at specific times. We can prevent disturbing the bears and stressing them out by avoiding these areas during important feeding periods. Finally, the maps can be used to predict the effects of climate change, where shifting annual temperatures will alter the rate of plant growth, throwing the bears' precise foraging schedule out of whack. This provides less food and increases competition between bears. Grizzlies are charismatic symbols of the wilderness. These habitat maps made from satellite imagery can not only help conserve grizzly bears but all sorts of different species. They aid us in understanding how ecosystems function, where they are threatened, and how we can try to keep our fragile, amazing planet intact.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby These are grizzly bears. As you can see, they have big teeth and giant claws. But once you get to know them better, they're not as ferocious as you might think. They play a critical role in the function of our ecosystems, but, unfortunately, their habitat is dwindling fast. In order to protect them, it's important to know why do grizzlies choose certain areas to inhabit in the first place? Let's look at a threatened population of bears living in the rocky mountains of Canada. Remember those giant claws? Well, they're not for what you might think. They have evolved specifically for digging up energy-rich roots. It turns out that grizzlies eat a lot of plants. The ones that live here are almost vegetarians. You see, unlike other predators, grizzlies have diverse diets that can include up to 90% vegetation. However, maintaining a diet of plants can be difficult. In these northern latitudes, you have distinct seasons where it's really nice and green for part of the year and really cold for the other part. If you eat plants, you have almost nothing to eat for the cold part of the year. So, you either have to migrate like geese or hibernate like ground squirrels. Grizzly bears hibernate. Their behaviors are closely synchronized with the seasons. During the summer, they have to pack on enough body fat to survive the winter. Without it, they would either starve or not have enough energy to successfully produce offspring. But when you eat mostly plants, it's hard to gain a lot of weight. You need to be a highly effective forager. So, bears tightly follow the schedule of the plants and harvest them like crops at the point in time when they are at the most nutritious. This will happen in different places at different times. In autumn, a large male grizzly can eat up to 200,000 berries in a single day. Therefore, to protect these bears, researchers want to take a closer look at the seasonal interaction between grizzlies and plants to identify areas of the highest quality habitat. This begins 700 kilometers up in space. Up here, two NASA satellites carry sensors that are sensitive to the light reflected by vegetation. Every species of plant reflects a unique combination of wave lengths, called spectral signatures that act like different chords on a piano but use light instead of sound. These signatures are recorded by the satellites every day and are combined like frames in a movie so you can watch the vegetation grow over an entire summer. Simultaneously, the movements of bears wearing GPS collars are monitored to see how they respond to the ebb and flow of nutrition throughout their habitat. Now, instead of ordinary, static habitat maps, these dynamic, time-lapse habitat maps could be used for grizzly bear conservation in a number of ways. First, they help calculate the carrying capacity of the study area. In other words, how many bears can the remaining habitat support? Is there enough food to go around? Second, the maps show where bears will be foraging at specific times. We can prevent disturbing the bears and stressing them out by avoiding these areas during important feeding periods. Finally, the maps can be used to predict the effects of climate change, where shifting annual temperatures will alter the rate of plant growth, throwing the bears' precise foraging schedule out of whack. This provides less food and increases competition between bears. Grizzlies are charismatic symbols of the wilderness. These habitat maps made from satellite imagery can not only help conserve grizzly bears but all sorts of different species. They aid us in understanding how ecosystems function, where they are threatened, and how we can try to keep our fragile, amazing planet intact.

**Transcript**:
gotcha mosquitoes I hate them don't you that awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives me absolutely crazy knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood that's awful right in fact there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes when they fly into our bedroom at night they prefer to bite my wife but that's fascinating right why does she receive more bites than I do and the answer is smell the smell of our body and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitoes some of us are just more attractive than others so my wife smells nicer than I do or I just stink more than she does either way either way mosquitoes find us in the dark by sniffing us out they smell us and during my PhD I wanted to know exactly what chemicals from our skin mosquitoes used African malaria mosquitoes use to track us down at night there's a whole range of compounds that they do use and this was not going to be an easy task and therefore we set up various experiments why did we set up these experiments because half the world's population runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria through a simple mosquito bite every 30 seconds somewhere on this planet a child dies of malaria and Paula levy this morning he was talking about the metaphor of the 77 crashing in the United States well in Africa we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 747 crashing every day perhaps if we can attract these mosquitoes to traps bait it with our smell we may be able to stop transmission of disease now solving this puzzle was not an easy thing because we produced hundreds of difference of chemicals on the skin but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed first we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body strange so we set up an experiment whereby we put a naked volunteer in a large cage and in that case we release mosquitoes to see where they were biting on the body of that person and we found some remarkable differences on the left here you see the bites by the Dutch malaria mosquito on this person there's a very strong preference for biting on the face in contrast the African malaria mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person and that of course we should have known all along because they're called mosquitoes you see that's right and so and so we started focusing on the smell of feet on the smell of human feet until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse think of it and this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment we tried with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese which smells badly after feet to attract African malaria mosquitoes and you know what it worked in fact it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that were using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be 2 to 3 times more attractive to mosquitoes than humans Limburg be proud of your cheese as it is now used in the fight against malaria that's the cheese just to show you my second story it's remarkable as well it's about man's best friend it's about dogs and I will show you how we can use dogs and the fight against malaria one of the best ways of killing mosquitoes is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmitted disease it's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae why because they're just like the CIA in that pool of water these larvae are concentrated they're all together there they are in mobile they can't escape from the water they can't fly and and they're accessible you can actually walk up to that tool and you can kill them there right so the problem that we face with this is that throughout the landscape all these pools are falta with a larvae they're scattered all over the place which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides the last year we thought very very hard how can we resolve this problem until we realized that just like us we have unique smell that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell and so we set up another crazy experiment because we collected the smell of these larvae put it on pieces of cloth and then did something very remarkable here we have a bar with four holes and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole whoo that was very quick and then you see the dog it's called tweet it's a border collie he's examining these holes and now he's got it all ready he's going back to check the control holes again but he's coming back to the first one and now he's locking into that smell which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitoes in the field and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria this lady is Alan from Goss wave she's one of the best dog trainers in the world and she believes that we can do a lot more since we also know that people that carry malaria parasite smell different compared to people that are uninfected she's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite that means that in the population where malaria has gone down all the way and there's food few people remaining with parasites that the dogs can find these people we can treat them with anti malarial drugs and give a final blow to malaria man's best friend in the fight against malaria my third story is perhaps even more remarkable and I should say has never been shown to the public until today yeah it's a crazy story but I believe it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge against mosquitoes ever in fact people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes and the question of course is what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes and the answer I have right here in my pocket if I get it it's a tongueless simple tablet and when I take it with water it does miracles thank you now let me show you how this works here in this box I have a cage there's several hundred hungry female mosquitoes that I'm just about to release just kidding just kidding what I'm going to show you is I'm gonna stick my arm into it and I will show you how quickly they will bite there we go don't worry I do this all the time in the lab there we go okay now on the video on the video here I'm gonna show you exactly the same thing except that what I'm showing you in the video happened one hour after I took the tablet have a look that doesn't work okay sorry about that I'm sticky getting my arm I'm giving them a big juicy blunt meal I'm shaking them off and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very very sick indeed here shown in fast motion and three hours later what we see on the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitoes very dead mosquitoes and I'm going to say ladies and gentlemen we have swapped the cards with mosquitoes they don't kill us we kill them now Maslak vp prayers now think of what we can do with this we can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases of epidemics right and better still imagine what would happen if in a very large area everyone would take this drugs this drug for just three weeks that would gives an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease so cheese dorks and a pill to kill mosquitoes that's the kind of out-of-the-box science that I love doing for the betterment of mankind but especially for her so that she can grow up in the world without malaria thank you

show you exactly the same thing except that what I'm showing you in the video happened one hour after I took the tablet have a look that doesn't work okay sorry about that I'm sticky getting my arm I'm giving them a big juicy blunt meal I'm shaking them off and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very very sick indeed here shown in fast motion and three hours later what we see on the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitoes very dead mosquitoes and I'm going to say ladies and gentlemen we have swapped the cards with mosquitoes they don't kill us we kill them now Maslak vp prayers now think of what we can do with this we can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases of epidemics right and better still imagine what would happen if in a very large area everyone would take this drugs this drug for just three weeks that would gives an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease so cheese dorks and a pill to kill mosquitoes that's the kind of out-of-the-box science that I love doing for the betterment of mankind but especially for her so that she can grow up in the world without malaria thank you

**Transcript**:
gotcha mosquitoes I hate them don't you that awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives me absolutely crazy knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood that's awful right in fact there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes when they fly into our bedroom at night they prefer to bite my wife but that's fascinating right why does she receive more bites than I do and the answer is smell the smell of our body and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitoes some of us are just more attractive than others so my wife smells nicer than I do or I just stink more than she does either way either way mosquitoes find us in the dark by sniffing us out they smell us and during my PhD I wanted to know exactly what chemicals from our skin mosquitoes used African malaria mosquitoes use to track us down at night there's a whole range of compounds that they do use and this was not going to be an easy task and therefore we set up various experiments why did we set up these experiments because half the world's population runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria through a simple mosquito bite every 30 seconds somewhere on this planet a child dies of malaria and Paula levy this morning he was talking about the metaphor of the 77 crashing in the United States well in Africa we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 747 crashing every day perhaps if we can attract these mosquitoes to traps bait it with our smell we may be able to stop transmission of disease now solving this puzzle was not an easy thing because we produced hundreds of difference of chemicals on the skin but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed first we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body strange so we set up an experiment whereby we put a naked volunteer in a large cage and in that case we release mosquitoes to see where they were biting on the body of that person and we found some remarkable differences on the left here you see the bites by the Dutch malaria mosquito on this person there's a very strong preference for biting on the face in contrast the African malaria mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person and that of course we should have known all along because they're called mosquitoes you see that's right and so and so we started focusing on the smell of feet on the smell of human feet until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse think of it and this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment we tried with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese which smells badly after feet to attract African malaria mosquitoes and you know what it worked in fact it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that were using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be 2 to 3 times more attractive to mosquitoes than humans Limburg be proud of your cheese as it is now used in the fight against malaria that's the cheese just to show you my second story it's remarkable as well it's about man's best friend it's about dogs and I will show you how we can use dogs and the fight against malaria one of the best ways of killing mosquitoes is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmitted disease it's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae why because they're just like the CIA in that pool of water these larvae are concentrated they're all together there they are in mobile they can't escape from the water they can't fly and and they're accessible you can actually walk up to that tool and you can kill them there right so the problem that we face with this is that throughout the landscape all these pools are falta with a larvae they're scattered all over the place which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides the last year we thought very very hard how can we resolve this problem until we realized that just like us we have unique smell that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell and so we set up another crazy experiment because we collected the smell of these larvae put it on pieces of cloth and then did something very remarkable here we have a bar with four holes and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole whoo that was very quick and then you see the dog it's called tweet it's a border collie he's examining these holes and now he's got it all ready he's going back to check the control holes again but he's coming back to the first one and now he's locking into that smell which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitoes in the field and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria this lady is Alan from Goss wave she's one of the best dog trainers in the world and she believes that we can do a lot more since we also know that people that carry malaria parasite smell different compared to people that are uninfected she's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite that means that in the population where malaria has gone down all the way and there's food few people remaining with parasites that the dogs can find these people we can treat them with anti malarial drugs and give a final blow to malaria man's best friend in the fight against malaria my third story is perhaps even more remarkable and I should say has never been shown to the public until today yeah it's a crazy story but I believe it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge against mosquitoes ever in fact people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes and the question of course is what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes and the answer I have right here in my pocket if I get it it's a tongueless simple tablet and when I take it with water it does miracles thank you now let me show you how this works here in this box I have a cage there's several hundred hungry female mosquitoes that I'm just about to release just kidding just kidding what I'm going to show you is I'm gonna stick my arm into it and I will show you how quickly they will bite there we go don't worry I do this all the time in the lab there we go okay now on the video on the video here I'm gonna

**Transcript**:
I always wanted to become a walking on the bar to a social engagement to to resonate other people's feelings thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them as a scientist I always wanted to measure that residence that sense of the other that happened so quickly in a blink of an eye when to its have the people's feelings we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen we're always in the stands of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity we do that all the time we just can't shake it off it's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves to understand the world around them is shaped by that test we are we are social to the core so my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long state hospitals this is a long time ago and for them autism was devastating they had profound intellectual disabilities they didn't talk but most of all they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them from their environment and from the people in fact at the time if you walked into a school for individuals of autism you hear a lot of noise plenty of commotion actions people doing things but they're always doing things by themselves so they may be looking at the light in the ceiling or they may be isolated in the corner or they might be engaged in this repetitive movements in self-stimulatory movements that let them know we're extremely extremely isolated well now we know that autism is this disruption the disruption of this resonance that I'm telling you these are survival skills these are survival skills that we inherited over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of other fragility without the caregiver they wouldn't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with this mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver from the first days and weeks of life babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as they looking at people they look at people's eyes because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away well they oriented the caregiver they can't give a 6 to baby and is out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind the social mind the social brain the panel we always think about autism as as something that happens later on in life it doesn't it begins at the beginning of life as babies engage with caregivers they soon realize that um well there is something in between the ears that is very important is invisible you can't see that is really critical and that thing is called attention and they learn soon enough even before they can utter one word that it can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want they also learn to follow other people's gaze because whatever people are looking at is what they're thinking about and soon enough they start to learn about the meaning of things because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something then I'm just getting a directional cue they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing the attitude and soon enough they start building this body of meanings but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction those are meanings that are acquired as part of their share experiences with others well this is a little 50 month old little girl and she has autism and I am coming so close to her that I'm maybe 2 inches from her face and she's quite oblivious to me imagine if I did that to you and I came 2 inches from your face you do probably two things wouldn't you you would recoil you call the police you do something because it's virtually impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get that reaction we do so remember intuitively effortlessly this is our body wisdom is not something that is mediated by a language our body just knows that and we've known that for a long time and this is not something that happens to humans only it happens to some of our palliative cousins because if you're a monkey and you look at another monkey and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal threat well you are not going to be alive for long so something that in other species our survival mechanisms without them they wouldn't they wouldn't basically live we bring into the context of human beings and this is what we need to simply act act socially now she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her and you think hell maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you well a few minutes later she goes to the corner of the room and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an M&M so I could not attract her attention but something a thing did now most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people now for this girl that division line is not so clear and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences now what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating himself further and further so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic the brain determines we were going to be but in fact the brain also becomes we are and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction this is what's happening with their mind and this is what's happening with a brain well autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders and it's a brain disorder is a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born we now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted now those individuals who don't talk at all there are those individuals who talk too much there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school you see them running the periphery fence of the school day if you let them to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage repeatedly relentlessly but often in an awkward fashion without that immediate resonance well this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time when I started in this field we thought that they were for individuals of autism for 10,000 a very rare condition well now we now it's more like 1 in 100 there are millions of individuals of autism all around the societal cost of this condition is huge in the US alone maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars and you know what most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled individuals who need wraparound services services that are very very intensive and those services can cost in excess of 60 to $80,000 a year those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment because now we know that what doesn't create itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you were we to be able to identify this condition that at earlier point and intervene and treat I can tell you and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past ten years this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition also we have a window of opportunity because the brain is malleable for just so long and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life it's not that that window closes it doesn't but it diminishes considerably and yet the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years and in disadvantaged populations the populations that don't have access to clinical services rural populations minorities the age of diagnosis is later still which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals of autism whose condition is going to be more severe so I feel that we have a bio ethical imperative the science is there but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact you see and we just can't afford that missed opportunity because children reporters and become adults with autism and we feel that those things that we can do for these children for those families early on will have lifetime consequences for the child for the family and for the community at large so this is our view of autism there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe that there going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism and genetic anomaly is much more than just genes and we actually have a bit of a question here because if there are so many different causes of autism how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome because people like myself when we walk into a play room we recognize the child does have a autism so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity and the answer is what lies in between which is development and in fact we are very interested in those first two years of life because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism autism creates itself where we to be able to intervene during those years of life we might attenuate person and God knows maybe even prevent for others so how do we do that how do we enter that feeling of resonance how do we enter another person's being I remember when I interacted with that 50 month older that the things that came to my mind was how do you how do you come into her world is she thinking about me is she thinking about that'ss well um it's hard to do that so we had to create the technologies we had to basically step inside a body we had to see the world through her eyes and so in the past many years we've been sort of building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with well this is my colleague Warren Jones with whom we've been building this methods the studies for the past 12 years and you see there I'm happy five-month older it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world his mom the caregiver but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his in his day care what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that we had to create this very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies how newborns engage with the world moment by moment what is important and what is not well we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention you're watching a video those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds and we freeze one frame and this is what the typical children are doing in this scan pass in green here are two-year-olds of autism so on that frame the children who are typical are watching this the emotional expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl what are the children of autism doing they are focusing on the revolving door opening and shutting well I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen all in our 5-minute experiments it happens moment by moment in the real lives and their minds are being formed and our brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with the typical peers well we took a construct from our pediatrician friends the concept of growth charts you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and so you have physical height and weight what we decided they were going to create growth charts of social engagement and we saw children from the time that they are born and what you see here on the x-axis is 2 3 4 5 6 months and 9 until about the age of 24 months and this is the percent of their viewing time that they're focusing on people's eyes and this is their growth chart they start over here they love people's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months now let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic it's something very different it starts way up here but that it's a freefall it's very much like they brought into this world a reflex that Orient's them to people but he has no traction it's almost as if that stimulus you you are not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives now we we thought that those data were were so powerful in a way that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life because if you will in turn if you interact with a two and a three month older you be surprised by how social those babies are and what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily and using this kinds of measures and many others what we found out is that our science could in fact identify this condition early on we didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge and the second year of life if we measure things that are evolutionarily highly conserved and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months and that's what we are doing now now we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community now we want those devices of course to be deployed by those who are in the trenches our colleagues the primary care physicians who see every child and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice because they have to see so many children and we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention for treatment we need to be able to work with the families to support the families to manage those first years with them we need to be able to really go from Universal screening to universal access to treatment because those treatments are going to change this children's in those families lives now when we think about what we can't do in those first years I I can tell you having been in this field for so long one feels really rejuvenated there is a sense that the science the one worked on can actually have an impact on reality's preventing in fact those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition no longer we can do a great deal of things and the idea is not to cure autism that's not the idea what we want is to make sure that those individuals of autism can be free from the devastating consequences the comma beta times the profound intellectual disabilities the lack of language the profound profound isolation we feel the individuals of autism in fact have a very special perspective on the world and we need diversity and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength predictable situations situations that can be defined because after all they learn about the world almost like about it rather than learning how to function in it but this is a strength if you're working for example in technology and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities we want them to be free of that we want the next generations of individuals of autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise well thank you for listening to me

is a sense that the science the one worked on can actually have an impact on reality's preventing in fact those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition no longer we can do a great deal of things and the idea is not to cure autism that's not the idea what we want is to make sure that those individuals of autism can be free from the devastating consequences the comma beta times the profound intellectual disabilities the lack of language the profound profound isolation we feel the individuals of autism in fact have a very special perspective on the world and we need diversity and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength predictable situations situations that can be defined because after all they learn about the world almost like about it rather than learning how to function in it but this is a strength if you're working for example in technology and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities we want them to be free of that we want the next generations of individuals of autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise well

**Transcript**:
I always wanted to become a walking on the bar to a social engagement to to resonate other people's feelings thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them as a scientist I always wanted to measure that residence that sense of the other that happened so quickly in a blink of an eye when to its have the people's feelings we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen we're always in the stands of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity we do that all the time we just can't shake it off it's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves to understand the world around them is shaped by that test we are we are social to the core so my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long state hospitals this is a long time ago and for them autism was devastating they had profound intellectual disabilities they didn't talk but most of all they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them from their environment and from the people in fact at the time if you walked into a school for individuals of autism you hear a lot of noise plenty of commotion actions people doing things but they're always doing things by themselves so they may be looking at the light in the ceiling or they may be isolated in the corner or they might be engaged in this repetitive movements in self-stimulatory movements that let them know we're extremely extremely isolated well now we know that autism is this disruption the disruption of this resonance that I'm telling you these are survival skills these are survival skills that we inherited over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of other fragility without the caregiver they wouldn't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with this mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver from the first days and weeks of life babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as they looking at people they look at people's eyes because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away well they oriented the caregiver they can't give a 6 to baby and is out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind the social mind the social brain the panel we always think about autism as as something that happens later on in life it doesn't it begins at the beginning of life as babies engage with caregivers they soon realize that um well there is something in between the ears that is very important is invisible you can't see that is really critical and that thing is called attention and they learn soon enough even before they can utter one word that it can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want they also learn to follow other people's gaze because whatever people are looking at is what they're thinking about and soon enough they start to learn about the meaning of things because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something then I'm just getting a directional cue they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing the attitude and soon enough they start building this body of meanings but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction those are meanings that are acquired as part of their share experiences with others well this is a little 50 month old little girl and she has autism and I am coming so close to her that I'm maybe 2 inches from her face and she's quite oblivious to me imagine if I did that to you and I came 2 inches from your face you do probably two things wouldn't you you would recoil you call the police you do something because it's virtually impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get that reaction we do so remember intuitively effortlessly this is our body wisdom is not something that is mediated by a language our body just knows that and we've known that for a long time and this is not something that happens to humans only it happens to some of our palliative cousins because if you're a monkey and you look at another monkey and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal threat well you are not going to be alive for long so something that in other species our survival mechanisms without them they wouldn't they wouldn't basically live we bring into the context of human beings and this is what we need to simply act act socially now she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her and you think hell maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you well a few minutes later she goes to the corner of the room and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an M&M so I could not attract her attention but something a thing did now most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people now for this girl that division line is not so clear and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences now what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating himself further and further so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic the brain determines we were going to be but in fact the brain also becomes we are and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction this is what's happening with their mind and this is what's happening with a brain well autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders and it's a brain disorder is a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born we now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted now those individuals who don't talk at all there are those individuals who talk too much there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school you see them running the periphery fence of the school day if you let them to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage repeatedly relentlessly but often in an awkward fashion without that immediate resonance well this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time when I started in this field we thought that they were for individuals of autism for 10,000 a very rare condition well now we now it's more like 1 in 100 there are millions of individuals of autism all around the societal cost of this condition is huge in the US alone maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars and you know what most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled individuals who need wraparound services services that are very very intensive and those services can cost in excess of 60 to $80,000 a year those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment because now we know that what doesn't create itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you were we to be able to identify this condition that at earlier point and intervene and treat I can tell you and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past ten years this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition also we have a window of opportunity because the brain is malleable for just so long and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life it's not that that window closes it doesn't but it diminishes considerably and yet the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years and in disadvantaged populations the populations that don't have access to clinical services rural populations minorities the age of diagnosis is later still which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals of autism whose condition is going to be more severe so I feel that we have a bio ethical imperative the science is there but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact you see and we just can't afford that missed opportunity because children reporters and become adults with autism and we feel that those things that we can do for these children for those families early on will have lifetime consequences for the child for the family and for the community at large so this is our view of autism there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe that there going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism and genetic anomaly is much more than just genes and we actually have a bit of a question here because if there are so many different causes of autism how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome because people like myself when we walk into a play room we recognize the child does have a autism so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity and the answer is what lies in between which is development and in fact we are very interested in those first two years of life because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism autism creates itself where we to be able to intervene during those years of life we might attenuate person and God knows maybe even prevent for others so how do we do that how do we enter that feeling of resonance how do we enter another person's being I remember when I interacted with that 50 month older that the things that came to my mind was how do you how do you come into her world is she thinking about me is she thinking about that'ss well um it's hard to do that so we had to create the technologies we had to basically step inside a body we had to see the world through her eyes and so in the past many years we've been sort of building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with well this is my colleague Warren Jones with whom we've been building this methods the studies for the past 12 years and you see there I'm happy five-month older it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world his mom the caregiver but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his in his day care what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that we had to create this very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies how newborns engage with the world moment by moment what is important and what is not well we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention you're watching a video those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds and we freeze one frame and this is what the typical children are doing in this scan pass in green here are two-year-olds of autism so on that frame the children who are typical are watching this the emotional expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl what are the children of autism doing they are focusing on the revolving door opening and shutting well I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen all in our 5-minute experiments it happens moment by moment in the real lives and their minds are being formed and our brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with the typical peers well we took a construct from our pediatrician friends the concept of growth charts you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and so you have physical height and weight what we decided they were going to create growth charts of social engagement and we saw children from the time that they are born and what you see here on the x-axis is 2 3 4 5 6 months and 9 until about the age of 24 months and this is the percent of their viewing time that they're focusing on people's eyes and this is their growth chart they start over here they love people's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months now let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic it's something very different it starts way up here but that it's a freefall it's very much like they brought into this world a reflex that Orient's them to people but he has no traction it's almost as if that stimulus you you are not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives now we we thought that those data were were so powerful in a way that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life because if you will in turn if you interact with a two and a three month older you be surprised by how social those babies are and what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily and using this kinds of measures and many others what we found out is that our science could in fact identify this condition early on we didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge and the second year of life if we measure things that are evolutionarily highly conserved and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months and that's what we are doing now now we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community now we want those devices of course to be deployed by those who are in the trenches our colleagues the primary care physicians who see every child and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice because they have to see so many children and we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention for treatment we need to be able to work with the families to support the families to manage those first years with them we need to be able to really go from Universal screening to universal access to treatment because those treatments are going to change this children's in those families lives now when we think about what we can't do in those first years I I can tell you having been in this field for so long one feels really rejuvenated there

learn about the world almost like about it rather than learning how to function in it but this is a strength if you're working for example in technology and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities we want them to be free of that we want the next generations of individuals of autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise well

stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months now let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic it's something very different it starts way up here but that it's a freefall it's very much like they brought into this world a reflex that Orient's them to people but he has no traction it's almost as if that stimulus you you are not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives now we we thought that those data were were so powerful in a way that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life because if you will in turn if you interact with a two and a three month older you be surprised by how social those babies are and what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily and using this kinds of measures and many others what we found out is that our science could in fact identify this condition early on we didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge and the second year of life if we measure things that are evolutionarily highly conserved and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months and that's what we are doing now now we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community now we want those devices of course to be deployed by those who are in the trenches our colleagues the primary care physicians who see every child and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice because they have to see so many children and we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention for treatment we need to be able to work with the families to support the families to manage those first years with them we need to be able to really go from Universal screening to universal access to treatment because those treatments are going to change this children's in those families lives now when we think about what we can't do in those first years I I can tell you having been in this field for so long one feels really rejuvenated there is a sense that the science the one worked on can actually have an impact on reality's preventing in fact those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition no longer we can do a great deal of things and the idea is not to cure autism that's not the idea what we want is to make sure that those individuals of autism can be free from the devastating consequences the comma beta times the profound intellectual disabilities the lack of language the profound profound isolation we feel the individuals of autism in fact have a very special perspective on the world and we need diversity and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength predictable situations situations that can be defined because after all they learn about the world almost like about it rather than learning how to function in it but this is a strength if you're working for example in technology and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities we want them to be free of that we want the next generations of individuals of autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise well

**Transcript**:
I always wanted to become a walking on the bar to a social engagement to to resonate other people's feelings thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them as a scientist I always wanted to measure that residence that sense of the other that happened so quickly in a blink of an eye when to its have the people's feelings we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen we're always in the stands of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity we do that all the time we just can't shake it off it's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves to understand the world around them is shaped by that test we are we are social to the core so my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long state hospitals this is a long time ago and for them autism was devastating they had profound intellectual disabilities they didn't talk but most of all they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them from their environment and from the people in fact at the time if you walked into a school for individuals of autism you hear a lot of noise plenty of commotion actions people doing things but they're always doing things by themselves so they may be looking at the light in the ceiling or they may be isolated in the corner or they might be engaged in this repetitive movements in self-stimulatory movements that let them know we're extremely extremely isolated well now we know that autism is this disruption the disruption of this resonance that I'm telling you these are survival skills these are survival skills that we inherited over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of other fragility without the caregiver they wouldn't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with this mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver from the first days and weeks of life babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as they looking at people they look at people's eyes because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away well they oriented the caregiver they can't give a 6 to baby and is out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind the social mind the social brain the panel we always think about autism as as something that happens later on in life it doesn't it begins at the beginning of life as babies engage with caregivers they soon realize that um well there is something in between the ears that is very important is invisible you can't see that is really critical and that thing is called attention and they learn soon enough even before they can utter one word that it can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want they also learn to follow other people's gaze because whatever people are looking at is what they're thinking about and soon enough they start to learn about the meaning of things because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something then I'm just getting a directional cue they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing the attitude and soon enough they start building this body of meanings but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction those are meanings that are acquired as part of their share experiences with others well this is a little 50 month old little girl and she has autism and I am coming so close to her that I'm maybe 2 inches from her face and she's quite oblivious to me imagine if I did that to you and I came 2 inches from your face you do probably two things wouldn't you you would recoil you call the police you do something because it's virtually impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get that reaction we do so remember intuitively effortlessly this is our body wisdom is not something that is mediated by a language our body just knows that and we've known that for a long time and this is not something that happens to humans only it happens to some of our palliative cousins because if you're a monkey and you look at another monkey and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal threat well you are not going to be alive for long so something that in other species our survival mechanisms without them they wouldn't they wouldn't basically live we bring into the context of human beings and this is what we need to simply act act socially now she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her and you think hell maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you well a few minutes later she goes to the corner of the room and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an M&M so I could not attract her attention but something a thing did now most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people now for this girl that division line is not so clear and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences now what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating himself further and further so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic the brain determines we were going to be but in fact the brain also becomes we are and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction this is what's happening with their mind and this is what's happening with a brain well autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders and it's a brain disorder is a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born we now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted now those individuals who don't talk at all there are those individuals who talk too much there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school you see them running the periphery fence of the school day if you let them to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage repeatedly relentlessly but often in an awkward fashion without that immediate resonance well this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time when I started in this field we thought that they were for individuals of autism for 10,000 a very rare condition well now we now it's more like 1 in 100 there are millions of individuals of autism all around the societal cost of this condition is huge in the US alone maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars and you know what most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled individuals who need wraparound services services that are very very intensive and those services can cost in excess of 60 to $80,000 a year those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment because now we know that what doesn't create itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you were we to be able to identify this condition that at earlier point and intervene and treat I can tell you and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past ten years this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition also we have a window of opportunity because the brain is malleable for just so long and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life it's not that that window closes it doesn't but it diminishes considerably and yet the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years and in disadvantaged populations the populations that don't have access to clinical services rural populations minorities the age of diagnosis is later still which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals of autism whose condition is going to be more severe so I feel that we have a bio ethical imperative the science is there but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact you see and we just can't afford that missed opportunity because children reporters and become adults with autism and we feel that those things that we can do for these children for those families early on will have lifetime consequences for the child for the family and for the community at large so this is our view of autism there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe that there going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism and genetic anomaly is much more than just genes and we actually have a bit of a question here because if there are so many different causes of autism how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome because people like myself when we walk into a play room we recognize the child does have a autism so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity and the answer is what lies in between which is development and in fact we are very interested in those first two years of life because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism autism creates itself where we to be able to intervene during those years of life we might attenuate person and God knows maybe even prevent for others so how do we do that how do we enter that feeling of resonance how do we enter another person's being I remember when I interacted with that 50 month older that the things that came to my mind was how do you how do you come into her world is she thinking about me is she thinking about that'ss well um it's hard to do that so we had to create the technologies we had to basically step inside a body we had to see the world through her eyes and so in the past many years we've been sort of building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with well this is my colleague Warren Jones with whom we've been building this methods the studies for the past 12 years and you see there I'm happy five-month older it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world his mom the caregiver but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his in his day care what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that we had to create this very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies how newborns engage with the world moment by moment what is important and what is not well we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention you're watching a video those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds and we freeze one frame and this is what the typical children are doing in this scan pass in green here are two-year-olds of autism so on that frame the children who are typical are watching this the emotional expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl what are the children of autism doing they are focusing on the revolving door opening and shutting well I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen all in our 5-minute experiments it happens moment by moment in the real lives and their minds are being formed and our brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with the typical peers well we took a construct from our pediatrician friends the concept of growth charts you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and so you have physical height and weight what we decided they were going to create growth charts of social engagement and we saw children from the time that they are born and what you see here on the x-axis is 2 3 4 5 6 months and 9 until about the age of 24 months and this is the percent of their viewing time that they're focusing on people's eyes and this is their growth chart they start over here they love people's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months now let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic it's something very different it starts way up here but that it's a freefall it's very much like they brought into this world a reflex that Orient's them to people but he has no traction it's almost as if that stimulus you you are not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives now we we thought that those data were were so powerful in a way that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life because if you will in turn if you interact with a two and a three month older you be surprised by how social those babies are and what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily and using this kinds of measures and many others what we found out is that our science could in fact identify this condition early on we didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge and the second year of life if we measure things that are evolutionarily highly conserved and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months and that's what we are doing now now we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community now we want those devices of course to be deployed by those who are in the trenches our colleagues the primary care physicians who see every child and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice because they have to see so many children and we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention for treatment we need to be able to work with the

learn about the world almost like about it rather than learning how to function in it but this is a strength if you're working for example in technology and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities we want them to be free of that we want the next generations of individuals of autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise well

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] 15 years ago it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life back then 15 years ago we didn't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and Development Across the lifespan in the past decade or so mainly due to advances in brain imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging or MRI neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages and to track changes in brain structure and brain function so we use structural MRI if you like to take a snapshot a photograph at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain and we can ask questions like how much gray matter does does the brain contain and how does that change with age and we also use functional MRI called fmri to take a video a movie of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something so many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development but by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood and instead the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the 20s and 30s so adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological hormonal physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable independent role in society it can go on a long time one of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex so this is uh this is a model of the human brain and this is prefrontal cortex right at the front prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area it's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions things like decisionmaking planning planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year inhibiting inappropriate behav Behavior so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid it's also involved in social interaction understanding other people and self-awareness so MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence so if you look at gry matter volume for example gry matter volume across age from Age 4 to 22 years increases during childhood which is what you can see on this graph it PE peaks in early adolescence the arrows indicate Peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex you can see that that Peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls and that's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average and then during adolescence there's a significant decline in gry matter volume in prefrontal cortex now that might sound bad but actually this is a really important developmental process because gray matter contains cell bodies and connections between cells the copses and this decline in gry matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning the elimination of unwanted synapses this is a really important process it's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in in that synapses that are being used are strengthened and copses that aren't being used in that particular environment are pruned away you can think of it a bit like pruning a rose bush you prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining important branches can grow stronger and this process which effectively fine tunes brain tissue according to the species specific environment is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions During the period of human adolesence so a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the Adolescent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age so I'll just give you an example from my lab so my lab we're interested in the social brain that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people so I like to show a a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work so this is a soccer game Michael Owen has just missed a goal and he's lying on the ground and the first aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic and instinctive social emotional responses are so within a split second of Mich Owen missing this goal everyone is doing the same thing with their arms and the same thing with their face even mik Owen as he slides along the grass is doing the same thing with his arms and presumably has a similar facial expression and the only people who don't are the guys in yellow at the back and I I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium and they're doing another social emotional response that we all instantly recognize and that's the second aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates how good we are at reading other people Behavior their actions their gestures their facial expressions in terms of their underlying emotions and mental States so you don't have to ask any of these guys you have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling and thinking at this precise moment in time so that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab so we in my lab we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people their minds their mental States their emotions and one of the findings that we've found several times now as have other labs around the world is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex which is shown in Blue on the slide and it's um right in the middle of prefrontal Cortex in the in the midline of your head this region is more active in adolescence when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults and this is actually a metaanalysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world and they all show the same thing that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decre increases during the period of adolescence and we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach a different cognitive strategy to make social decisions and one way of looking at that is to do Behavioral Studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of Behavioral task and I'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab so imagine that you're the participant in one of our experiments you come to the lab you see this computerized task in the this task you see a set of shelves now there are objects on these shelves on some of them and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set of shelves and there are some objects that he can't see they're occluded from his point of view with a kind of gray piece of wood this is the same set of shelves from his point of view notice that there are only some objects that he can see whereas there are many more objects that you can see now your task is to move objects around the director standing behind the set of shells is going to direct you to move objects around but remember he's not going to ask you to move objects that he can't see this introduces a really interesting condition whereby there's a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director's perspective so imagine he tells you to move the top truck left there are three trucks there you're going to instinctively go for the white truck cuz that's the top truck from your perspective but then you have to remember oh he can't see that truck so he must mean me to move the blue truck which is the top truck from his perspective now believe it or not normal healthy intelligent adults like you make errors about 50% of the time on that kind of trial they move the white truck instead of the blue truck so we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults and we also have a control condition where there's no director and instead we give people a rule we tell them okay we're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there's no director instead you've got to ignore objects with a dark gray background you'll see that this is exactly the same condition only in the no director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule whereas in the director condition they have to remember to take into account the director's perspective in order to guide their ongoing Behavior okay so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood and what you're going to see is a percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions so the gray is the direct dor condition and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50% of the time whereas they make far fewer errors when there's no director present when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background developmentally these two conditions develop in exactly the same way between late childhood and midadolescence there's an improvement in other words a reduction of errors in both of these trials in both of these conditions but it's when you compare the last two groups the mid-adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting because there there is no continued Improvement in the no direct condition in other words everything you need to do to in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence whereas in contrast if you look at the last two gray bars there's still a significant Improvement in the directed condition between midadolescence and adulthood and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing Behavior which is something by the way that we do in everyday life all the time time is still developing in mid to late adolescence so if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you think you sometimes think they have problems taking other people's perspectives you're right they do and this is why so we we sometimes um laugh about teenagers we they're parodied sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage Behavior they take risks they're sometimes Moody they're very self-conscious I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine who said that the thing he noticed most about his teenage daughters before and after puberty was their level of embarrassment in front of him so he said before puberty if my two daughters were messing around in a shop I'd say hey stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing their favorite song after puberty that became the threat the very notion of their dad singing in public was enough to make them behave so people often ask well is adolescence a kind of recent phenomena is it something we've invented recently in the west and actually the answer is probably not there are lots of descriptions of adolescence in in history that sound very similar to the descriptions we Ed today so there's a famous uh quote by Shakespeare from the Winters Tale where he describes adolescence as follows I would there were no age between 10 and 3 and 20 or that youth would sleep out the rest for there's nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging the ancient tree stealing fighting he then goes on to say having said that would any but these boiled brains of 19 and 2 and20 hunt in this weather so almost 400 years ago Shakespeare was portraying Adolescence in a very similar light to the light that we portray them in today but today we try to understand their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain so for example take risk-taking we know that adoles an are have a tendency to take risks they do they take more risks than children or adults and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they're with their friends there's a important drive to become independent from one's parents and to impress one's friends in adolescence but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the lyic system so I'm going to show you the lyic system in red in the slide behind me and also on this brain so the lyic system is Right deep inside the brain and it's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing it gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things including taking risks it gives you the kick out of taking risks and this region the the regions within the lyic system have been found to be hyper sensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults and at the very same time the prefrontal cortex which you can see in blue in the slide here which stops us taking excessive risks is still very much in development in adolescence so brain research has shown that the Adolescent brain undergoes really quite profound development and this has implications for education for rehabilitation and intervention the environment including teaching can and does shape the developing adolescent brain and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been routinely educating teenagers in the west all four of my grandparents for examp example left school in their early adolescence they had no choice and that's still the case for many many teenagers around the world today 40% of teenagers don't have access to secondary school education and yet this is a period of life where the brain is particularly adaptable and malleable it's a fantastic opportunity for Learning and creativity so what's sometimes seen as the problem with adolescence heightened risk-taking poor impul s control self-consciousness shouldn't be stigmatized it actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and Social Development thank [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] 15 years ago it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life back then 15 years ago we didn't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and Development Across the lifespan in the past decade or so mainly due to advances in brain imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging or MRI neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages and to track changes in brain structure and brain function so we use structural MRI if you like to take a snapshot a photograph at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain and we can ask questions like how much gray matter does does the brain contain and how does that change with age and we also use functional MRI called fmri to take a video a movie of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something so many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development but by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood and instead the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the 20s and 30s so adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological hormonal physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable independent role in society it can go on a long time one of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex so this is uh this is a model of the human brain and this is prefrontal cortex right at the front prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area it's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions things like decisionmaking planning planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year inhibiting inappropriate behav Behavior so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid it's also involved in social interaction understanding other people and self-awareness so MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence so if you look at gry matter volume for example gry matter volume across age from Age 4 to 22 years increases during childhood which is what you can see on this graph it PE peaks in early adolescence the arrows indicate Peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex you can see that that Peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls and that's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average and then during adolescence there's a significant decline in gry matter volume in prefrontal cortex now that might sound bad but actually this is a really important developmental process because gray matter contains cell bodies and connections between cells the copses and this decline in gry matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning the elimination of unwanted synapses this is a really important process it's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in in that synapses that are being used are strengthened and copses that aren't being used in that particular environment are pruned away you can think of it a bit like pruning a rose bush you prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining important branches can grow stronger and this process which effectively fine tunes brain tissue according to the species specific environment is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions During the period of human adolesence so a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the Adolescent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age so I'll just give you an example from my lab so my lab we're interested in the social brain that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people so I like to show a a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work so this is a soccer game Michael Owen has just missed a goal and he's lying on the ground and the first aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic and instinctive social emotional responses are so within a split second of Mich Owen missing this goal everyone is doing the same thing with their arms and the same thing with their face even mik Owen as he slides along the grass is doing the same thing with his arms and presumably has a similar facial expression and the only people who don't are the guys in yellow at the back and I I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium and they're doing another social emotional response that we all instantly recognize and that's the second aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates how good we are at reading other people Behavior their actions their gestures their facial expressions in terms of their underlying emotions and mental States so you don't have to ask any of these guys you have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling and thinking at this precise moment in time so that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab so we in my lab we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people their minds their mental States their emotions and one of the findings that we've found several times now as have other labs around the world is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex which is shown in Blue on the slide and it's um right in the middle of prefrontal Cortex in the in the midline of your head this region is more active in adolescence when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults and this is actually a metaanalysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world and they all show the same thing that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decre increases during the period of adolescence and we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach a different cognitive strategy to make social decisions and one way of looking at that is to do Behavioral Studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of Behavioral task and I'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab so imagine that you're the participant in one of our experiments you come to the lab you see this computerized task in the this task you see a set of shelves now there are objects on these shelves on some of them and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set of shelves and there are some objects that he can't see they're occluded from his point of view with a kind of gray piece of wood this is the same set of shelves from his point of view notice that there are only some objects that he can see whereas there are many more objects that you can see now your task is to move objects around the director standing behind the set of shells is going to direct you to move objects around but remember he's not going to ask you to move objects that he can't see this introduces a really interesting condition whereby there's a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director's perspective so imagine he tells you to move the top truck left there are three trucks there you're going to instinctively go for the white truck cuz that's the top truck from your perspective but then you have to remember oh he can't see that truck so he must mean me to move the blue truck which is the top truck from his perspective now believe it or not normal healthy intelligent adults like you make errors about 50% of the time on that kind of trial they move the white truck instead of the blue truck so we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults and we also have a control condition where there's no director and instead we give people a rule we tell them okay we're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there's no director instead you've got to ignore objects with a dark gray background you'll see that this is exactly the same condition only in the no director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule whereas in the director condition they have to remember to take into account the director's perspective in order to guide their ongoing Behavior okay so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood and what you're going to see is a percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions so the gray is the direct dor condition and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50% of the time whereas they make far fewer errors when there's no director present when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background developmentally these two conditions develop in exactly the same way between late childhood and midadolescence there's an improvement in other words a reduction of errors in both of these trials in both of these conditions but it's when you compare the last two groups the mid-adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting because there there is no continued Improvement in the no direct condition in other words everything you need to do to in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence whereas in contrast if you look at the last two gray bars there's still a significant Improvement in the directed condition between midadolescence and adulthood and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing Behavior which is something by the way that we do in everyday life all the time time is still developing in mid to late adolescence so if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you think you sometimes think they have problems taking other people's perspectives you're right they do and this is why so we we sometimes um laugh about teenagers we they're parodied sometimes even demonized in the media for

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] 15 years ago it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life back then 15 years ago we didn't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and Development Across the lifespan in the past decade or so mainly due to advances in brain imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging or MRI neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages and to track changes in brain structure and brain function so we use structural MRI if you like to take a snapshot a photograph at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain and we can ask questions like how much gray matter does does the brain contain and how does that change with age and we also use functional MRI called fmri to take a video a movie of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something so many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development but by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood and instead the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the 20s and 30s so adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological hormonal physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable independent role in society it can go on a long time one of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex so this is uh this is a model of the human brain and this is prefrontal cortex right at the front prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area it's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions things like decisionmaking planning planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year inhibiting inappropriate behav Behavior so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid it's also involved in social interaction understanding other people and self-awareness so MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence so if you look at gry matter volume for example gry matter volume across age from Age 4 to 22 years increases during childhood which is what you can see on this graph it PE peaks in early adolescence the arrows indicate Peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex you can see that that Peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls and that's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average and then during adolescence there's a significant decline in gry matter volume in prefrontal cortex now that might sound bad but actually this is a really important developmental process because gray matter contains cell bodies and connections between cells the copses and this decline in gry matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning the elimination of unwanted synapses this is a really important process it's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in in that synapses that are being used are strengthened and copses that aren't being used in that particular environment are pruned away you can think of it a bit like pruning a rose bush you prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining important branches can grow stronger and this process which effectively fine tunes brain tissue according to the species specific environment is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions During the period of human adolesence so a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the Adolescent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age so I'll just give you an example from my lab so my lab we're interested in the social brain that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people so I like to show a a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work so this is a soccer game Michael Owen has just missed a goal and he's lying on the ground and the first aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic and instinctive social emotional responses are so within a split second of Mich Owen missing this goal everyone is doing the same thing with their arms and the same thing with their face even mik Owen as he slides along the grass is doing the same thing with his arms and presumably has a similar facial expression and the only people who don't are the guys in yellow at the back and I I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium and they're doing another social emotional response that we all instantly recognize and that's the second aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates how good we are at reading other people Behavior their actions their gestures their facial expressions in terms of their underlying emotions and mental States so you don't have to ask any of these guys you have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling and thinking at this precise moment in time so that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab so we in my lab we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people their minds their mental States their emotions and one of the findings that we've found several times now as have other labs around the world is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex which is shown in Blue on the slide and it's um right in the middle of prefrontal Cortex in the in the midline of your head this region is more active in adolescence when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults and this is actually a metaanalysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world and they all show the same thing that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decre increases during the period of adolescence and we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach a different cognitive strategy to make social decisions and one way of looking at that is to do Behavioral Studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of Behavioral task and I'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab so imagine that you're the participant in one of our experiments you come to the lab you see this computerized task in the this task you see a set of shelves now there are objects on these shelves on some of them and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set of shelves and there are some objects that he can't see they're occluded from his point of view with a kind of gray piece of wood this is the same set of shelves from his point of view notice that there are only some objects that he can see whereas there are many more objects that you can see now your task is to move objects around the director standing behind the set of shells is going to direct you to move objects around but remember he's not going to ask you to move objects that he can't see this introduces a really interesting condition whereby there's a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director's perspective so imagine he tells you to move the top truck left there are three trucks there you're going to instinctively go for the white truck cuz that's the top truck from your perspective but then you have to remember oh he can't see that truck so he must mean me to move the blue truck which is the top truck from his perspective now believe it or not normal healthy intelligent adults like you make errors about 50% of the time on that kind of trial they move the white truck instead of the blue truck so we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults and we also have a control condition where there's no director and instead we give people a rule we tell them okay we're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there's no director instead you've got to ignore objects with a dark gray background you'll see that this is exactly the same condition only in the no director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule whereas in the director condition they have to remember to take into account the director's perspective in order to guide their ongoing Behavior okay so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood and what you're going to see is a percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions so the gray is the direct dor condition and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50% of the time whereas they make far fewer errors when there's no director present when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background developmentally these two conditions develop in exactly the same way between late childhood and midadolescence there's an improvement in other words a reduction of errors in both of these trials in both of these conditions but it's when you compare the last two groups the mid-adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting because there there is no continued Improvement in the no direct condition in other words everything you need to do to in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence whereas in contrast if you look at the last two gray bars there's still a significant Improvement in the directed condition between midadolescence and adulthood and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing Behavior which is something by the way that we do in everyday life all the time time is still developing in mid to late adolescence so if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you think you sometimes think they have problems taking other people's perspectives you're right they do and this is why so we we sometimes um laugh about teenagers we they're parodied sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage Behavior they take risks they're sometimes Moody they're very self-conscious I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine who said that the thing he noticed most about his teenage daughters before and after puberty was their level of embarrassment in front of him so he said before puberty if my two daughters were messing around in a shop I'd say hey stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing their favorite song after puberty that became the threat the very notion of their dad singing in public was enough to make them behave so people often ask well is adolescence a kind of recent phenomena is it something we've invented recently in the west and actually the answer is probably not there are lots of descriptions of adolescence in in history that sound very similar to the descriptions we Ed today so there's a famous uh quote by Shakespeare from the Winters Tale where he describes adolescence as follows I would there were no age between 10 and 3 and 20 or that youth would sleep out the rest for there's nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging the ancient tree stealing fighting he then goes on to say having said that would any but these boiled brains of 19 and 2 and20 hunt in this weather so almost 400 years ago Shakespeare was portraying Adolescence in a very similar light to the light that we portray them in today but today we try to understand their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain so for example take risk-taking we know that adoles an are have a tendency to take risks they do they take more risks than children or adults and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they're with their friends there's a important drive to become independent from one's parents and to impress one's friends in adolescence but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the lyic system so I'm going to show you the lyic system in red in the slide behind me and also on this brain so the lyic system is Right deep inside the brain and it's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing it gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things including taking risks it gives you the kick out of taking risks and this region the the regions within the lyic system have been found to be hyper sensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults and at the very same time the prefrontal cortex which you can see in blue in the slide here which stops us taking excessive risks is still very much in development in adolescence so brain research has shown that the Adolescent brain undergoes really quite profound development and this has implications for education for rehabilitation and intervention the environment including teaching can and does shape the developing adolescent brain and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been routinely educating teenagers in the west all four of my grandparents for examp example left school in their early adolescence they had no choice and that's still the case for many many teenagers around the world today 40% of teenagers don't have access to secondary school education and yet this is a period of life where the brain is particularly adaptable and malleable it's a fantastic opportunity for Learning and creativity so what's sometimes seen as the problem with adolescence heightened risk-taking poor impul s control self-consciousness

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby We often hear that studying literature involves finding a deeper meaning to a text. When writing about literary works, we're expected to mentally dive below the surface in order to come back up with big ideas. But you may find yourself looking at the flat page of a book, wondering how deep it can really go? How do we reach those ideas that turn into great essays? Well, there are two crucial thinking steps that can lead us in the right direction: practicing insight and acknowledging complexity. Insight is the ability to arrive at an intuitive understanding of a big idea using only small clues to get there. If you're practicing insight, you'll able to use observations about character behavior to figure out their true emotions and motivations. Pay attention to little things because they add up to what is really meaningful. For example, if you consider a character like Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice, who openly declares his dislike for Miss Lizzy Bennet, you might, at first, assume he's just a mean guy. But, using your powers of insight, you're noticing other smaller things - how Darcy's eyes linger on Lizzy's face and how he seems all flustered when she's around. Add to the mix your knowledge that Mr. Darcy is in a much higher social class than Lizzy, and your sense of insight should be telling you that there's something more here. In this case, it will tell you that Darcy's surface behavior is in conflict with his true feelings of attraction because the difference in wealth between himself and Lizzy makes him feel that it'll never work. Thinking about all those small clues gives us insight about some of the big, abstract ideas within the novel that we can approach in an essay: appearances versus reality, the power of wealth and social stratification, and the unpredictable nature of love and attraction. Look at that! Deeper meaning. The second step to a sophisticated analysis is acknowledging complexity. Let's face it. In both life and literature, situations are complicated due to social forces like relationships, moral codes, personal desires, and power structures. This means that there are, at any given time, multiple factors that shape what is true. In order to acknowledge complexity in your writing, refrain from making broad generalizations about a text or establishing quick, simple judgements about a character. Explore each facet of your subject carefully and make sure to consider multiple influences on events. Explain the tension of multiple forces that create the story. For example, a basic analysis of Toni Morrison's Beloved, where the protagonist has killed her own child rather than allow her to grow up in slavery, might sound like this, "Sethe murdered her own daughter. This act was wrong, and causes the ghost of the child to haunt her throughout the novel." These observations are simplistic. They don't acknowledge all the different forces that contribute to what the character has done. Try something like this instead, "A culture of slavery disturbs the ability to determine what is morally right. Sethe's past experiences with violence reinforce the fear she has for her child's fate, and transform the murder into a protective act. As the novel progresses, Sethe is haunted both by the angry spirit of her daughter and by the memories of everything else slavery took from her." Here, we see those influential forces at work, and we've shown off our ability to understand the complicated nature of the human experience, which, again, allows us to access those big ideas that reveal the deeper meaning of a story, ideas, in this case, like the parameters of maternal instinct, the consequences of injustice, and the question of whether or not ethics can even exist in a corrupted moral system. It's impossible to sit down and write an amazing essay about literature without first thinking about it. Before you hit the keys, go back to the text and fish out the small moments, the complicated moments in the story. Line them up in your mind, practice insight, acknowledge complexity, arrive at some big ideas. Before you know it, the deeper meaning will be close at hand.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby We often hear that studying literature involves finding a deeper meaning to a text. When writing about literary works, we're expected to mentally dive below the surface in order to come back up with big ideas. But you may find yourself looking at the flat page of a book, wondering how deep it can really go? How do we reach those ideas that turn into great essays? Well, there are two crucial thinking steps that can lead us in the right direction: practicing insight and acknowledging complexity. Insight is the ability to arrive at an intuitive understanding of a big idea using only small clues to get there. If you're practicing insight, you'll able to use observations about character behavior to figure out their true emotions and motivations. Pay attention to little things because they add up to what is really meaningful. For example, if you consider a character like Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice, who openly declares his dislike for Miss Lizzy Bennet, you might, at first, assume he's just a mean guy. But, using your powers of insight, you're noticing other smaller things - how Darcy's eyes linger on Lizzy's face and how he seems all flustered when she's around. Add to the mix your knowledge that Mr. Darcy is in a much higher social class than Lizzy, and your sense of insight should be telling you that there's something more here. In this case, it will tell you that Darcy's surface behavior is in conflict with his true feelings of attraction because the difference in wealth between himself and Lizzy makes him feel that it'll never work. Thinking about all those small clues gives us insight about some of the big, abstract ideas within the novel that we can approach in an essay: appearances versus reality, the power of wealth and social stratification, and the unpredictable nature of love and attraction. Look at that! Deeper meaning. The second step to a sophisticated analysis is acknowledging complexity. Let's face it. In both life and literature, situations are complicated due to social forces like relationships, moral codes, personal desires, and power structures. This means that there are, at any given time, multiple factors that shape what is true. In order to acknowledge complexity in your writing, refrain from making broad generalizations about a text or establishing quick, simple judgements about a character. Explore each facet of your subject carefully and make sure to consider multiple influences on events. Explain the tension of multiple forces that create the story. For example, a basic analysis of Toni Morrison's Beloved, where the protagonist has killed her own child rather than allow her to grow up in slavery, might sound like this, "Sethe murdered her own daughter. This act was wrong, and causes the ghost of the child to haunt her throughout the novel." These observations are simplistic. They don't acknowledge all the different forces that contribute to what the character has done. Try something like this instead, "A culture of slavery disturbs the ability to determine what is morally right. Sethe's past experiences with violence reinforce the fear she has for her child's fate, and transform the murder into a protective act. As the novel progresses, Sethe is haunted both by the angry spirit of her daughter and by the memories of everything else slavery took from her." Here, we see those influential forces at work, and we've shown off our ability to understand the complicated nature of the human experience, which, again, allows us to access those big ideas that reveal the deeper meaning of a story, ideas, in this case, like the parameters of maternal instinct, the consequences of injustice, and the question of whether or not ethics can even exist in a corrupted moral system. It's impossible to sit down and write an amazing essay about literature without first thinking about it. Before you hit the keys, go back to the text and fish out the small moments, the complicated moments in the story. Line them up in your mind, practice insight, acknowledge complexity, arrive at some big ideas. Before you know it, the deeper meaning will be close at hand.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby How big was that fish you caught? This big? This big? This big? Without photographic evidence, there's nothing that proves you caught a whopper, and that's been true since the dawn of fishing. In fact, hundreds of years ago, long before photography could capture the moment, Japanese fishermen invented their own way to record trophy catches. They called it Gyotaku. Gyotaku is the ancient art of printing fish that originated in Japan as a way to record trophy catches prior to the modern day camera. Gyo means fish and taku means impression. There are several different stories about how Gyotaku came about, but it basically started with fishermen needing a way to record the species and size of the fish they caught over 100 years ago. Fishermen took paper, ink, and brushes out to sea with them. They told stories of great adventures at sea. Since the Japanese revered certain fish, the fishermen would take a rubbing from these fish and release them. To make the rubbing, they would paint the fish with non-toxic sumi-e ink and print them on rice paper. This way they could be released or cleaned and sold at market. The first prints like this were for records only with no extra details. It wasn't until the mid 1800's that they began painting eye details and other embellishments onto the prints. One famous nobleman, Lord Sakai, was an avid fisherman, and, when he made a large catch, he wanted to preserve the memory of the large, red sea bream. To do so, he commissioned a fisherman to print his catch. After this, many fisherman would bring their Gyotaku prints to Lord Sakai, and if he liked their work, he would hire them to print for him. Many prints hung in the palace during the Edo period. After this period, Gyotaku was not as popular and began to fade away. Today, Gyotaku has become a popular art form, enjoyed by many. And the prints are said to bring good luck to the fishermen. But the art form is quite different than it used to be. Most artists today learn on their own by trial and error. Before the artist begins to print, the fish needs to be prepared for printing. First, the artist places the fish on a hollowed out surface. Then the artist spreads the fins out and pins them down on the board to dry. They then clean the fish with water. When it comes time to print, there are two different methods. The indirect method begins with pasting moist fabric or paper onto the fish using rice paste. Then, the artist uses a tompo, or a cotton ball covered in silk, to put ink on the fabric or paper to produce the print. This method requires more skill and great care needs to be taken when pulling the paper off the fish so the paper doesn't tear. In the direct method, the artist paints directly on the fish, and then gently presses the moist fabric or paper into the fish. With both of these methods, no two prints are exactly alike, but both reveal dramatic images of the fish. For the final touch, the artist uses a chop, or a stamp, and signs their work, and can hold it up to say, "The fish was exactly this big!"

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What was the original purpose for gyotaku?
Options: A. A unique style of fishing developed in ancient Japan, B. Japanese fishermen used this method to record transactions with foreign tradesmen, C. A tool used to catch fish in the waters around Japan, D. Japanese fishermen recorded the size of their catch
Correct Option: D

Without photographic evidence, there's nothing that proves you caught a whopper, and that's been true since the dawn of fishing. In fact, hundreds of years ago, long before photography could capture the moment, Japanese fishermen invented their own way to record trophy catches. They called it Gyotaku. Gyotaku is the ancient art of printing fish that originated in Japan as a way to record trophy catches prior to the modern day camera. Gyo means fish and taku means impression. There are several different stories about how Gyotaku came about, but it basically started with fishermen needing a way to record the species and size of the fish they caught over 100 years ago. Fishermen took paper, ink, and brushes out to sea with them. They told stories of great adventures at sea. Since the Japanese revered certain fish, the fishermen would take a rubbing from these fish and release them. To make the rubbing, they would paint the fish with non-toxic sumi-e ink and print them on rice paper. This way they could be released or cleaned and sold at market. The first prints like this were for records only with no extra details. It wasn't until the mid 1800's that they began painting eye details and other embellishments onto the prints. One famous nobleman, Lord Sakai, was an avid fisherman, and, when he made a large catch, he wanted to preserve the memory of the large, red sea bream. To do so, he commissioned a fisherman to print his catch. After this, many fisherman would bring their Gyotaku prints to Lord Sakai, and if he liked their work, he would hire them to print for him. Many prints hung in the palace during the Edo period. After this period, Gyotaku was not as popular and began to fade away. Today, Gyotaku has become a popular art form, enjoyed by many. And the prints are said to bring good luck to the fishermen. But the art form is quite different than it used to be. Most artists today learn on their own by trial and error. Before the artist begins to print, the fish needs to be prepared for printing. First, the artist places the fish on a hollowed out surface. Then the artist spreads the fins out and pins them down on the board to dry. They then clean the fish with water. When it comes time to print, there are two different methods. The indirect method begins with pasting moist fabric or paper onto the fish using rice paste. Then, the artist uses a tompo, or a cotton ball covered in silk, to put ink on the fabric or paper to produce the print. This method requires more skill and great care needs to be taken when pulling the paper off the fish so the paper doesn't tear. In the direct method, the artist paints directly on the fish, and then gently presses the moist fabric or paper into the fish. With both of these methods, no two prints are exactly alike, but both reveal dramatic images of the fish. For the final touch, the artist uses a chop, or a stamp, and signs their work, and can hold it up to say, "The fish was exactly this big!"

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The next time you see a news report of a hurricane or a tropical storm showing high winds battering trees and houses, ask yourself, "How did the wind get going so fast?" Amazingly enough, this is a motion that started more than five billion years ago. But, to understand why, we need to understand spin. In physics, we talk about two types of motion. The first is straight-line motion. You push on something, and it moves forward. The second type, spin, involves an object rotating, or turning on its axis in place. An object in straight-line motion will move forever unless something, like the friction of the ground beneath it, causes it to slow down and stop. The same thing happens when you get something spinning. It will keep on spinning until something stops it. But the spin can speed up. If an ice skater is gliding across the ice in straight-line motion and she pulls her arms in, she keeps on gliding at the same speed. But if she is spinning on the ice and she pulls her arms in, you know what happens next. She spins faster. This is called the conservation of angular momentum. Mathematically, angular momentum is a product of two numbers, one that gives the spin rate and one that gives the distance of the mass from the axis. If something is freely spinning, as one number gets bigger, the other gets smaller. Arms closer, spin faster. Arms farther, spin slower. Spin causes other effects, too. If you are riding on a spinning merry-go-round and you toss a ball to a friend, it will appear to follow a curving path. It doesn't actually curve, though. It really goes in a straight line. You were the one who was following a curving path, but, from your point of view, the ball appears to curve. We call this the coriolis effect. Oh, and you are riding on a speeding merry-go-round right now at this very moment. We call it the Earth. The Earth spins on its axis once each day. But why does the Earth spin? Now, that's a story that starts billions of years ago. A cloud of dust and gas that form the Sun and the Earth and the planets and you and me started to collapse as gravity pulled it all together. Before it started to collapse, this cloud had a very gentle spin. And, as it collapsed, like that ice skater pulling her arms in, the spin got faster and faster. And everything that formed out of the cloud, the Sun and the planets around the Sun and the moons around the planets, all inherited this spin. And this inherited spin is what gives us night and day. And this day-night cycle is what drives our weather. The Earth is warm on the daytime side, cool on the nighttime side, and it's warmer at the equator than at the poles. The differences in temperature make differences in air pressure, and the differences in air pressure make air move. They make the wind blow. But, because the Earth spins, the moving air curves to the right in the Northern Hemisphere because of the coriolis effect. If there's a region of low pressure in the atmosphere, air is pushed toward it, like water going down a drain. But the air curves to the right as it goes, and this gives it a spin. With the dramatic low pressure in a storm, the air gets pulled in tighter and tighter, so it gets going faster and faster, and this is how we get the high winds of a hurricane. So, when you see a spinning storm on a weather report, think about this: The spin ultimately came from the spin of the Earth, and the Earth's spin is a remnant, a fossil relic, of the gentle spin of the cloud of dust and gas that collapsed to make the Earth some five billion years ago. You are watching something, the spin, that is older than dirt, that's older than rocks, that's older than the Earth itself.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The next time you see a news report of a hurricane or a tropical storm showing high winds battering trees and houses, ask yourself, "How did the wind get going so fast?" Amazingly enough, this is a motion that started more than five billion years ago. But, to understand why, we need to understand spin. In physics, we talk about two types of motion. The first is straight-line motion. You push on something, and it moves forward. The second type, spin, involves an object rotating, or turning on its axis in place. An object in straight-line motion will move forever unless something, like the friction of the ground beneath it, causes it to slow down and stop. The same thing happens when you get something spinning. It will keep on spinning until something stops it. But the spin can speed up. If an ice skater is gliding across the ice in straight-line motion and she pulls her arms in, she keeps on gliding at the same speed. But if she is spinning on the ice and she pulls her arms in, you know what happens next. She spins faster. This is called the conservation of angular momentum. Mathematically, angular momentum is a product of two numbers, one that gives the spin rate and one that gives the distance of the mass from the axis. If something is freely spinning, as one number gets bigger, the other gets smaller. Arms closer, spin faster. Arms farther, spin slower. Spin causes other effects, too. If you are riding on a spinning merry-go-round and you toss a ball to a friend, it will appear to follow a curving path. It doesn't actually curve, though. It really goes in a straight line. You were the one who was following a curving path, but, from your point of view, the ball appears to curve. We call this the coriolis effect. Oh, and you are riding on a speeding merry-go-round right now at this very moment. We call it the Earth. The Earth spins on its axis once each day. But why does the Earth spin? Now, that's a story that starts billions of years ago. A cloud of dust and gas that form the Sun and the Earth and the planets and you and me started to collapse as gravity pulled it all together. Before it started to collapse, this cloud had a very gentle spin. And, as it collapsed, like that ice skater pulling her arms in, the spin got faster and faster. And everything that formed out of the cloud, the Sun and the planets around the Sun and the moons around the planets, all inherited this spin. And this inherited spin is what gives us night and day. And this day-night cycle is what drives our weather. The Earth is warm on the daytime side, cool on the nighttime side, and it's warmer at the equator than at the poles. The differences in temperature make differences in air pressure, and the differences in air pressure make air move. They make the wind blow. But, because the Earth spins, the moving air curves to the right in the Northern Hemisphere because of the coriolis effect. If there's a region of low pressure in the atmosphere, air is pushed toward it, like water going down a drain. But the air curves to the right as it goes, and this gives it a spin. With the dramatic low pressure in a storm, the air gets pulled in tighter and tighter, so it gets going faster and faster, and this is how we get the high winds of a hurricane. So, when you see a spinning storm on a weather report, think about this: The spin ultimately came from the spin of the Earth, and the Earth's spin is a remnant, a fossil relic, of the gentle spin of the cloud of dust and gas that collapsed to make the Earth some five billion years ago. You are watching something, the spin, that is older than dirt, that's older than rocks, that's older than the Earth itself.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The healthy liver cell divides only when it's stressed. The healthy hair cell divides frequently. And the cancer cell divides even more frequently and recklessly. "The first draft that I saw was, like, four days before it was supposed to go online or something like that, and I hadn't heard, you know I hadn't heard, so, I was like, 'Hey, guys, just wondering if you need me for anything?' You know? And so she floods my inbox with emails, being like, 'Yes, we actually need you for a bunch of stuff!' And it was great. Like, when I first saw it, I mean, you immediately get the whole natural versus unnatural technique." "Not good for you?" "Right, yes, there you go, good for you and not good for you. Seeing that, actually, was really cool because, I mean, I had no idea. Writing the script, you have no idea what it's going to turn out like in the end. But you get this, like, intuitive feel of 'Okay, like, yeah, I get why this is a cancer cell, and I get why this is a healthy cell.' And, actually, I showed it to, I showed an early draft to the professor with whom I was fact-checking the script who is a cancer researcher at MIT, and he said that it was one of the best visualizations of cancer cells that he'd ever seen. So, that was really cool to hear as well." "When you get a script, do you make a storyboard or not?" "I guess it depends on the method that we use to produce the piece because, for example, things that would definitely be character-heavy, like 'Ladder of Inference', we worked with a storyboard from beginning to end because we were dealing with character animation. And something like that is much different than stop-motion, for example. But, also, I mean Biljana and I have also worked together for, like, nearly ten years or something absurd so we don't need as much of a, you know, a piece of paper to tell us what to do, whereas, if I were working with someone new, then I would really want to work with a storyboard, but we kind of trust each other." "So, you, like, finish... ...each other's sentences." "We can try that again." "No, we definitely shouldn't use that, it's too cheesy." "So, there was a part in the video where we had to represent how the cells reproduce and how chemotherapy affects it. And it became quite complicated for me to visualize, so I actually had to ask you to draw little doodles for me to actually explain that. How was that for you? How was that experience?" "I mean, it was pretty difficult for me to visualize, too, so, it was interesting. Doing the storyboard actually helped me clarify in my head, like, how it actually works because when you have to explain something to someone else, with anything, obviously, you have to, like, really figure it out yourself. And, then, when you have to draw it, that requires you to take an extra level of abstraction and figure out, like, okay, like, what are the parts of this drawing that are really important? What do I have to show clearly, and how do I show it? And, so, doing that on a legal pad, which is, I think, how I ended up sending it to you guys, taking a picture of myself on camera, really helped, you know, me understand the crucial, and that's the crucial part of why chemotherapy actually works. So, it was a really interesting experience." "Yeah, we actually started that on a, we had a whiteboard, and I was trying to figure out that process. I think we started at the beginning from cell division and multiplying and, you know, chemotherapy working. But then it became so crazy that I had to pull back and start from the end and go in a different direction. So, that became quite a challenge, too, figuring it out." "We ended up using the visual that you gave us on the storyboard, which is really cool to have that sort of collaboration with the educator with whom you're working." "And I can't draw, so that should be noted. It was a very rough storyboard." "It was good enough." "Good enough!"
